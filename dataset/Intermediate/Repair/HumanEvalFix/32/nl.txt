Write a Python function `find_zero(xs: list)` to solve the following problem:
xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
find_zero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.
Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
a solution.
