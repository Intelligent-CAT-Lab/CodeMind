Write a Python function `make_palindrome(string: str) -> str` to solve the following problem:
Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
Algorithm idea is simple:
- Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
- Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
