Write a Python function `can_arrange(arr)` to solve the following problem:
Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which
is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If
no such element exists then return -1. The given array will not contain
duplicate values.
Examples:
can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5]) = 3
can_arrange([1,2,3]) = -1
