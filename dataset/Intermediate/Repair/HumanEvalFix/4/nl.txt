Write a Python function `mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float` to solve the following problem:
For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
around the mean of this dataset.
Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
MAD = average | x - x_mean |
