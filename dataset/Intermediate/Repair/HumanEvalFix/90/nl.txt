Write a Python function `next_smallest(lst)` to solve the following problem:
You are given a list of integers.
Write a function next_smallest() that returns the 2nd smallest element of the list.
Return None if there is no such element.
next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2
next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]) == 2
next_smallest([]) == None
next_smallest([1, 1]) == None
