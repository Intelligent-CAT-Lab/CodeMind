Now think step by step and end your response with \"END-OF-REASONING\":\n\nThe variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.\nIt enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.\nInside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current integer num by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.\nThen it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current integer i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.\nAfter the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable answer as output, which is 84.\nEND-OF-REASONING\n\n\nQuestion:\nWhat would be the states of variable n in line 12?

If the count is greater than 0, it adds i and its count to pMap.\nAfter the for loop, it checks if n is not equal to 1. If it is not, it means n is a prime number and it adds n and a count of 1 to pMap.\nIt initializes a variable ans to 0.\nIt enters another for loop that iterates over the values of pMap, which are the counts of the prime factors. For each count, it enters a while loop that subtracts i from the count and increments ans by 1.
