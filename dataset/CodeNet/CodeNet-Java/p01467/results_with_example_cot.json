If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.\nAfter the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.\n\nPrint the output of code execution and end your response with \"END-OF-OUTPUT\":\n84\nEND-OF-OUTPUT",
