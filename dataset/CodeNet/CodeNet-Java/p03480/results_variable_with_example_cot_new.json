You need to print the state of some variables.\nFor example:\n\nConsider the following code:\n1 import java.io.BufferedReader;\n2 import java.io.InputStreamReader;\n3 \n4 public class Main {\n5 \n6\t public static void main(String[] args) {\n7\t\t try {\n8\t\t\t InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);\n9\t\t\t BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);\n10\t\t\t String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(\" \");\n11 \n12\t\t\t int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);\n13\t\t\t int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);\n14\t\t\t int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);\n15\t\t\t int answer = 0;\n16 \n17\t\t\t for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {\n18\t\t\t\t int num = i;\n19\t\t\t\t int sum = 0;\n20 \n21\t\t\t\t while (num != 0) {\n22\t\t\t\t\t sum += num % 10;\n23\t\t\t\t\t num /= 10;\n24\t\t\t\t }\n25 \n26\t\t\t\t if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {\n27\t\t\t\t\t answer = answer + i;\n28\t\t\t\t }\n29\t\t\t }\n30\t\t\t System.out.println(answer);\n31\t\t } catch (Exception e) {\n32\t\t\t e.printStackTrace();\n33\t\t }\n34\t }\n35 \n36 }\n\nGiven the following input:\n20 2 5\n\nPlease first analyze the program.

And variable sum is initialized with 0.\nIt enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.\nInside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.\nThen it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.\nAfter the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.\nEND-OF-REASONING\n\n\nQuestion:\nWhat would be the states of variable n in line 12?
