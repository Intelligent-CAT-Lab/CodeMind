Now think step by step and end your response with \"END-OF-REASONING\":\n\nThe variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.\nIt enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.\nInside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.\nThen it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.\nAfter the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.\nEND-OF-REASONING\n\n\nQuestion:\nWhat would be the states of variable n in line 12?

Inside the loop, it initializes a variable temp with the value of i. It then enters another for loop starting from j=2 and iterates up to the square root of temp. Inside this loop, it checks if j is a factor of temp. If it is, it increments the count of j in the cnt array and divides temp by j repeatedly until j is no longer a factor of temp.\n\nAfter the inner loop finishes, it checks if temp is greater than 1.
