Now think step by step and end your response with \"END-OF-REASONING\":\n\nThe variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.\nIt enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.\nInside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current integer num by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.\nThen it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current integer i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.\nAfter the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable answer as output, which is 84.\nEND-OF-REASONING\n\n\nQuestion:\nWhat would be the states of variable n in line 12?

The Rubik's Cube is represented by an array of integers called \"is\". Each integer represents a color on the cube. The program uses a series of switch statements to determine which move to perform based on the input character. Each move is implemented as a method that swaps the appropriate elements in the \"is\" array to simulate the movement of the Rubik's Cube. After performing the move, the program prints the current state of the Rubik's Cube by mapping the integers in the \"is\" array to their corresponding colors.\n\nIn this case, the input is \"R\", which corresponds to the \"right\" move. The \"right\" method swaps the elements in the \"is\" array to simulate a clockwise rotation of the right face of the Rubik's Cube.
