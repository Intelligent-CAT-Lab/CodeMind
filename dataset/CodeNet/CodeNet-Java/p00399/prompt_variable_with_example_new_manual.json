The states of a variable refers to the values it can hold during the execution of the code.\nIf a line is executed for multiple times, then the variables in the line will have multiple states.\nBelow is an example.\n[[[Example Start]]]\nConsider the following code:\n<<Code>>\n1 import java.util.Scanner;\n2 public class Main {\n3    public static void main(String[] args) {\n4    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n5    int N = scanner.nextInt();\n6    int base = 0;\n7    for(int i = 0; i < N/2; i++){ // Variable `i` in initialized to 0 and its value will be incremented by 1 at the end of each loop iteration as long as the value of `i` is smaller than `N/2`.\n8        base += i;\n9        }\n10    System.out.println(base);\n11    }\n12 }\n\n<<Input>>\n6\n\n<<Round 1>>\n[Question]\nWhat would be the states of variable `N` after executing line 5? Print all the states and end your response with \"END-OF-STATE\".\n**Note: If the variable is in the loop, you should print the states in each iteration of the loop.**\n[Answer]\n6\nEND-OF-STATE\n\n<<Round 2>>\n[Question]\nWhat would be the states of variable `base` after executing line 6? Print all the states and end your response with \"END-OF-STATE\".\n**Note: If the variable is in the loop, you should print the states in each iteration of the loop.**\n[Answer]\n0\nEND-OF-STATE\n\n<<Round 3>>\n[Question]\nWhat would be the states of variable `N` in after executing 7? Print all the states and end your response with \"END-OF-STATE\".\n**Note: If the variable is in the loop, you should print the states in each iteration of the loop.**\n[Answer]\n6\n6\n6\n6\nEND-OF-STATE\n\n<<Round 4>>\n[Question]\nWhat would be the states of variable `base` after executing line 8? Print all the states and end your response with \"END-OF-STATE\".\n**Note: If the variable is in the loop, you should print the states in each iteration of the loop.**\n[Answer]\n0\n1\n3\nEND-OF-STATE\n\n<<Round 5>>\n[Question]\nWhat would be the states of variable `i` after executing line 8?
