The states of a variable refers to the values it can hold during the execution of the code.\nIf a line is executed for multiple times, then the variables in the line will have multiple states.\nBelow is an example.\n[[[Example Start]]]\nConsider the following code:\n<<Code>>\n1 import java.util.Scanner;\n2 public class Main {\n3    public static void main(String[] args) {\n4    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n5    int N = scanner.nextInt();\n6    int base = 0;\n7    for(int i = 0; i < N/2; i++){\n8        base += i;\n9        }\n10    System.out.println(base);\n11    }\n12 }\n\n<<Input>>\n6\n\n<<Round 1>>\n[Question]\nWhat would be the states of variable `N` in line 5? Print all the states and end your response with \"END-OF-STATE\".\n**Note: If the variable is in the loop, you should print the states in each iteration of the loop.**\n[Answer]\n6\nEND-OF-STATE\n\n<<Round 2>>\n[Question]\nWhat would be the states of variable `base` in line 6? Print all the states and end your response with \"END-OF-STATE\".\n**Note: If the variable is in the loop, you should print the states in each iteration of the loop.**\n[Answer]\n0\nEND-OF-STATE\n\n<<Round 3>>\n[Question]\nWhat would be the states of variable `N` in line 7?
