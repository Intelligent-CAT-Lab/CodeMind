And variable sum is initialized with 0.\nIt enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.\nInside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.\nThen it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.\nAfter the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.\nEND-OF-REASONING\n\n\nQuestion:\nWhat would be the states of variable n in line 12?
