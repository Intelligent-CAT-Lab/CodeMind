If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.\nAfter the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.\nEND-OF-REASONING\n\nPrint the output of code execution and end your response with \"END-OF-OUTPUT\":\n84\nEND-OF-OUTPUT\"",

In this case, the maximum digit is 3.\nThe code initializes two lists, ans and work, both with a length of (max_digit+1).\nThe code defines a recursive function called recursive, which takes two parameters: digit and tmp_sum. This function is used to generate all possible combinations of digits that sum up to W.\nInside the recursive function, if digit is -1, it means all digits have been processed. If tmp_sum is equal to W, it means the current combination of digits is valid. In this case, the code stores the current combination in the ans list.\nThe recursive function then calls itself three times, each time with a different value for the work[digit] variable: '0', '+', and '-'. This generates all possible combinations of digits.\nAfter the recursive function finishes, the code prints the digits in the ans list. It skips printing any leading zeros and prints '+' for positive digits and '-' for negative digits.\nEND-OF-REASONING"
