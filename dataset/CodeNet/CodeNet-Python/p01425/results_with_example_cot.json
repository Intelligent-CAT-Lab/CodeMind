If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.\nAfter the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.\nEND-OF-REASONING\n\nPrint the output of code execution and end your response with \"END-OF-OUTPUT\":\n84\nEND-OF-OUTPUT\"",

It returns -1 if x is less than lb, 1 if x is greater than ub, and 0 otherwise.\nThe check function takes two parameters qx and qy and checks if a projectile with initial horizontal velocity qx and initial vertical velocity qy can reach a target point (X, Y) without hitting any obstacles. It calculates the coefficients a, b, and c for a quadratic equation based on the projectile's motion and solves for the discriminant D. If D is negative, the projectile cannot reach the target. If D is zero, the projectile can reach the target but only at one specific time. If D is positive, the function checks for two possible times of flight and calculates the corresponding horizontal and vertical velocities. It then checks if the projectile's trajectory intersects with any obstacles. If it does not intersect with any obstacles, the function returns 1, indicating that the target can be reached. Otherwise, it returns 0.\nThe code then initializes the variables g, eps, N, V, X, and Y based on the input.\nNext, it initializes an empty list called obstacles.\nThen, it enters a loop that iterates N times, where N is the number of obstacles. For each iteration, it reads the coordinates of an obstacle (L, B, R, T) from the input. If the left coordinate of the obstacle is less than the target's x-coordinate, it appends a tuple containing the obstacle's coordinates to the obstacles list.\nAfter that, it checks if the target can be reached directly without hitting any obstacles by calling the check function with the target's coordinates (X, Y).
