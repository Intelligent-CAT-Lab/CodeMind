If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.\nAfter the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.\nEND-OF-REASONING\n\nPrint the output of code execution and end your response with \"END-OF-OUTPUT\":\n84\nEND-OF-OUTPUT\"",

The array is_prime is used to store whether a number is prime or not. The indices of the array represent the numbers, and the values represent whether the number is prime or not. The array is_prime is initialized with all False values, except for indices 2 and odd indices starting from 3, which are set to True.\n\nNext, there is a loop that iterates from 3 to U+1 with a step of 2. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number p is prime by checking if is_prime[p] is True. If it is, it sets all the multiples of p starting from p^2 to False in the is_prime array. This is done by setting is_prime[p*p::2*p] to 0.\n\nAfter that, the code creates an array called \"primes\" which stores all the prime numbers up to U. It does this by finding the indices of the True values in the is_prime array and converting them to int64 data type.\n\nThen, the code initializes a 2D array called \"A\" of size MMxMM, where MM is 510. The array A is initialized with all 1 values.\n\nNext, there is a loop that iterates from 0 to MM-1. Inside the loop, it checks if the current index n is even or odd.
