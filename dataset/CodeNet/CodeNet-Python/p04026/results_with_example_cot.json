You need to print the output of the code.\nFor example:\nConsider the following code:\n\nN, A, B = map(int, input().split())\nsum_1 = 0\nfor i in range(1,N+1):\n    sum_order = 0\n    i_str = str(i)\n    n = len(i_str)\n    for j in range(0,n):\n        sum_order += int(i_str[j])\n    if A <= sum_order <= B:\n        sum_1 += i\nprint(sum_1)\n\nWhat would be the output of code executiion given the following input:\n20 2 5\n\nNow think step by step and end your response with \"END-OF-REASONING\":\nThe variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.\nvariable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.\nThe code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.\nFor each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.\nThe code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.\nAfter the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.\nEND-OF-REASONING\n\nPrint the output of code execution and end your response with \"END-OF-OUTPUT\":\n84\nEND-OF-OUTPUT\"",

If they are equal, it prints the indices (i+1, i+3) and exits the program.\nIf no adjacent or two positions ahead characters are equal, the code prints (-1, -1) to indicate that no such pair of indices exists.\nIn this case, the string \"needed\" does not have any adjacent or two positions ahead characters that are equal, so the code will print (-1, -1).\nEND-OF-REASONING"
