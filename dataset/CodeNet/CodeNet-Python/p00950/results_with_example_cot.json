If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.\nAfter the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.\nEND-OF-REASONING\n\nPrint the output of code execution and end your response with \"END-OF-OUTPUT\":\n84\nEND-OF-OUTPUT\"",

If it is, the code prints 0 and exits.\nThe code defines a solve function that takes a read function as input.\nInside the solve function, there are several helper functions: next, error, number, factor, term, and expr.\nThe solve function uses a nonlocal keyword to access and modify variables from the outer scope.\nThe solve function checks if the number of \"=\" characters in s is exactly 1. If it is not, the function returns 0.\nThe solve function then calls the expr function to evaluate the left-hand side (lv) and right-hand side (rv) of the equation.\nIf the function has not encountered any errors and has reached the end of the input string, it returns 1 if lv is equal to rv, and 0 otherwise.\nThe get function is defined to create a read function based on a given permutation b of the base string.\nThe read function returns the corresponding character in s if it is in the base string or the character in b based on the mapping dictionary.\nThe code initializes the ans variable to 0.\nThe code then iterates over all permutations of the base string with length cnt"
