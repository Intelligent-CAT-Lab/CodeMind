If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.\nAfter the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.\nEND-OF-REASONING\n\nPrint the output of code execution and end your response with \"END-OF-OUTPUT\":\n84\nEND-OF-OUTPUT\"",
