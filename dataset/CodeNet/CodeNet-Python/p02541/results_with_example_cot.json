If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.\nAfter the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.\nEND-OF-REASONING\n\nPrint the output of code execution and end your response with \"END-OF-OUTPUT\":\n84\nEND-OF-OUTPUT\"",

It also defines a function crt(r, m) to solve the Chinese Remainder Theorem problem.\n\nThe main() function reads an integer n from input. It then calls the make_divisors(n) function to generate a list of divisors of 2 * n. The function make_divisors(n) returns a sorted list of divisors of n.\n\nThe variable ans is initialized to n-1 if n is odd, otherwise it is initialized to 2*n-1.\n\nThe code then iterates over the divisors list. For each divisor x, it calculates y = n * 2 // x. If y is equal to 1, the code continues to the next iteration.\n\nThe code then sets r = [0, y-1] and m = [x, y]. It calls the crt(r, m) function to solve the Chinese Remainder Theorem problem with the given remainders and moduli. If the solution is valid (rem != 0 and mod != 0), it updates ans to the minimum of ans and rem.\n\nFinally, the code prints ans if n-1 is true, otherwise it prints 1.\n\nIn this case, n = 11. The divisors of 2 * n = 22 are [1, 2, 11, 22]. The code iterates over these divisors and finds that x = 11 and y = 4. It sets r = [0, 3] and m = [11, 4]. It calls the crt(r, m) function and finds that rem = 0 and mod = 0, so it continues to the next iteration. There are no other valid solutions, so the code prints 1.\n\nEND-OF-REASONING"
