The provided Python code could be translated to the following Java code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.math.BigInteger;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FastReader fr = new FastReader();
        int a = fr.nextInt();
        int b = fr.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a * b / 2);
    }

    static class FastReader {
        BufferedReader br;
        StringTokenizer st;

        public FastReader() {
            br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        }

        String next() {
            while (st == null || !st.hasMoreElements()) {
                try {
                    st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
            return st.nextToken();
        }

        int nextInt() {
            return Integer.parseInt(next());
        }         
    }
}
```

Please note the following points when translating Python to Java:
- Python has many high-level constructs which have no direct equivalent in Java, for example, `defaultdict`, `deque`, `Counter` and others from `collections`, various methods from `heapq` and `itertools` modules which are not available as native Java utilities.
- `input()`, `I()`, `Is()`, and related methods are typically related to reading data in Python; in Java, we use `Scanner` or `BufferedReader` along with `StringTokenizer` to read and parse input.
- Python uses a dynamic type system, while Java is statically typed. Hence, we have to specify types explicitly.
- Java uses `System.out.println` for printing to the console, while Python uses `print`.
- The division operator in Python `/` will give a floating-point result if operands are float or they will perform integer division and give an integer result. In Java, the `/` operator will perform integer division if both operands are integers, otherwise, it will give a floating-point result.
- Python's ability to unpack tuple into variables (`a, b, c = Is()`) is translated to multiple variable declarations and assignments in Java.
- The example uses a custom `FastReader` class for fast input handling in Java, which is commonly used in competitive programming. Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `input()` with implicit stripping of newline characters.
- The large constants like `MOD`, `INF`, and `sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)` are not included in the Java example because they are context-dependent, and Java handles recursion limits and large value manipulations differently.
- Exception handling is needed in Java when dealing with I/O operations.

However, please note that some parts of the Python code (like functions to generate permutations, combinations, or to manipulate heaps) would require considerable additional code in Java to achieve similar functionality or incorporate third-party libraries since Java's standard library doesn't have direct equivalents for everything found in Python's itertools or heapq modules.
