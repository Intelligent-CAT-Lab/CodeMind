Below is the conversion of the given Python code to Java. There isn't a direct analog for every Python function or module (like `heapq`, `bisect`, or `collections`), but the code provided focuses on the core logic of dynamic programming to solve a problem that is assumed to be related to counting ways something can be done based on the input constraints.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    private static final int MOD = 1000000007; // 10^9 + 7

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();

        long[][][] dp = new long[n + 1][n + 1][k + 2 * (n + 1)];

        dp[0][0][0] = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; ++j) {
                for (int l = 0; l <= k; ++l) {
                    if (l + 2 * (j + 1) < dp[0][0].length) {
                        dp[i + 1][j + 1][l + 2 * (j + 1)] += dp[i][j][l];
                        dp[i + 1][j + 1][l + 2 * (j + 1)] %= MOD;
                    }

                    if (l + 2 * j < dp[0][0].length) {
                        dp[i + 1][j][l + 2 * j] += dp[i][j][l] * (j * 2 + 1);
                        dp[i + 1][j][l + 2 * j] %= MOD;
                    }

                    if (j > 0 && l + (j - 1) * 2 < dp[0][0].length) {
                        dp[i + 1][j - 1][l + (j - 1) * 2] += dp[i][j][l] * j * j;
                        dp[i + 1][j - 1][l + (j - 1) * 2] %= MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(dp[n][0][k] % MOD);
        sc.close();
    }
}
```

Please note that this translation assumes that `sys.stdin.readline()` gets replaced by Java's `Scanner` class, which is used to read input from `System.in`. Java doesn't have built-in `defaultdict`, `deque`, `Counter`, `heapq`, `bisect`, `permutations`, `accumulate`, `combinations`, or `string` modules, so any references to those would need to be either implemented from scratch or adjusted to fit Java's standard libraries.

For simplicity, the translation focuses on the dynamic programming part (the `dp` array calculation and the output of the result). It's difficult to directly translate some of the utility functions (`LI`, `I`, `LS`, `S`, etc.) since they depend on how input is processed, which is highly context-dependent in Python. In Java, the `Scanner` class or other I/O classes would need to be used to achieve similar functionality. 

Also, keep in mind that the translated code has not been optimized for Java's specific features or best practices and is designed to follow the structure and logic of the provided Python code as closely as possible.
