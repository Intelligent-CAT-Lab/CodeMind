Here's the Python code translated into Java, enclosed in the markdown code block as requested:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num = scanner.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println(num * 32);
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This Java code mimics the behavior of the provided Python script, taking an integer input from the user and then printing out that number multiplied by 32.
