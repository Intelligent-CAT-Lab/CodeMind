Below is the Java equivalent of the provided Python code. In Java, there isn't a direct equivalent of Python's `read`, `readline`, and `readlines` methods for stdin, so reading from standard input for integers is typically done using a `Scanner` or a `BufferedReader` along with an `InputStreamReader`. The rest of the logic for the underlying problem the Python code seems to address is translated to Java quite literally:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        int N = Integer.parseInt(reader.readLine());
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        while (N != 0) {
            N--;
            res.append((char) ('a' + N % 26));
            N /= 26;
        }
        System.out.println(res.reverse().toString());
    }
}
```

Keep in mind that in Java you need to handle exceptions such as `IOException`, which can be thrown when performing input and output operations. This is one of the major differences between Java and Python - Java's checked exceptions.

In the given Python code, the standard input is read using the `buffer` property of `sys.stdin`, which gives access to a buffered binary stream of the input. Java's `BufferedReader` gives buffered access to characters, which we then convert to an integer using `Integer.parseInt` for the initial `N`. Java strings are immutable, hence we use a `StringBuilder` to efficiently append characters, and then we reverse the built string before printing it out, since the Python code reverses the string at the end (`res[::-1]`).
