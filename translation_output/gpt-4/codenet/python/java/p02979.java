Below is the translated Java code from Python. Since Java has a different syntax and handles inputs a bit differently, I've added a small helper to read integers from a console input using a Scanner. Also, the list-like structures used in Python were translated into two-dimensional and three-dimensional array structures in Java.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    private static final Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int K = scanner.nextInt();
        int M = scanner.nextInt();

        // limitの最大値（limitなし）
        int L = (N + 1) / 2 + 1;

        if (K % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println(((long)even(N / 2, K / 2, M) * even((N + 1) / 2, K / 2, M)) % M);
        } else {
            int[][][] dp0 = new int[L + 1][L + 1][L + 1];
            dp0[0][0][L] = 1;

            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                int[][][] dp1 = new int[L + 1][L + 1][L + 1];
                for (int x = 0; x <= L; x++) {
                    for (int y = 0; y <= L; y++) {
                        if (loop(x, y, K)) continue;
                        for (int z = Math.max(x, y); z <= L; z++) {
                            if (dp0[x][y][z] == 0) continue;
                            dp1[y][x + 1][z] = (dp1[y][x + 1][z] + dp0[x][y][z]) % M;
                            int zz = (y > x) ? z : L;
                            if (2 * y >= K + 3 && x > 0) {
                                zz = Math.min(zz, 1 + y - x + K / 2);
                            }
                            dp1[y][0][zz] = (dp1[y][0][zz] + dp0[x][y][z]) % M;
                        }
                    }
                }
                dp0 = dp1;
            }

            int ret = 0;
            for (int x = 0; x <= L; x++) {
                for (int y = 0; y <= L; y++) {
                    if (loop(x, y, K)) continue;
                    for (int z = Math.max(x, y); z <= L; z++) {
                        ret = (ret + dp0[x][y][z]) % M;
                    }
                }
            }

            System.out.println(ret);
        }
    }

    private static int even(int n, int k, int M) {
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][k + 1];
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
                dp[i + 1][0] = (dp[i + 1][0] + dp[i][j]) % M;
                if (j != k) {
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] = (dp[i + 1][j + 1] + dp[i][j]) % M;
                }
            }
        }

        return Arrays.stream(dp[n]).reduce(0, (subtotal, element) -> (subtotal + element) % M);
    }

    private static boolean loop(int x, int y, int K) {
        return (2 * x >= K + 1 && 2 * y >= K + 3);
    }
}
```

**Key Points to Note:**
1. I used an `int[][][]` array for three-dimensional structures and an `int[][]` array for two-dimensional structures as `List` or dynamically growing structures are not directly used in Java for such purposes.
2. In Java, we use `System.out.println()` for printing to the console.
3. In the Python version, there is a list comprehension and sum to add up the elements, for which I have used the Java 8 Stream API to calculate the sum in the `even` function.
4. The arithmetic for loop counters and limits is strictly checked since Java is zero-based indexing and avoids inclusive ranges which are often used in Python.
5. Since the problem handles large numbers, we need to ensure that multiplication does not exceed the integer limits before applying modulo, hence casting the product to `long` before taking `% M` in the first `System.out.println` call.
6. Because Java's arrays are initialized to 0 by default, we don't need to manually set the initial state as we do in Python.
7. Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `map(int, input().split())`, so the `Scanner` class is used to read the inputs from the console.
8. Input handling is assumed to be consistent and valid according to the Python script's expectations, so I did not include input validation checks for brevity.
