Here is the equivalent Java code to perform the same operations as the Python code provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read A, B, and C from user input
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        int C = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculate the value of 'get'
        int get = A - B;

        // Calculate the value of 'i'
        int i = C - get;

        // Ensure 'i' is not negative
        if (i < 0) {
            i = 0;
        }

        // Print the result
        System.out.println(i);

        // Close the scanner to prevent resource leaks
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

When you run this Java program, it expects three integer inputs separated by spaces on the same line, just like in the original Python code. The program reads the inputs, performs the calculations, and finally prints out the computed value of `i`. Remember that in Java, we typically encapsulate the code in a class, and we use a `Scanner` object to read input from the standard input stream.
