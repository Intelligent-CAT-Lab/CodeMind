Below is the equivalent Java code for the Python snippet you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DynamicProgrammingProblem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        
        int mod = 998244353;
        
        long[][] dp = new long[c + 2][d + 2];
        dp[a][b] = 1;
        
        for (int i = a; i <= c; i++) {
            for (int j = b; j <= d; j++) {
                dp[i][j] %= mod;
                dp[i + 1][j] = (dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j] * j) % mod;
                dp[i][j + 1] = (dp[i][j + 1] + dp[i][j] * i) % mod;
                dp[i + 1][j + 1] = (dp[i + 1][j + 1] - dp[i][j] * i * j % mod + mod) % mod;
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(dp[c][d]);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

Please note that Python and Java have different default integral types. Python can automatically handle big integers, whereas Java defaults to `int` type, which could overflow given the operations you are performing in your dynamic programming table. To accommodate for larger values, as well as modulus operations, I've used `long` type for the `dp` table in Java, as it offers a higher range. If the calculations can exceed the `long` range, you would have to use `BigInteger`.
