Here is the equivalent code in Python:

```python
# No import needed for input in Python

def p02789():  # Defining a function similar to the Java class method
    n = int(input())  # Getting integer input
    m = int(input())  # Getting another integer input
    if n == m:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

p02789()  # Calling the function
```

In Python, we don't need to import a module to get user input; we can directly use the `input()` function to obtain input from the user. The input is read as a string, so it's converted to an integer using `int()`. The function `p02789()` is defined to contain the logic, and it's called at the end. This structure is not necessary in Python, but it's used here to illustrate a similar structure to the Java class and main method.
