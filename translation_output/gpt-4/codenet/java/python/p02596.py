Below is the translated Python code:

```python
import sys

MOD = 1000000007

# Fast input reading method
def ni():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

# Starts here
if __name__ == "__main__":
    N = ni()

    l = len(str(N))
    m = 0
    for i in range(l):
        m = (10 * m + 7) % N

    i = l
    vis = [False] * N

    while True:
        if vis[m]:
            print(-1)
            break
        
        vis[m] = True

        if m == 0:
            print(i)
            break
        
        m = (10 * m + 7) % N
        i += 1
```

Please note:

- The Python code uses `sys.stdin.readline()` for fast input instead of `BufferedReader`.
- The PrintWriter is replaced with Python's `print` function for standard output (this is typically slower than PrintWriter you can buffer the output if necessary).
- Unlike Java, Python does not require explicit exception handling for I/O operations.
- Python uses zero-based indexing for lists (arrays). Therefore, if you're adapting this code to use an input file and an output file, you would need to adjust the file reading and writing accordingly. Python also doesn't require a static method setup for setting up the input and output streams.
