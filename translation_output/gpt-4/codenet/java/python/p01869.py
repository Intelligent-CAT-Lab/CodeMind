Here's the Java code translated to Python, with some adjustments for Python-specific syntax and constructs:

```python
import sys

class p01869:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__t__ = 1
        self.__f__ = 0
        self.__FILE_DEBUG_FLAG__ = self.__f__
        self.__DEBUG_FILE_NAME__ = "src/D1"
        self.hash = {}

    def is_all_8(self, d):
        while d > 0:
            if d % 10 != 8:
                return False
            d //= 10
        return True

    def func(self, n):
        if n in self.hash:
            return self.hash[n]

        same = False
        now = n
        res = -1
        max_len = len(str(n))
        for dlen in range(max_len, 0, -1):
            for i in range(1 << dlen):
                d = 0
                ten = 1
                for j in range(dlen):
                    if (i & (1 << j)) == 0:
                        d += ten * 8
                    else:
                        d += ten * 2
                    ten *= 10
                if n == d:
                    same = True
                    continue
                if now < d:
                    continue
                if now % d == 0:
                    res = max(res, self.func(now // d) + self.func(d))

        if same:
            res = max(res, 1)
        elif res == -1:
            res = -100000000

        self.hash[n] = res
        return res

    def solve(self):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            return

        res = self.func(n)
        print(-1 if res <= -1 else res)

    def run(self):
        if self.__FILE_DEBUG_FLAG__ == self.__t__:
            try:
                sys.stdin = open(self.__DEBUG_FILE_NAME__, 'r')
                print("FILE_INPUT!")
            except FileNotFoundError as e:
                print("File not found:", e)
                sys.exit()
        else:
            sys.stdin = sys.__stdin__

        self.solve()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p01869().run()
```

Please note the following differences:
- In Python, you can use the `input()` function to read from standard input, so there's no need for an equivalent `FastScanner` class.
- Division and modulo operators are already in integer form using `//` and `%` respectively, so there's no need for additional casting as you have in Java.
- The size of integers in Python is not limited to 32/64 bits, Python integers can grow to accommodate really large numbers.
- Instead of using an `ArrayList` or `Arrays`, I used a dictionary (`dict`) in Python to store memoization results.
- The `System.out.println` statements have been replaced with `print` statements.
- Exception handling is different in Python, using `try` and `except` blocks.
- The `FileInputStream` and `PrintWriter` have been replaced simply by redirecting `sys.stdin` for file input purposes, and using `print` for output.
- Instead of a `public class` with a `public static void main`, in Python, you define a class and call it within an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to execute. This is python's equivalent to Java's main method.

The rest of your code has been translated by trying to keep its logic intact and adjusting only what's necessary to make it Pythonic.
