Here is the equivalent Python code for the given Java code:

```python
# Import the necessary function from sys module to read input
from sys import stdin

class p02775:
    
    def run(self):
        N = "0" + stdin.readline().strip()
        l = len(N)
    
        # 0 = ãã¤ã, 1 = ã´ã£ãã, 2 = å¤ã
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(l + 1)]
    
        dp[0][0] = dp[0][2] = 1
    
        for i in range(1, l):
            c = int(N[i])  # Converting character to integer
            dp[i][0] = min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][2]) + 9 - c
            dp[i][1] = min(dp[i - 1][0] + 1, dp[i - 1][1]) + c
            dp[i][2] = min(dp[i - 1][0] + 1, dp[i - 1][1]) + c + 1
        
        # Uncomment the following line to use debug
        # self.debug(dp)
        
        dp[l - 1][0] += 1
        print(min(dp[l - 1][0], min(dp[l - 1][1], dp[l - 1][2])))

    def debug(self, *args):
        # This function is a simple replacement for the debug method in the original code.
        # It prints the arguments to standard error.
        from pprint import pprint
        pprint(args)

# The following is the entry point for the program execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    p02775().run()
```

Please note the following about the translation:

1. The `Scanner` class is replaced by `sys.stdin.readline()` to read the input in Python.
2. Array handling in Python is direct with list comprehensions.
3. The `debug` method in Java is replaced with a simple print using `pprint` from the `pprint` module for better structured output.
4. Python uses zero-based indexing, so we adjust the `for` loop accordingly.
5. I used the `strip()` method to remove newline characters when reading from stdin.
6. I left the `debug` call commented out as Python doesn't provide an equivalent of Java's `System.err.println`.

Remember, to run this code, make sure your Python environment reads the input as the code expects, or you may need to modify the input handling to fit your environment.
