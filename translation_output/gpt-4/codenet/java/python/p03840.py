Here's the corresponding code in Python:
```python
import sys

class In:
    def next(self):
        return input().strip()

    def next_int(self):
        return int(self.next())

    def next_long(self):
        return int(self.next())

    def next_char_array(self, n, m):
        return [list(self.next()) for _ in range(n)]

    def next_int_array(self, n):
        return [self.next_int() for _ in range(n)]

    def next_long_array(self, n):
        return [self.next_long() for _ in range(n)]

class Out:
    def println(self, *args):
        print(*args)

    def flush(self):
        sys.stdout.flush()

class p03840:
    def __init__(self):
        self.in_ = In()
        self.out = Out()

    def solve(self):
        ai = self.in_.next_int()
        ao = self.in_.next_int()
        at = self.in_.next_int()
        aj = self.in_.next_int()
        al = self.in_.next_int()
        as_ = self.in_.next_int()
        az = self.in_.next_int()
        ans = 0
        ans += ao
        if (ai % 2 + aj % 2 + al % 2) == 3:
            ans += ai + aj + al
        elif (ai % 2 + aj % 2 + al % 2) == 2:
            if ai != 0 and aj != 0 and al != 0:
                ans += ai + aj + al - 1
            else:
                ans += ai + aj + al - 2
        elif (ai % 2 + aj % 2 + al % 2) == 1:
            ans += ai + aj + al - 1
        else:
            ans += ai + aj + al
        self.out.println(ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    solver = p03840()
    solver.solve()
    solver.out.flush()
```

Notes:
- `BufferedReader` and `PrintWriter` Java functionalities are replaced with Python's built-in I/O functions.
- Java's `StringTokenizer` is not needed in Python, as string splitting is built into the string type.
- Unnecessary parameters (like Java's array size parameters) are omitted as Python's lists are dynamic.
- Python does not use explicit type casting; therefore, `parseInt` and `parseLong` are replaced with `int` and `int` respectively (since Python does not distinguish between integers and longs in the same way as Java).
- Python uses `def` to define methods/functions instead of Java's combination of return type and method name.
- Removed the `$` argument from `main`. It's not needed in Python.
- Python does not support method overloading; hence, methods that take different parameters are distinctly named.
- The `mod`, `iinf`, and `inf` variables are declared but not used in the provided Java code snippet. I have not included them in the Python translation.

**Important note:** This Python version assumes Python 3.x due to the use of `print` as a function and `input()` instead of `raw_input()`.
