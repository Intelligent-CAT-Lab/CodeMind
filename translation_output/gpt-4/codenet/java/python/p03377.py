Here's the translated code in Python:

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
x = int(input())

if a + b >= x and a <= x:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
``` 

This Python script performs the same logic as the Java code. The user inputs are read using `input()` and converted to integers. Then the condition is checked, and either "YES" or "NO" is printed based on the result.
