Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java snippet:

```python
n = input()  # Read a string from the user
print("Yes" if "7" in n else "No")
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer as a string (`input()` function in Python automatically reads input as a string), then checks if the digit "7" is present in the string and prints "Yes" if it is, or "No" if it isn't. No need to explicitly import a Scanner class or convert the integer to a string, since `input()` handles that and Python's syntax is more concise.
