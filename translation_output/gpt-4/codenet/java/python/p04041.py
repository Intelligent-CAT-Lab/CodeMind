Here's the translation of the provided Java code into Python:

```python
import sys
import itertools

MOD = 1_000_000_007

def solve():
    n, x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    sum_xyz = x + y + z + 1
    mask = (1 << sum_xyz) - 1
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(mask + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    ng = (1 << z) | (1 << (y + z)) | (1 << (x + y + z))
    dp[0][1] = 1
    for i in range(n):
        for state in range(mask + 1):
            for j in range(1, 11):
                res = ((state << j) & mask) + 1
                if (res & ng) == ng:
                    continue
                dp[i + 1][res] += dp[i][state]
                dp[i + 1][res] %= MOD
    ans = pow(10, n, MOD)
    for i in range(mask + 1):
        ans -= dp[n][i]
        ans = (ans + MOD) % MOD
    print(ans)

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    solve()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Please note the following changes:

1. I've removed the class structure, as it's not typically used in Python for scripting purposes.
2. The methods that deal with input (`ns`, `ni`, `na`, `nl`, `nm`, etc.) have been replaced with direct use of the `input()` function and other parsing functions like `map` and `int`.
3. Instead of using `PrintWriter`, the Python program simply calls `print()`.
4. All necessary variable initializations have been converted to Python syntax.
5. The bitwise operations and modular arithmetic have been preserved.
6. In Java, the entry point is `public static void main(String[] args)`. In Python, this is typically handled by including an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block at the end of the script.
7. The Python solution does not maintain the performance optimizations related to buffered input, as in the original Java code, because standard input mechanisms are used.
8. Python uses zero-based indexing, unlike Java which starts indexing from one, so indexing adjustments are made accordingly.
9. The infinite while loops present in the Java input methods `ni` and `nl` are replaced with suitable Python idioms.
