Here is the Python equivalent of your Java code:

```python
# No imports are needed for this simple script

def main():
    a = input()
    b = input()
    if a == b:
        print("H")
    else:
        print("D")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code expects two lines of input, just like your original Java code. If the inputs are equal, it prints "H"; otherwise, it prints "D".
