Here's the Python version of the given Java code:

```python
def main():
    akihabara = "AKIHABARA"
    kihbr = "KIHBR"
    s = input()

    j, k = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if (
            j + 1 < len(akihabara) and
            akihabara[j] == 'A' and
            akihabara[j] != s[i]
        ):
            j += 1

        if j >= len(akihabara) or akihabara[j] != s[i]:
            print("NO")
            return
        
        if s[i] != 'A':
            if s[i] == kihbr[k]:
                k += 1
            else:
                print("NO")
                return
        
        j += 1

    if k == len(kihbr):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In Python, we use `input()` instead of a `Scanner` to read from the standard input. Note that we do not need to import a package to use `input()`. Also, the `main()` method is replaced with a non-class-based `main()` function, and the array indexing is slightly different since Python doesn't use method calls for accessing characters in a string (`charAt(j)` in Java becomes `s[i]` in Python). String lengths are accessed via `len(s)` instead of `s.length()`. Checking if a Python script is running directly is done by comparing `if __name__ == "__main__":`. The print statements are also replaced with Python's `print` function.
