```python
import sys

# Input handling mechanism similar to the above Java code
def ns():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

def ni():
    return int(ns())

def nl():
    return int(ns())

def modpow(a, n, mod):
    res = 1
    while n > 0:
        if (n & 1) == 1:
            res = res * a % mod
        a = a * a % mod
        n >>= 1
    return res

def solve():
    n = nl()
    mod = 1000000007
    total = modpow(10, n, mod)
    partial = 2 * modpow(9, n, mod)
    both = modpow(8, n, mod)
    ans = (total - partial + both) % mod
    ans = (ans + mod) % mod
    print(ans)

# Similar to main method in Java
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

In the provided Python code, I've replaced all the Java classes that handled input with the Python `sys.stdin.readline()` function, which must be used to retrieve input from `stdin`. The Python code will read and handle the input line by line, strip off the newline character, and convert it to the required data type. The modpow function is a direct translation of the modular exponentiation function from the Java code.

Please keep in mind that Python takes care of big numbers internally, so there is no need for custom buffer handling as in Java. Additionally, as Python is a dynamically typed language, there is no need to declare static variables and data types explicitly. I've omitted the time measurements and the debugging/tracing functionality (`tr` method in Java) since those were not explicitly required to solve the problem.
