Here's the Python equivalent of the Java code you provided enclosed in triple backticks:

```python
# No need to import a Scanner equivalent, as Python has built-in input functions.
S = input()  # Reads input from the user.
S = S.replace("eraser", "-")
S = S.replace("erase", "-")
S = S.replace("dreamer", "-")
S = S.replace("dream", "-")
S = S.replace("-", "")
if len(S) == 0:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")

# The commented-out Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) code is not translated, as it seems to be a placeholder for future revision.
```

This Python code will function similarly to the original Java code. In Python, the `input()` function is used to read a line of text from standard input. Also, the `replace` method in Python is used to replace occurrences of a substring within a string with another substring. Since Python has built-in garbage collection, we don't need to explicitly close the `Scanner` or equivalent input resources like you would in Java.
