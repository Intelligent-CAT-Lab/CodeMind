Here is the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
import sys

def main():
    x = int(input())
    
    ans = x // 11 * 2 + x % 11 // 7 + min(x % 11, 1)
    print(ans)
    sys.stdout.flush()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This Python code takes an integer input from the user, computes the value for `ans` using the same logic as the original Java code, and outputs it. The `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to ensure that the output is immediately written to standard output, which is a behavior emulated from the Java code `out.flush()`. The `Scanner` class in Java has been replaced by the built-in function `input()` in Python which reads a line from standard input and converts it to an integer using `int()`.

Keep in mind that in Python, `//` operator is used for floor division, which is analogous to `/` operator for integers in Java. The `min()` function in Python serves the same purpose as `Math.min()` in Java.
