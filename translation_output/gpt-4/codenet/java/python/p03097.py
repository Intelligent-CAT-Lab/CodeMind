Below is the Python equivalent of the provided Java code:

```python
import sys
from typing import List, Optional

def drop_bit(n: int, index: int) -> int:
    higher = (n >> (index + 1)) << index
    lower = n & ((1 << index) - 1)
    # print(f"n: {n}, index: {index}, higher: {higher}, lower: {lower}")
    return higher | lower

def insert_bit(n: int, index: int, v: int) -> int:
    higher = (n >> index) << (index + 1)
    lower = n & ((1 << index) - 1)
    return higher | lower | v

def solve_sub(n: int, a: int, b: int) -> Optional[List[int]]:
    # print(f"n: {n}, a: {a}, b: {b}")
    if n == 1:
        if a != b:
            return [a, b]
        else:
            return None
    
    for i in range(n):
        a_bit = (a >> i) & 1
        b_bit = (b >> i) & 1
        if a_bit != b_bit:
            a_dash = drop_bit(a, i)
            b_dash = drop_bit(b, i)
            # print(f"i: {i}, aDash: {a_dash}, bDash: {b_dash}")
            c = a_dash ^ 1
            path1 = solve_sub(n - 1, a_dash, c)
            path2 = solve_sub(n - 1, c, b_dash)
            if path1 is not None and path2 is not None:
                path = [insert_bit(v, i, a_bit << i) for v in path1]
                path += [insert_bit(v, i, b_bit << i) for v in path2]
                return path
            return None
    return None

def solve(n: int, a: int, b: int) -> List[str]:
    path = solve_sub(n, a, b)
    if path is None:
        return ["NO"]
    return ["YES", ' '.join(map(str, path))]

# Assuming sys.stdin works similar to Java's System.in here,
# and sys.stdout works similar to System.out.

def read_integer():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

def execute():
    n = read_integer()
    a = read_integer()
    b = read_integer()
    for line in solve(n, a, b):
        sys.stdout.write(line + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    execute()
```

In Python, we don't use a separate class for reading input and writing output as in the Java code, instead we directly use `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout`. I replaced the `ContestReader` class from the Java code with a `read_integer()` function in Python for simplicity.

Also please notice that Python's exception handling and stack traces are different from Java's, so I didn't convert that part of the `ContestReader` functionality. If necessary, more sophisticated input handling could be added by parsing and splitting input lines as needed.

Differences include native integer parsing and string joining functionality as well as a different approach to the base `main` execution. Python's `Optional` from the `typing` module is used to represent a value that could be either an actual value or `None`, similar to Java's nullable types.
