Here is the translated Python code for the given Java code:

```python
import math

class p02677:
    def __init__(self):
        self.solve()

    def solve(self):
        A, B, H, M = map(int, input().split())
        a_x = float(A) * math.sin(math.pi * 2 * (H * 60 + M) / 720)
        b_x = float(B) * math.sin(math.pi * 2 * M / 60)
        a_y = float(A) * math.cos(math.pi * 2 * (H * 60 + M) / 720)
        b_y = float(B) * math.cos(math.pi * 2 * M / 60)
        print(math.sqrt((a_x - b_x) ** 2 + (a_y - b_y) ** 2))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main = p02677()
```

Please note that I have only translated the portion of the original Java code that is relevant to operation because the original Java code includes many classes and interfaces which do not seem to be used in the `solve` method, and translating all of them would be unnecessarily verbose. If you need more classes translated or if there are specific functionalities you are interested in, let me know, and I will assist further. 

Additionally, Python does not need a `Scanner` class like Java to read inputs because Python provides built-in functions such as `input()` to read input from the user and `map()` to apply conversion functions to the inputs.

To execute this Python code, you just need to run the script, and it will wait for input from standard input. Be sure to input four space-separated numbers as expected by the `solve` method (e.g., "30 40 5 55").
