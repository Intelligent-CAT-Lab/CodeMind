Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```python
def solve(n, K):
    mod = 998244353
    ans = 0

    # DP for not taking any two consecutive L
    dp = [0] * K
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(n):
        ndp = [0] * K
        for j in range(K):
            for k in range(3):
                if j + k < K:
                    ndp[j + k] = (ndp[j + k] + dp[j]) % mod
        dp = ndp
    ans += sum(dp)
    ans %= mod

    # Counting sequences with some pairs
    fif = enumFIF(10000, mod)
    for s in range(K + 1, 2 * K - 1, 2):
        u = s - K
        if u % 2 == 1:
            u += 1
        two = u // 2 + (s - (K - 1)) // 2
        for i in range((s - two * 2 + 1) // 2, s - two * 2 + 1):
            ans += C(i, s - two * 2 - i, mod, fif) * C(n, i + two, mod, fif)
            ans %= mod

    # Edge case when K is odd
    if K % 2 == 1:
        ans += pow(2, n, mod)
        dp = [0] * K
        dp[0] = 1
        for i in range(n):
            ndp = [0] * K
            for j in range(K):
                for k in range(2):
                    if j + k < K:
                        ndp[j + k] = (ndp[j + k] + dp[j]) % mod
            dp = ndp
        ans -= sum(dp)
    ans = (ans + mod) % mod

    return ans

def C(n, r, mod, fif):
    if n < 0 or r < 0 or r > n:
        return 0
    return fif[0][n] * fif[1][r] % mod * fif[1][n - r] % mod

def enumFIF(n, mod):
    f = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        f[i] = f[i - 1] * i % mod
    a = f[n]
    b = mod
    p, q = 1, 0
    while b > 0:
        c = a // b
        a, b = b, a % b
        p, q = q, p - c * q
    invf = [0] * (n + 1)
    invf[n] = p + mod if p < 0 else p
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        invf[i] = invf[i + 1] * (i + 1) % mod
    return [f, invf]

def pow(a, n, mod):
    ret = 1
    a %= mod
    while n:
        if n & 1:
            ret = ret * a % mod
        a = a * a % mod
        n >>= 1
    return ret

# Read input and call the function
# Assuming the input values for n and K are provided accordingly
n, K = map(int, input().split())
print(solve(n, K))
```

Please note that the `solve` function now takes `n` and `K` as arguments, which would have been read from the input in the Java code. The Python version assumes that some other part of the code (not included in the snippet) collects those input values.

This Python code does not include reading of input and output handling, as it's assumed that this would be handled elsewhere. It also leaves out the tracing/debugging functions, and the parts that dealt with input reading were not converted, since Python has built-in functions that fulfill the same role in a much simpler way.
