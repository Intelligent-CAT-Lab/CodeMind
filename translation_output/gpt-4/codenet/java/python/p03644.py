Here is the translated Python code:

```python
import math
import sys


def run():
    pnum = int(input())
    print(count(pnum))


def count(pnum):
    result = 0
    i = 0
    while (2 ** i) <= pnum:
        result = 2 ** i
        i += 1
    return result


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

The Java code has been transformed to Python with the following changes:

1. Java's System.out with PrintWriter and BufferedOutputStream is replaced by Python's built-in `print()` function.
2. Java's `Scanner` for input is replaced by Python's `input()` function.
3. The static method count is translated into a regular Python function.
4. The for loop has been replaced with a while loop for a more Pythonic way of calculating the power of 2 not exceeding `pnum`.
5. Python does not require explicit cast (int) when performing power operations with integers.

Please note that the I/O buffering and stream closures (out.close() and sc.close()) are not directly translated to Python, as Python's I/O handles buffering by default and cleans up automatically when the program exits or a file object goes out of scope.
