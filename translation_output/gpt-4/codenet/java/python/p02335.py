Here is the translated Java code to Python:

```python
MOD = 1000000007

class Combinatorics:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.fact = [0] * (n + 1)
        self.inv = [0] * (n + 1)
        self.finv = [0] * (n + 1)
        self.fact[0] = self.fact[1] = 1
        self.finv[0] = self.finv[1] = 1
        self.inv[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            self.fact[i] = self.fact[i - 1] * i % MOD
            self.inv[i] = MOD - self.inv[MOD % i] * (MOD // i) % MOD
            self.finv[i] = self.finv[i - 1] * self.inv[i] % MOD
    
    def combination(self, n, r):
        if n < r or r < 0:
            return 0
        return self.fact[n] * self.finv[r] % MOD * self.finv[n - r] % MOD

    def permutation(self, n, r):
        if n < r or r < 0:
            return 0
        return self.fact[n] * self.finv[n - r] % MOD

    def homogeneous(self, n, r):
        if n == 0 and r == 0:
            return 1
        return self.combination(n + r - 1, r)

def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    comb = Combinatorics(k)
    print(comb.combination(k, n))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # It is typical in Python to just call the `main` function
    # as Python scripts don't require a special thread with a specific stack size.
    main()
```

In Python, there's no need to create a new thread for the main execution function since Python is not designed the same way as Java in that respect. Also, handling input is much simpler in Python, as it provides built-in functions like `input()` and `map()`. The translated Python code assumes that the input will be provided in the same order as expected by the original Java program (first `n` and then `k`). There's also no direct translation for the `FastScanner` as Python's I/O is not as complex as Java's.
