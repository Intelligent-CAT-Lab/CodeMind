Here is the equivalent Python code using `int` for arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, as Python's built-in `int` type already supports this without the need for a separate `BigInteger` class like in Java:

```python
# Import the sys module to read from standard input
import sys

def main():
    # Read the number from standard input
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    cnt = 0

    # Use nested for loops to iterate through all pairs of numbers
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if i * j < n:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                # If the product is not less than n, break out of the inner loop
                break

    # Print the result
    print(cnt)

# Run the main method if this script is executed
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Note these changes made during the translation from Java to Python:

1. Python uses indentation for block structures instead of braces `{}`.
2. I've implemented a `main()` function to enclose the main functionality of the code which is a common practice in Python, though it is not strictly necessary.
3. Python's `range` function is used to create a range for the loops with `range(1, n+1)` equivalent to `1 to n` (inclusive) in Java.
4. Python's `int` type can handle large integers just like `BigInteger` in Java. Therefore, we can use '+' operator to increment the count.
5. In Java, `System.out.println(cnt)` is used to print to the console; in Python, we simply use `print(cnt)`.
6. The `if __name__ == '__main__'` block ensures that `main()` is called only when the script is executed directly and not when imported as a module.

Please note that Python requires you to read input differently from Java. In this case, the input is read from `sys.stdin.readline()` for demonstrative purposes, assuming input is given as the first line in standard input. You could also replace this with Python's built-in `input()` function if interactive input is expected.
