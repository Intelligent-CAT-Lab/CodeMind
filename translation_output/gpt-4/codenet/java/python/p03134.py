Here's the Java code translated into Python. It performs the same dynamic programming task as described in the Java code.

```python
import sys

MOD = 998244353

class Task:
    def solve(self, cc):
        n = len(cc)
        r = 0
        b = 0
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1
        
        for i in range(n):
            if cc[i] == '0':
                r += 2
            elif cc[i] == '1':
                r += 1
                b += 1
            else:
                b += 2
            for prev_use_red in range(i + 1):
                if prev_use_red + 1 <= r:
                    dp[i + 1][prev_use_red + 1] += dp[i][prev_use_red]
                    dp[i + 1][prev_use_red + 1] %= MOD
                prev_use_blue = i - prev_use_red
                if prev_use_blue + 1 <= b:
                    dp[i + 1][prev_use_red] += dp[i][prev_use_red]
                    dp[i + 1][prev_use_red] %= MOD
                    
        combin = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in range(n + 1):
            combin[i][0] = combin[i][i] = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, i):
                combin[i][j] = (combin[i - 1][j - 1] + combin[i - 1][j]) % MOD
                
        tto = 0
        for i in range(min(r, n) + 1):
            ways = dp[n][i]
            lr = r - i
            lb = b - (n - i)
            if lb < 0:
                continue
            ways *= combin[n][lr]
            ways %= MOD
            tto = (tto + ways) % MOD
            
        return tto

# This part simulates the Java main method
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # sys.stdin is used to simulate reading from the input stream
    sc = sys.stdin.readlines()
    t = Task()
    result = t.solve(sc[0].strip())
    print("Result:", result)
```

I've translated the Java class method to a Python class method. Furthermore, the Python code uses stdin to read input values, assuming that the input format will be identical to the one specified for the Java program. Also, it does not include the memory and execution time measurement snippet present in the Java main method, as these are not typically part of a Python script for algorithmic tasks; however, they can be added using Python's `time` and `resource` modules if needed.

Please ensure you provide the appropriate input for the script or adapt it if needed to match your source of data.
