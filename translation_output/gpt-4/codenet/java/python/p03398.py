Below is the Python equivalent of the provided Java code. Please note that in Python, everything is an object, including functions, which allows for a much more flexible design compared to Java. This Python code attempts to stay close to the structure and logic of the Java code, although some changes are necessary due to language differences.

```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

class TaskF:
    mod = 1000000007
    n = 0
    comb = []
    dp = []
    pp = set()
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_comb(sz, mod):
        comb = [[0 for _ in range(sz)] for _ in range(sz)]
        for i in range(sz):
            comb[i][0] = 1
            for j in range(1, i+1):
                comb[i][j] = comb[i-1][j] + comb[i-1][j-1]
                if comb[i][j] >= mod:

            for neg in range(left - pos + 1):
                if pos + neg == 0: 
                    continue
                take = pos + neg

        self.dp[left][excess] = ret % TaskF.mod
        return self.dp[left][excess]

Some notes about the conversion:

1. The `InputReader` and `OutputWriter` classes are not needed in Python because reading from and writing to the standard input and output is simple with the built-in functions `input` and `print`.
2. Java's static methods and variables have been converted into Python static methods and class variables.
3. The custom `deepFill` method is now a static method called `deep_fill`.
4. The `Debug` class from Java is omitted as it's not a standard part of the logic and appears to be developer-specific. In Python, debugging can be done with the built-in `print` function or using a debugger.
5. Java's `equals` and `hashCode` methods correspond to Python's `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods, respectively.
6. Python doesn't have an `ArrayList` or `HashSet` class per se; it uses lists (`[]`) and sets (`set()`) for similar functionality. They are dynamic and do not require predefining a type or size.
7. The main method is represented in Python as the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block at the end of the file, ensuring that `main()` is called only when the script is executed directly.
