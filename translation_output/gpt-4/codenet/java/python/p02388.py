Certainly! Below is the equivalent Python code that will read an integer from standard input and print its cube:

```python
def main():
    num = int(input())
    print(num ** 3)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Keep in mind that Python uses indentation for scoping instead of braces, and the function `input()` is used to read a line from standard input (which is presumed to be a string), then `int()` is used to convert that string to an integer. The exponentiation operator `**` is used to calculate the cube.
