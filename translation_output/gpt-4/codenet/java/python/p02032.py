Here is the Python translation of the given Java code:

```python
import sys
import io
import re


class CDivisorGame:

    @staticmethod
    def solve():
        n = int(input())
        pf = {}
        i = 2
        while i * i <= n:
            c = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
                c += 1
            if c > 0:
                pf[i] = c
            i += 1
        if n > 1:
            pf[n] = 1

        ans = 1
        for count in pf.values():
            ans *= (count + 1)

        LightWriter.ans(len(pf)).ans(ans - 1).ln()


class LightWriter:

    @staticmethod
    def ans(value):
        # Print on the same line with space separation for successive calls
        sys.stdout.write(' ')
        sys.stdout.write(str(value))
        return LightWriter

    @staticmethod
    def ln():
        # Print a new line after current output
        sys.stdout.write('\n')


# Debugging tool (unused in the translated Python code)
class Debug:
    enabled = False
    src = ''
    DEBUG_CALL_PATTERN = r'^.+\.debug\((.+)\);.*$'

    @staticmethod
    def enable(s):
        Debug.enabled = True
        Debug.src = s


def main():
    sys.stdin = io.StringIO(sys.stdin.read())
    CDivisorGame.solve()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The code above assumes that the input will be taken from `stdin` and the output will be printed to `stdout`. This is similar to the Java implementation, which reads from `System.in` and writes to `System.out`.

Do note that the `Debug` class and its functionalities, as well as the `uncheckedIOException`, are not used or translated because Python does not have a direct equivalent for unchecked exceptions or the debugging patterns present in the Java code. Additionally, I mimicked the behavior of the `LightWriter` class in a simplistic way, which is not class-based and uses standard Python I/O (`sys.stdout.write`). The function `ans()` is now a static method in the LightWriter class for simplicity, and I opted not to implement the `close()` method since Python closes files automatically at the end of the program's execution, and we did not maintain a file handle that would need an explicit close. The `autoflush` feature has also been left out since Python's standard output is typically line-buffered, meaning it flushes by itself when a newline character is written.

Remember that when running the Python code, the input must be provided in the same way expected by the original Java program, as there's no functionality implemented to read input in any other way.
