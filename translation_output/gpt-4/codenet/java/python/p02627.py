Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java source:

```python
str = input()
print("A" if str.isupper() else "a")
```

The Python code uses `input()` to read a string from standard input and the `str.isupper()` method to check if the string consists of uppercase letters. The ternary operator in Python has the form `a if condition else b`, which is used here to print `"A"` if the string contains an uppercase letter or `"a"` otherwise.
