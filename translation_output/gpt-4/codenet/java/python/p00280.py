Below is the translation of the provided Java code into Python. This translation assumes that the integer inputs `a` and `b` are separated by whitespace on a single line. Note that there is a typo in the Java method name `slove` which I have corrected to `solve` in the Python version.

```python
class P00280:
    def __init__(self):
        self.a = 0
        self.b = 0

    def run(self):
        self.a, self.b = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        self.solve(0, 0, "")

    def solve(self, x, y, s):
        if ((x == 5 and y < self.b and y != 4) or
           (y == 5 and x < self.a and x != 4)):
            return
        if x == self.a + 1 or y == self.b + 1:
            return
        if x == self.a and y == self.b:
            print(s)
        self.solve(x + 1, y, s + "A")
        self.solve(x, y + 1, s + "B")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    p = P00280()
    p.run()
```

This snippet converts the class-based Java program into a class-based Python program. In Python, we don't explicitly declare member variables like `int a, b;` outside of methods; instead, we set them up within `__init__`, the constructor. The methods are converted to regular Python instance methods, and since Python doesn't require declaring exceptions that can be thrown (`throws IOException`), error handling is not specified in the method definitions.

I took the liberty of assuming that the input is provided on a single line, separated by spaces, because Python's `input()` reads a whole line at a time. Also, the `print` statement in Python is used instead of `System.out.println` to output the string `s`.

Lastly, Python uses indentation to define the scope instead of braces `{}` as in Java, so ensure that you maintain proper indentation when implementing the Python version.
