Here's the translated Python code based on the provided Java code:

```python
import math
import sys

MODULO = 10**9 + 7

def gcd(n, m):
    if m == 0:
        return n
    return gcd(m, n % m)

def factors(n):  # returns a set of the prime factors of the number n
    fact = set()
    fact.add(1)
    for i in range(2, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        while n % i == 0:
            fact.add(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 1:
        fact.add(n)
    return fact

def main():
    # Assuming input is to be taken from stdin as per the FastReader class
    a = int(input().strip())
    b = int(input().strip())
    print(len(factors(gcd(a, b))))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code does away with various specifics of Java, such as the use of BufferedReader and StringTokenizer since Python's input handling is simpler. The `gcd` function is greatly simplified by using the built-in `gcd` function from the `math` module, but I've added the custom implementation as per the Java code. Similarly, the `factors` function makes use of Python sets, which are essentially like `HashSet` in Java. Finally, the main method directly reads two numbers (`a` and `b`) from the standard input, calculates the number of factors of their GCD and prints it to standard output.
