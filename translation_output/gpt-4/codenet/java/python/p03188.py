Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
import sys

def solve():
    k = int(input())

    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return

    n = (k + 3) // 4 * 2

    ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            ret[i][j] = (0 if i % 2 == 0 else n) + (i + j) % n

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if ret[i][j] >= k:
                ret[i][j] = (ret[i][j] - n) % k

    print(n)
    for i in range(n):
        print(' '.join(str(ret[i][j] + 1) for j in range(n)))

def main():
    start = time.time()
    solve()
    sys.stdout.flush()
    print((time.time() - start) * 1000, "ms", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Some notes about the Python code based on the Java original:

1. Python does not require a class for writing standalone scripts, so I removed the class definition.
2. The `solve` function prints the output directly, as Python can print to the console using the built-in `print` function. 
3. The `main` function calls `solve` and measures the time of execution, printing it to standard error as in the original Java program. We assume the input is being delivered via standard input (`sys.stdin` or `input()` function in Python).
4. The translation omits the additional threading and command-line argument handling in the Java version, focusing strictly on the core functionality of the program.

Please be aware that this Python version expects the input from the standard input, just like the Java program. If additional features of the Java code are desired (for example, threading, custom input stream handling), further changes to the Python code would be necessary.
