Here's the translated Python code:

```python
def solve(S):
    d = list(S)
    dp = [1] + [0] * 12
    base = 1
    MOD = 1000000007
    
    for i in range(len(d)-1, -1, -1):
        next_dp = [0] * 13
        if d[i] == '?':
            for k in range(10):
                for j in range(13):
                    next_dp[(k * base + j) % 13] += dp[j]
                    next_dp[(k * base + j) % 13] %= MOD
        else:
            k = int(d[i])
            for j in range(13):
                next_dp[(k * base + j) % 13] += dp[j]
                next_dp[(k * base + j) % 13] %= MOD
        dp = next_dp
        base = base * 10 % 13

    print(dp[5])

def main():
    S = input()
    solve(S)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code reads a string from standard input and uses dynamic programming to find the number of ways that the string can be interpreted as a number which is divisible by 13 when interpreted in a certain way. In the output, it prints the number of such ways modulo 10^9 + 7 where the number ends with a digit '5'.
