Here is the Java code translated to Python, enclosed within triple backticks as requested:

```python
class P02534:
    def __init__(self):
        self.k = int(input())
        
    def solve(self):
        answer = ""
        for i in range(self.k):
            answer += "ACL"
        return answer
    
    def show(self, answer):
        print(answer)

# The equivalent of the "public static void main" method in Java
if __name__ == "__main__":
    m = P02534()
    m.show(m.solve())
```

Note that the naming conventions for classes in Python typically use CamelCase, whereas variable and method names use snake_case. However, to maintain consistency with the provided Java code, I've kept the class name as 'P02534'. Additionally, Python does not require semicolons at the end of the line, and uses indentation to define blocks rather than braces.
