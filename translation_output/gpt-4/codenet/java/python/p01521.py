Here is the equivalent Python code for the Java snippet you provided:

```python
# No need to import anything for I/O in Python

# Define the main function
def main():
    # Read a string from the user input in Python
    s = input()
    # Check if the first and last character of the string are 'x'
    result = "x" if s[0] == 'x' and s[-1] == 'x' else "o"
    # Print the result
    print(result)

# Call the main function if the script is executed
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In the provided Python code, you don't need to import Scanner as you do in Java. Python's built-in `input()` function is enough to read input from the user. The `toCharArray()` method is not needed in Python as strings are already iterable as sequences of characters. We directly access the first and last character of the string using index `0` and `-1` respectively. The ternary conditional is replaced with Python's conditional expression which follows the `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false` syntax. Lastly, an explicit `main` function is defined, and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard is used to call `main` if the script is run as the main program.
