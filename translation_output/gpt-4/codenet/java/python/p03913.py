Here is the translated Python code:

```python
import math

class P03913:
    def run(self):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        self.solver(a, b)

    def solver(self, n, a):
        ans = n
        for m in range(2, 41):
            c = int(n**(1.0 / m))
            for i in range(max(c - 2, 2), c + 3):
                if math.log(i) * (m - 1) > 40 * math.log(2):
                    continue
                for j in range(m):
                    res = a * (m - 1)
                    res += j * i + (m - 1 - j) * (i + 1)
                    den = self.pow(i, j) * self.pow(i + 1, m - 1 - j)
                    res += (n + den - 1) // den
                    ans = min(ans, res)
        print(ans)

    def pow(self, a, n):
        ret = 1
        while n > 0:
            if n % 2 == 1:
                ret *= a
            a *= a
            n >>= 1
        return ret

    @staticmethod
    def tr(*objects):
        print(objects)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # t = time.time()
    P03913().run()
    # print("Elapsed time:", time.time() - t)
```

I've translated the Java code into Python keeping the logic and structure intact. The `Scanner` class is replaced by input with `map` to read two integers. I've emulated the array-based `pow` with a `while` loop in Python, as Python has built-in exponentiation using `**` operator which could be used if you don't need the intermediate squaring steps as shown in the original Java code. The `System.out.println` is replaced with `print`, and the `Math` functions are used from Python's `math` module. The Python code follows the PEP 8 naming conventions which differ from Java's naming conventions.
