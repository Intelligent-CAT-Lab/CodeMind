Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java source:

```python
import sys

# AIZU ONLINE JUDGE
# 0405
# 2020/5/6

class P00400:

    def __init__(self):
        self.log = None # In Python we typically won't use a dummy PrintStream equivalent.
        self.result = sys.stdout

    def main(self):
        # Python does not use a Scanner, simply read input directly
        N = input().strip()

        r = 0
        if 'A' <= N <= 'Z':
            r = 1
        elif 'a' <= N <= 'z':
            r = 2
        print("{}".format(r), file=self.result)

        return False


if __name__ == "__main__":
    instance = P00400()
    instance.main()
```

Please note the following translations:

- Java's `Scanner` object for reading input has been translated to Python's built-in `input` function which reads a line from standard input.
- Java's `PrintStream` used for `log` in the Java code does not have a direct equivalent in Python; you can use basic file handling or logging library for similar functionality. Since this `log` is not actually used in the main code, I've put `None` here and avoided this complexity.
- The `PrintStream` object `result` is translated to direct usage of `sys.stdout` in Python, which is Python's standard output stream.
- Java's `System.out` has been replaced by `sys.stdout` in Python.
- In Python, printing to a specified output stream is done using the `file` parameter of the `print` function.
- The `main` function in the Python class is not static; you call it on an instance of the class.
- The comparison logic is direct, as Python allows chained comparison operations.

Also, Python manages the closing of file streams automatically (especially for standard input and output), as opposed to manually closing the streams as required in Java.
