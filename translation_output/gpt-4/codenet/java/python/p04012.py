Here's the translated Python code for the given Java code:

```python
# No need to import anything since Python includes the necessary functionality natively

def main():
    w = input()  # Python uses input() instead of Scanner
    acha = ord('a')  # The ord() function gets the ASCII value of the character
    zcha = ord('z')
    count = 0
    for i in range(acha, zcha + 1):
        for x in w:  # Strings are iterable in Python
            if x == chr(i):  # The chr() function converts an ASCII value back to character
                count += 1
        if count % 2 == 1:
            print("No")
            return
        count = 0
    print("Yes")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python script preserves the functionality of the original Java program: it checks if each letter in the alphabet appears an even number of times in the input string (only lowercase letters are considered). If any letter appears an odd number of times, it prints "No" and exits. If all letters appear an even number of times or not at all, it prints "Yes".
