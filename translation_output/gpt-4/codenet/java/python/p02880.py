Here is the equivalent Python code for the given Java code:

```python
# Python doesn't require importing a scanner, input can be directly read from stdin
N = int(input())  # Read integer from input
f = False

for A in range(1, 10):  # Loop from 1 to 9
    if N % A == 0 and N // A < 10:  # Check if the conditions are met
        f = True
        break  # No need to check further if found

ret = "Yes" if f else "No"  # Ternary operator in Python
print(ret)
```

In this Python code, the input is taken using the `input()` function, and the integer conversion is done using `int()`. The range for loop in Python is non-inclusive of the upper bound, so we use `range(1, 10)` to loop through numbers 1 to 9. The division operation `//` is integer division in Python. The ternary conditional operation is simplified using the `if-else` statement in a single line.
