Certainly, below is the Java code translated into Python:

```python
import sys

MOD = int(1e9 + 7)
M = 2222
c = [[0 for _ in range(M)] for _ in range(M)]
c[0][0] = 1
for i in range(1, M):
    c[i][0] = 1
    for j in range(1, M):
        c[i][j] = c[i - 1][j - 1] + c[i - 1][j]
        if c[i][j] >= MOD:
            c[i][j] -= MOD

pow2 = [0 for _ in range(M)]
pow2[0] = 1
for i in range(1, M):
    pow2[i] = pow2[i - 1] * 2
    if pow2[i] >= MOD:
        pow2[i] -= MOD

dp2 = [[0 for _ in range(M)] for _ in range(M)]
for x in range(M):
    for y in range(M):
        if x == 0 or y == 0:
            dp2[x][y] = 1
        else:
            dp2[x][y] = dp2[x - 1][y - 1] + dp2[x][y - 1]
            if dp2[x][y] >= MOD:
                dp2[x][y] -= MOD

dp2_pref = [[0 for _ in range(M)] for _ in range(M)]
for x in range(M):
    for y in range(M):
        dp2_pref[x][y] = dp2[x][y]
        if x > 0:
            dp2_pref[x][y] += dp2_pref[x - 1][y]
            if dp2_pref[x][y] >= MOD:
                dp2_pref[x][y] -= MOD

dp = [[0 for _ in range(M)] for _ in range(M)]
for red in range(M):
    for blue in range(M):
        if red == 0 or blue == 0:
            dp[red][blue] = 1
        else:
            dp[red][blue] += dp2_pref[red][blue - 1]
            if dp[red][blue] >= MOD:
                dp[red][blue] -= MOD

def solve():
    global MOD, c, dp
    res = 0
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for start_red in range(a + 1):
        for cnt_blue in range(1, b + 1):
            cur_c = c[b - 1][cnt_blue - 1]
            red_stay = a - start_red - (b - cnt_blue)
            if red_stay < 0:
                continue
            add = cur_c * dp[red_stay][b - cnt_blue] % MOD
            res = (res + add) % MOD
    return res

def main():
    result = solve()
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code follows the structure of the Java implementation but adapted to Python's syntax and standard libraries. The functions `run()` and `runIO()` have been merged into a single `main()` function which reads input from `stdin`. Notice that unlike Java, we don't need to parse the entire input upfront in Python since we can easily read and parse line by line. The `FastScanner` class is not necessary here as Python's standard input functions are already fast enough for typical usage.
