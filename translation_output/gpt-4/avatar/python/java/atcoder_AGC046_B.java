Below is the translated Java code from the provided Python snippet:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        int C = sc.nextInt();
        int D = sc.nextInt();
        int m = 998244353;

        int[][] d = new int[C + 1][D + 1];
        d[A][B] = 1;

        for (int i = A; i <= C; i++) {
            for (int j = B; j <= D; j++) {
                if (i != A || j != B) { // Skip the initial cell
                    d[i][j] += (d[i][j - 1] * (long)i + d[i - 1][j] * (long)j - d[i - 1][j - 1] * (long)(i - 1) * (j - 1)) % m;
                    if (d[i][j] < 0) d[i][j] += m; // Ensure non-negative value
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(d[C][D]);
        sc.close();
    }
}
```

Things to note in the translation:
- Java does not have a built-in equivalent to Python's list comprehensions, so an explicit loop is needed to initialize the array `d`.
- The modulo operation is applied in a way to always return a non-negative value, which is done because Java's `%` operator can return negative values.
- Java does not handle arithmetic overflow automatically, so when dealing with potentially large numbers (multiplication of indices), it is best to ensure that arithmetic is done with appropriate data types (e.g., `long`) to prevent overflow.
- Unlike Python which can dynamically determine the type of a variable, Java requires explicit type declaration, and the declaration of `d` reflects this with `int[][]`.
- The `input()` equivalent in Java is using a `Scanner` to read from `System.in`.
- Java array indices start from 0, which aligns with the Python code expectations.
- The `print` function in Python is replaced by `System.out.println` in Java.
