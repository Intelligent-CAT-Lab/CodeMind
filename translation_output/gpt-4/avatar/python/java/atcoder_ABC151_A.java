Certainly! The provided Python code takes input from the user, gets the ASCII code of the input character, increments it by one, converts it back to a character, and prints the result. Here is how you might write equivalent code in Java:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class NextCharacter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); // Create a Scanner object to read input
        System.out.println("Enter a character: ");
        char inputChar = scanner.next().charAt(0); // Read the first character of the input string

        char nextChar = (char) (inputChar + 1); // Increment the character by one
        System.out.println(nextChar); // Output the result

        scanner.close(); // Close the scanner
    }
}
```

Note that this Java code includes a prompt for the user to enter a character, which wasn't part of the original Python code. If you would like the Java code to behave exactly like the Python code without prompting, you can remove the `System.out.println("Enter a character: ");` line. Additionally, Java requires more setup than Python for simple tasks like this, such as importing the `Scanner` class, creating an instance of `Scanner`, and explicitly closing it when finished.
