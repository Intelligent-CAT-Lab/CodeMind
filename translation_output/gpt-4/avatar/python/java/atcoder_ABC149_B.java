Certainly! Here's the equivalent Java code for the given Python snippet:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String number = scanner.nextLine();
        String[] parts = number.split(" \\s+"); // Assuming 'â–' represents a whitespace in the original string
        int a = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
        int b = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
        int k = Integer.parseInt(parts[2]);
        
        int res = a - k;
        if (res < 0) {
            a = 0;
            b += res;
            b = Math.max(b, 0);
        } else {
            a = res;
        }
        
        System.out.println(a + " " + b);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

Please note the following:
1. Since the split separator in the original Python code is ambiguous ('â–'), I've assumed it represents a whitespace. If this is not the case, you'll need to adjust the `split` argument accordingly.
2. `scanner.nextLine()` is used to read the entire line of input similarly to `input()` in Python.
3. We split the input string into parts and then parse the individual numbers.
4. Java doesn't support implicit type casting so we must parse the string to an integer using `Integer.parseInt()`.
5. Java does not have an inline `if` statement like Python, so `Math.max(b, 0)` is used to ensure that `b` does not fall below 0.
6. Java's `System.out.println` is used to print the output in a similar fashion to Python's `print` function.
7. I have also used a `try-with-resources` by declaring the `Scanner` within a `try` block, this way we ensure that the `Scanner` is closed after we're done using it.
