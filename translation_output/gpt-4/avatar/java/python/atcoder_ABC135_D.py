Here is the translated Python code for the provided Java snippet:

```python
def atcoder_ABC135_D():
    M = 1_000_000_007
    s = input().strip()
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(len(s) + 1)]
    map = [0, 4, 8, 12, 3, 7, 11, 2, 6, 10, 1, 5, 9]

    dp[0][0] = 1

    for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
        ch = s[i - 1]
        for j in range(13):
            if ch == '?':
                for k in range(10):
                    l = j - k
                    if l < 0:
                        l += 13
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][map[l]]
                    if dp[i][j] >= M:
                        dp[i][j] -= M
            else:
                l = j - (ord(ch) - ord('0'))
                if l < 0:
                    l += 13
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][map[l]]

    print(dp[len(s)][5])

# Call the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    atcoder_ABC135_D()
```

Please note that Python uses zero-based indexing, which I have accounted for in the loop ranges and list accesses. The `Scanner` from Java is substituted with `input().strip()` in Python, and the `System.out.println` is replaced with the `print` function. Additionally, I used a list comprehension syntax for creating the 2D list `dp`. Assuming you will run this Python code from the command line or an interactive environment, I've wrapped the main logic into a function `atcoder_ABC135_D` and called it under the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard to prevent it from executing when the module is imported.
