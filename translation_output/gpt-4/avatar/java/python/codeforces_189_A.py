Before translating the code to Python, there seems to be a textual error which has caused the word "class" to be replaced with "clcodeforces_189_Ass" and similar replacements for other keywords and variable names.

I will assume the original formatted Java code should look like this:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class A {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = in.nextInt();
        int[] a = new int[3];
        a[0] = in.nextInt();
        a[1] = in.nextInt();
        a[2] = in.nextInt();
        Arrays.sort(a);
        int max = 0;
        int d[] = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(d, -500);
        d[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (i - a[j] >= 0 && d[i - a[j]] != -1) {
                    d[i] = Math.max(d[i], d[i - a[j]] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(d[n]);
    }
}
```

Now, here is the translated Python code enclosed within triple backticks:

```python
def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(input()) for _ in range(3)]
    a.sort()
    d = [-500] * (n + 1)
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        for j in range(3):
            if i - a[j] >= 0 and d[i - a[j]] != -1:
                d[i] = max(d[i], d[i - a[j]] + 1)
    print(d[n])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Some notes on the translation:
- The `Scanner` class in Java is replaced with Python's `input()` function.
- Array definition and utilization replace Java arrays with Python lists.
- The `Arrays.sort()` method call is replaced with the `sort()` method on the Python list.
- `Math.max()` is replaced by Python's built-in `max()` function.
- The loop syntax is changed to Python's `for` loop with the `range()` function specifying the range of values.
- In Python, there is usually no need to specify a class for a simple script; the equivalent is a script inside an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block which will act as the entry-point for the program.
