Here's the equivalent Python code for the Java code you provided:

```python
def atcoder_ABC155_E():
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    S = "0" + input()
    N = len(S)
    c = [int(char) for char in S]
    
    dp = [[float('inf')] * 2 for _ in range(N + 1)]
    dp[N][0] = c[0]
    dp[N][1] = 10 - c[0]

    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(2):
            for k in range(10):
                tmp = c[i] + j
                tmp = k - tmp
                if tmp < 0:
                    dp[i][1] = min(dp[i][1], dp[i + 1][j] + tmp + 10 + k)
                else:
                    dp[i][0] = min(dp[i][0], dp[i + 1][j] + tmp + k)

    print(dp[0][0])

# You can call the function atcoder_ABC155_E() to run it
# atcoder_ABC155_E()
```

Before running this code, you need to call the function `atcoder_ABC155_E()`, and if you want to run it directly from the command line, uncomment the last line. Ensure your terminal or wherever you're running this is capable of taking user input as this function expects to receive an input at the beginning.
