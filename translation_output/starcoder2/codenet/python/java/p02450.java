# Alphabet Rangoli

You are given an integer, . Your task is to print an alphabet rangoli of size . (Rangoli is a form of Indian folk art based on creation of patterns.)

Different sizes of alphabet rangoli are shown below:

#size 3

----c----
--c-b-c--
c-b-a-b-c
--c-b-c--
----c----

#size 5

--------e--------
------e-d-e------
----e-d-c-d-e----
--e-d-c-b-c-d-e--
e-d-c-b-a-b-c-d-e
--e-d-c-b-c-d-e--
----e-d-c-d-e----
------e-d-e------
--------e--------

#size 10

The center of the rangoli has the first alphabet letter a, and the boundary has the  alphabet letter (in alphabetical order).

Input Format

Only one line of input containing , the size of the rangoli.

Constraints

Output Format

Print the alphabet rangoli in the format explained above.

# Capitalize!

You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports. For example, alison heck should be capitalised correctly as .

Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately.

Input Format

A single line of input containing the full name, .

Constraints

The string consists of alphanumeric characters and spaces.
Note: in a word only the first character is capitalized. Example 12abc when capitalized remains 12abc.

Output Format

Print the capitalized string, .

# Merge the Tools!

Consider the following:

A string, , of length  where .
An integer, , where  is a factor of .
We can split  into  subsegments where each subsegment, , consists of a contiguous block of  characters in . Then, use each  to create string  such that:

The characters in  are a subsequence of the characters in .
Any repeat occurrence of a character is removed from the string such that each character in  occurs exactly once. In other words, if the character at some index  in  occurs at a previous index  in , then do not include the character in string .
Given  and , print  lines where each line  denotes string .

Input Format

The first line contains a single string denoting .
The second line contains an integer, , denoting the length of each subsegment.

Constraints
