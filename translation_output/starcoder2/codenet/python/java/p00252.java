## Course Outline

The course is divided into 10 modules, each covering a different topic. Here is a brief overview of each module:

1. Introduction to Programming: This module introduces the basics of programming, including variables, loops, and conditionals.

2. Arrays and Strings: This module covers the use of arrays and strings in Java.

3. Methods and Classes: This module introduces the concept of methods and classes, and how they are used to organize code.

4. Inheritance and Polymorphism: This module covers the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism, which are important features of object-oriented programming.

5. Exceptions and Error Handling: This module covers the use of exceptions and error handling in Java.

6. Collections and Generics: This module introduces the use of collections and generics, which are powerful features of the Java language.

7. Input and Output: This module covers the use of input and output in Java, including reading from and writing to files.

8. Multithreading: This module covers the use of multithreading in Java, which allows for the concurrent execution of multiple tasks.
