<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
1 20

Expected output:
Ciel


```
x , y = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
CielWon = False
while ( y > 1 and x * 10 + y > 21 ) :
    t = min ( x , 2 )
    x -= t
    y -= ( 2 - t ) * 10 + 2
    if ( y < 2 or 10 * x + y < 22 ) :
        CielWon = True
        break
    y -= 2
    t = min ( 2 , y // 10 )
    y -= 10 * t
    x -= 2 - t
print ( ' Ciel ' if CielWon else ' Hanako ' )


```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        int y = scanner.nextInt();
        boolean cielWon = false;
        while (y > 1 && x * 10 + y > 21) {
            int t = Math.min(x, 2);
            x -= t;
            y -= (2 - t) * 10 + 2;
            if (y < 2 || 10 * x + y < 22) {
                cielWon = true;
                break;
            }
            y -= 2;
            t = Math.min(2, y / 10);
            y -= 10 * t;
            x -= 2 - t;
        }
        System.out.println(cielWon ? "Ciel" : "Hanako");
    }
}
```

This Java code does exactly the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the input, and then it simulates the game until one of the players wins. The game is won by the player who can reduce the number of stones to 1 or less. The player who starts the game can take either 1 or 2 stones from the pile, and can also take up to 10 more stones if the pile has at least 10 more stones than the number of stones already taken. The player who takes the last stone wins the game.
