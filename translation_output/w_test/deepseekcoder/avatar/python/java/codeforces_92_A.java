<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
24 7440

Expected output:
9


```
import sys
input = sys . stdin . readline
n , m = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
i = 0
while True :
    if i + 1 > m :
        ans = m
        break
    m -= i + 1
    i += 1
    i %= n
print ( ans )


```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of your Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = scanner.nextInt();
        int i = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        while (true) {
            if (i + 1 > m) {
                ans = m;
                break;
            }
            m -= i + 1;
            i += 1;
            i %= n;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as your Python code. It reads two integers from the standard input, then it subtracts the sum of the numbers from 1 to `i + 1` (inclusive) from `m` until `m` is less than `i + 1`. After that, it prints the final value of `m`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 and then it is reset to 0 if it is equal to `n`.
