<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
-1000000000 -1

Expected output:
Positive


```
a , b = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
if a <= 0 and 0 <= b :
    print ( " Zero " )
elif a < 0 and min ( b - a , - a ) % 2 == 0 :
    print ( " Negative " )
else :
    print ( " Positive " )


```

### Response:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        if (a <= 0 && 0 <= b) {
            System.out.println("Zero");
        } else if (a < 0 && Math.min(b - a, -a) % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Negative");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Positive");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code reads two integers from the standard input, and then checks the conditions in the Python code to determine whether the first integer is less than or equal to zero and the second integer is between zero and the first integer, or if the first integer is negative and the absolute difference between the two integers and the absolute value of the first integer is even. It then prints the corresponding string to the standard output.
