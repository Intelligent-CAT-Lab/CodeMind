<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
4 12

Expected output:
16


```
x,y=map(int,input().split())
if y%x ==0:
  print(x+y)
else:
  print(y-x)
```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        int y = scanner.nextInt();
        if (y % x == 0) {
            System.out.println(x + y);
        } else {
            System.out.println(y - x);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the input, checks if the second integer is a multiple of the first one, and prints the sum or the difference accordingly.
