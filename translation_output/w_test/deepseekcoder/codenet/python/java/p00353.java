<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
1000 3000 3000

Expected output:
2000


```
m,f,b =map(int, input().split())
if m+f<b:
  print("NA")
elif m>=b:
  print("0")
else:
  print(b-m)

```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int m = scanner.nextInt();
        int f = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        if (m + f < b) {
            System.out.println("NA");
        } else if (m >= b) {
            System.out.println("0");
        } else {
            System.out.println(b - m);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads three integers from the input, checks if the sum of the first two is less than the third, and prints "NA" if it is. If the first integer is greater or equal to the third, it prints "0". Otherwise, it prints the difference between the third and the first.
