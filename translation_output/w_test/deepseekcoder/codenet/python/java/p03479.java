<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
3 20

Expected output:
3


```
 #a = 314159265
#b = 358979323846264338
a, b = map(int, input().split())
count = 1
x = a
#print(x)
while x * 2 <= b:
    x = x * 2
    #print(x)
    count += 1
print(count)
```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        long b = scanner.nextLong();
        int count = 1;
        long x = a;
        while (x * 2 <= b) {
            x = x * 2;
            count += 1;
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the input, initializes a counter to 1, and a variable `x` to the value of `a`. Then it enters a loop where it doubles `x` and increments the counter until `x` is greater than `b`. Finally, it prints the counter.
