```python

import sys

class Node:
    def __init__(self, to, cost):
        self.to = to
        self.cost = cost

    dp = [sys.maxsize] * K
    dp[0] = 0
    que = []
    for i in range(1, min(10, K)):
        dp[i] = i
        heapq.heappush(que, Node(i, i))
    while que:
        node = heapq.heappop(que)
        v = node.to
        c = node.cost
        if c > dp[v]:
            continue
        for i in range(10):
            nextv = (v * 10 + i) % K
            nextc = c + i
            if dp[nextv] > nextc:
                dp[nextv] = nextc
                heapq.heappush(que, Node(nextv, nextc))
    return dp[0]

K = int(input())
print(dijkstra(K))
```

Explanation:

We can use the same approach as the given java code, but we need to modify it to work with Python. We will use a priority queue to keep track of the nodes with the lowest cost. We will also use a list to keep track of the distances from the source node to all other nodes.

We will start by initializing the distance array `dp` to `sys.maxsize` and setting the distance from the source node to itself to 0. We will also create an empty priority queue `que`.

We will then add the first `min(10, K)` nodes to the priority queue and their distances to the distance array. We will use the formula `(v*10+i)%K` to calculate the next node in the sequence.

We will then enter a loop that continues until the priority queue is empty. In each iteration, we will remove the node with the lowest cost from the priority queue and its distance from the distance array. We will then add the neighbors of the current node to the priority queue if their distance is lower than the current distance in the distance array. We will use the formula `c+i` to calculate the distance of the neighbor.

Finally, we will return the distance from the source node to the destination node, which is `dp[0]`.<|endoftext|>
