import math

def count_digit(n):
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        count += 1
        n //= 10
    return count

def count_ways(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        head = int(str(i)[0])
        tail = i % 10
        if tail == 0:
            continue
        count += count_ways(tail)
    return count

n = int(input())
keta = count_digit(n)
result = count_ways(n)
print(result)

Explanation:

The given code is a Java program that counts the number of ways to write a number as a sum of powers of 10. The program reads an integer `n` from the user and then uses a two-dimensional array to count the number of times each digit appears in the number. The program then iterates through all the numbers from 1 to `n` and counts the number of times each digit appears in the number. Finally, it prints the total count of ways to write `n` as a sum of powers of 10.

In Python, we can implement the same logic using a recursive function `count_ways(n)` that counts the number of ways to write a number as a sum of powers of 10. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of ways to write `n` as a sum of powers of 10. The function first checks if `n` is 0 or 1, in which case there is only one way to write `n` as a sum of powers of 10. If `n` is greater than 1, the function recursively calls itself with `n-1` and adds the count of ways to write `n-1` as a sum of powers of 10 to the count of ways to write `n` as a sum of powers of 10.

The `count_digit(n)` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of digits in `n`. The function uses a while loop to count the number of digits in `n` by dividing `n` by 10 repeatedly until `n` becomes 0.

In the main program, we first read an integer `n` from the user using the `input()` function. We then call the `count_digit(n)` function to get the number of digits in `n`. We also call the `count_ways(n)` function to get the count of ways to write `n` as a sum of powers of 10. Finally, we print the count of ways to write `n` as a sum of powers of 10.<|endoftext|>
