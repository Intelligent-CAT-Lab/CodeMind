Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
87 34

Expected output:
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 

```
n , m = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
q = n // m
r = n % m
a = [ q ] * m
for i in range ( r ) :
    a [ i ] += 1
for i in range ( m ) :
    print ( a [ i ] , end = ' â ' )


```

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = scanner.nextInt();
        int q = n / m;
        int r = n % m;
        int[] a = new int[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            a[i] = q;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            a[i]++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            System.out.print(a[i] + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:

* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer from the user.
* The `split()` method is used to split the input string into two integers.
* The `map()` method is used to convert the input strings to integers.
* The `q` variable is used to store the quotient of `n` and `m`.
* The `r` variable is used to store the remainder of `n` and `m`.
* The `a` array is used to store the result of the division.
* The `for` loop is used to iterate over the `a` array and print the elements.
* The `end` parameter of the `print()` method is used to specify the separator between the elements.

Note: The `end` parameter is only available in Java 11 and later versions. In earlier versions, you can use the `System.out.println()` method to print the elements with a newline character at the end.</s>
