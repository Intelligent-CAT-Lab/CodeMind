Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
75 25

Expected output:
25


```
A , B = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
ans = A - 2 * B
if ans < 0 :
    ans = 0
print ( ans )


```
[/INST]
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        int ans = A - 2 * B;
        if (ans < 0) {
            ans = 0;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer from the user.
* The `split()` method is used to split the input string into two parts, separated by a space.
* The `map()` method is used to convert the two parts of the input string into integers.
* The `ans` variable is calculated by subtracting 2 times the second integer from the first integer.
* If the result is negative, the `ans` variable is set to 0.
* The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the result to the console.</s>
