Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
7 5 1

Expected output:
YES


```
a, b, c = list(map(int, input().split()))

def foo(a, b, c):
    seen = set()
    m = a % b
    i = m
    while i not in seen :
        if i == c:
            print("YES")
            return 
        seen.add(i)
        i = (m + i) % b
    print("NO")
foo(a, b, c)

```

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        sc.close();

        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        int m = a % b;
        int i = m;
        while (!seen.contains(i)) {
            if (i == c) {
                System.out.println("YES");
                return;
            }
            seen.add(i);
            i = (m + i) % b;
        }
        System.out.println("NO");
    }
}
```
This is a Java implementation of the provided Python code. It uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `Set` and `HashSet` classes to keep track of the numbers that have been seen. The `while` loop continues until the `i` variable is found in the `seen` set, or until the `i` variable is equal to `c`. If `i` is equal to `c`, the program prints "YES" and returns. Otherwise, it prints "NO" and exits.</s>
