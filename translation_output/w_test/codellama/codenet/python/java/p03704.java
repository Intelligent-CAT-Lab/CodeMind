This code uses the `Scanner` class to read the input from the user, and then it uses a for loop to iterate over the range of values from 1 to 20, and for each value it calls the `f` function with the input value and 0 as the second and third arguments, and then it multiplies the result by 10 - i % 2 * 9, where i is the current value in the loop, and then it adds the result to the final result.

The `f` function is a recursive function that takes three arguments: `d`, `x`, and `y`. It first calculates the value of `n` as the product of 9 repeated `x` times and 0 repeated `y` times, and then it checks if `d` is equal to 0 and `x` is less than 1, in which case it returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the result of calling `f` recursively with the arguments `d + i * n`, `x - 2`, and `y + 1` for each value of `i` from -9 to 9, and then it multiplies the result by 10 - `Math.abs(i)` - (y < 1), where `i` is the current value in the loop, and then it returns the sum.

The `Math.abs` function is used to get the absolute value of `i`, and the `Math.abs(i) < n` check is used to avoid overflow errors.

The `repeat` method is used to repeat the string "9" `x` times and "0" `y` times, and then it converts the resulting string to an integer using the `Integer.parseInt` method.

The `Math.abs` method is used to get the absolute value of `i`, and the `Math.abs(i) < n` check is used to avoid overflow errors.

The `Math.abs(i) - (y < 1)` check is used to avoid overflow errors, and it ensures that the result is always between 0 and 9.

The `Math.abs(i) - (y < 1)` check is used to avoid overflow errors, and it ensures that the result is always between 0 and 9.
