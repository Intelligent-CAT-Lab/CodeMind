Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
2

Expected output:
1


```
n = int(input())
print((n+1) &- (n+1))
```
[/INST]
```java
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        System.out.println((n+1) &- (n+1));
    }
}
```
This code takes an integer `n` as input and prints the result of the expression `(n+1) &- (n+1)`. The `&-` operator is a bitwise AND operator that performs a bitwise AND operation on the two operands and then negates the result.

In this case, the expression `(n+1) &- (n+1)` is equivalent to `n &- n`, which is equivalent to `n &- 0`, which is equivalent to `n`. Therefore, the output of the program will be `n`.

Here's an example of how the program works:

* If the input is `2`, then `n` will be `2`, and the expression `(n+1) &- (n+1)` will be evaluated as `2 &- 2`, which is `0`.
* If the input is `3`, then `n` will be `3`, and the expression `(n+1) &- (n+1)` will be evaluated as `3 &- 3`, which is `0`.

Therefore, the output of the program will always be `0`, regardless of the input.</s>
