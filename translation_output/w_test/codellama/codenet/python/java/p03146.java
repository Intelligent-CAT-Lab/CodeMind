This is a solution to the problem in Java. It uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `HashSet` class to keep track of the numbers that have been seen before. The `Deque` class is not used in this solution.

The `solve` method takes an integer `s` as input, and it uses a while loop to iterate until the number `pre` reaches 1. At each iteration, it checks if `pre` is even or odd, and it updates `pre` accordingly. It also checks if `pre` has been seen before, and if it has, it prints the number of iterations it took to reach `pre` and returns. If `pre` has not been seen before, it adds it to the set of seen numbers and continues the loop.

The `main` method simply reads an integer `s` from the user and calls the `solve` method with that input.</s>
