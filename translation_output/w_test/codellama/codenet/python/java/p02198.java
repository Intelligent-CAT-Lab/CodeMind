Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
3 4

Expected output:
12


```
N,M=map(int,input().split())
print(N*M)

```
[/INST]
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int M = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(N * M);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* The `import` statement is used to import the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package.
* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer from the user.
* The `print()` method is used to print the result to the console.

Note: The `map()` function is not available in Java, so we need to use the `Scanner` class to read the input and the `print()` method to print the result.</s>
