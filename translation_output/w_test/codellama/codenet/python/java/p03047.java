Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
3 2

Expected output:
2


```
N,K = map(int,input().split())

print(N-(K-1))
```
[/INST]
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int K = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(N - (K - 1));
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer from the user.
* The `split()` method is used to split the input string into two parts, separated by a space.
* The `map()` method is used to convert the two parts of the input string into integers.
* The `print()` method is used to print the result to the console.

Note: The `map()` method is not necessary in this case, as the input is already in the correct format. However, it is a good practice to use `map()` when working with user input to ensure that the input is in the correct format.</s>
