Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
3

Expected output:
2


```
import java.util.*;

public class p01998 {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		boolean[] arr = new boolean[n + 3];
		arr[0] = true;
		arr[1] = true;
		int count = 0;
		for (int i = 2; i < arr.length; i++) {
		    if (!arr[i]) {
		        for (int j = 2; j * i < arr.length; j++) {
		            arr[i * j]  = true;
		        }
		        if (!arr[i] && !arr[i - 2]) {
		            count++;
		        }
		    }
		}
		System.out.println(count * 2);
	}
}

Here is the Python code that solves the problem:
```python
import sys

n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
arr = [False] * (n + 3)
arr[0] = True
arr[1] = True
count = 0

for i in range(2, len(arr)):
    if not arr[i]:
        for j in range(2, int(len(arr) / i)):
            arr[i * j] = True
        if not arr[i] and not arr[i - 2]:
            count += 1

print(count * 2)
```
This code uses the same logic as the Java code, but it is written in Python. It reads the input from stdin, creates an array of booleans to represent the numbers, and then loops through the array to mark the multiples of each number as true. Finally, it prints the number of pairs of prime numbers that can be formed.

Note that the Python code uses the `sys` module to read the input from stdin, and the `range` function to loop through the array. It also uses the `int` function to convert the input from a string to an integer.</s>
