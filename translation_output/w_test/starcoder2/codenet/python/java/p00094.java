# Introduction

## What is programming?

Programming is the process of writing a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a computer?

A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.

## What is a program?

A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. A computer requires programs to function.

## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

## What is a compiler?

A compiler is a computer program that transforms computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language).

## What is an interpreter?

An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. performs, instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into a machine language program.

## What is an IDE?

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Most modern IDEs have intelligent code completion. Some IDEs contain a compiler, interpreter, or both.

## What is a text editor?

A text editor is a type of program used to edit plain text files. It is a form of an word processor.

## What is a terminal?

A terminal is a text-based interface to a computer. It is a program that accepts text input to the computer and returns text output from the computer.

## What is a shell?

A shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation.

## What is a command-line interface?

A command-line interface (CLI) is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines).

## What is a graphical user interface?

A graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.

## What is a command?

A command is a sequence of characters that is entered into a computer operating system or a computer program to request a service.

## What is a flag?

A flag is a command-line option that modifies the behavior of another command, program, or operating system feature in a computer program.

## What is a parameter?

A parameter is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine.

## What is a variable?

A variable is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity or information.

## What is a data type?

A data type is a classification identifying one of various types of data, such as real, integer, or Boolean, that determines the possible values for that type; the operations that can be done on values of that type; the meaning of the data; and the way values of that type can be stored.

## What is a function?

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.

## What is a library?

A library is a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, often for software development. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, pre-written code and subroutines, classes, values or type specifications.

## What is a package?

A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. Conceptually you can think of packages as being similar to different folders on your computer. You might keep HTML files in one folder, images in another, and scripts or applications in yet another. For the same reason, it is very useful to keep Java classes in packages that correspond to their location on the computer's file system.

## What is an object?

An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life.

## What is a class?

A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. A class is a template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object.

## What is an instance?

An instance is a specific realization of any object.

## What is an object-oriented programming language?

An object-oriented programming language (OOPL) is a high-level programming language based on the object-oriented model. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.

## What is a class diagram?

A class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.

## What is an object diagram?

An object diagram is a type of static structure diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that shows the objects in a system at a point in time.

## What is a sequence diagram?

A sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order. It is a form of communication diagram.

## What is a collaboration diagram?

A collaboration diagram is a diagram that shows how objects interact with one another. It is a form of communication diagram.

## What is a use case diagram?

A use case diagram is a type of behavior diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that shows the functionalities offered by a system.

## What is a state machine diagram?

A state machine diagram is a type of behavior diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that shows how a system or object reacts to a set of possible events.

## What is a component diagram?

A component diagram is a type of structure diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that shows the physical structure of a system by showing the system's components and their relationships.

## What is a deployment diagram?

A deployment diagram is a type of structure diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that shows the physical structure of a system by showing the system's components and their relationships.

## What is a package diagram?

A package diagram is a type of structure
