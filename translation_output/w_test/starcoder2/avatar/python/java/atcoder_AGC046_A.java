# Introduction

## What is programming?

Programming is the process of writing a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a computer program?

A computer program is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a computer?

A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.

## What is a computer language?

A computer language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer.

## What is a compiler?

A compiler is a computer program that transforms computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language).

## What is an interpreter?

An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. performs, instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into a machine language program.

## What is a script?

A script is a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

## What is a script language?

A script language is a programming language for a script.

## What is a high-level programming language?

A high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer.

## What is a low-level programming language?

A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture—commands or functions in the language map closely to processor instructions.

## What is an assembly language?

An assembly language is a low-level programming language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (generally one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.

## What is a machine code?

Machine code is the set of instructions that can be directly executed by the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer.

## What is an object code?

Object code is a form of machine code that is not directly executable by the CPU of a computer.

## What is a bytecode?

Bytecode is a form of machine code that is not directly executable by the CPU of a computer.

## What is a programming paradigm?

A programming paradigm is a style or "way" of programming.

## What is a procedural programming?

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.

## What is a functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data.

## What is a logical programming?

Logical programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as deduction.

## What is an object-oriented programming?

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.

## What is a declarative programming?

Declarative programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

## What is a structured programming?

Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of subroutines, block structures, for and while loops—in contrast to using simple tests and jumps such as the go to statement, which could lead to "spaghetti code" that is difficult to follow and maintain.

## What is an imperative programming?

Imperative programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that describes computation in terms of statements that change a program state.

## What is a concurrent programming?

Concurrent programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that deals with the organization of computer programs, algorithms, and data structures into tasks that can be executed concurrently.

## What is a parallel programming?

Parallel programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that exploits the inherent parallelism of the problem to produce a much faster and efficient solution.

## What is a distributed programming?

Distributed programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that focuses on the distribution of the program's execution across multiple processes, computers, or other computing elements, with the purpose of improving performance and availability through redundancy.

## What is a concurrent programming?

Concurrent programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that deals with the organization of computer programs, algorithms, and data structures into tasks that can be executed concurrently.

## What is a parallel programming?

Parallel programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that exploits the inherent parallelism of the problem to produce a much faster and efficient solution.
