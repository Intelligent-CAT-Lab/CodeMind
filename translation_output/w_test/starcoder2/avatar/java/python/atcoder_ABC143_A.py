Expected output:
Yes

```
import java.util.*;

public class atcoder_ABC143_B {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        int C = sc.nextInt();
        if A + B + C >= 22:
            system.out.println("Yes")
        else:
            system.out.println("No")
    }
}
```

python code:
```python
A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
if A + B + C >= 22:
