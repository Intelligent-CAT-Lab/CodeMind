Here's the translated Java code with a sample test case:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        int C = scanner.nextInt();

        int get = A - B;
        int i = C - get;

        if (i < 0) {
            i = 0;
        }

        System.out.println(i);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This Java program will read three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` from the standard input (test input `6 4 3`), perform the same calculations as the Python code, and then print the expected output (`1`), which you can run and test in a Java environment.
