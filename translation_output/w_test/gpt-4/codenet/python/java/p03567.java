Here's the requested Python code translated into Java:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = scanner.next();

        if (S.contains("AC")) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}
```

For your test input of "BACD," running this Java code would print "Yes" to the console, as expected.
