Below is the translated Java code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.HashSet;

class Main {

    // The 'solve' method to find the sequence length.
    public static void solve(int s) {
        int m = 1;
        long pre = s;
        Set<Long> st = new HashSet<>();
        st.add(pre);

        while (true) {
            m += 1;
            if (pre % 2 == 0) {
                pre /= 2;
            } else {
                pre = 3 * pre + 1;
            }

            if (st.contains(pre)) {
                System.out.println(m);
                return;
            }
            st.add(pre);
        }
    }

    // The 'main' method reads the input number and calls the 'solve' method.
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int s = scanner.nextInt();
        solve(s);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This Java program includes the `main` method that reads an integer from the standard input, just like the original Python code does with the `sys.stdin.readline()` function. The `solve` method does the primary computation to find the correct sequence length, using a HashSet to store already-seen values as the original Python code does with a set.

To test this Java code, you would need to compile and run it with an input of `8` on your system, and it should output `5` as expected.
