Below is the translated code in Java with a main method that expects standard input to receive two integers separated by a space, similar to the Python sample you've provided. It calculates and outputs the result according to the logic in your Python script.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DifferenceCalculation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        int diff = A - B * 2;

        if (diff < 0) {
            System.out.println(0);
        } else {
            System.out.println(diff);
        }
    }
}
```

In a real-case scenario, you'd compile and run this Java program with a Java compiler, and it would wait for an input. You'd then provide "12 4" as the input followed by pressing Enter, and it should output "4", just as expected from the provided test case.
