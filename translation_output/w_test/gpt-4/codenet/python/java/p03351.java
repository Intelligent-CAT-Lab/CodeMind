Certainly! Here's the equivalent code in Java:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();

        boolean condition = Math.abs(a - c) <= d || (Math.abs(a - b) <= d && Math.abs(b - c) <= d);
        System.out.println(condition ? "Yes" : "No");

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This Java code will read four integers as input and output "Yes" if the condition `abs(a-c)<=d or (abs(a-b)<=d and abs(b-c)<=d)` holds true and "No" if it doesn't. 

The original Python code uses a string slicing trick to select "Yes" or "No" by checking if the condition is not true. Java lacks a direct equivalent of this Python string slicing technique, so an explicit if-else (or ternary operator in this case) is used instead.
