Here is the translated code from Python to Java:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int s = 180 * (n - 2);
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```

To use this Java program, compile it and run it, then input the number `3` or any other integer value when prompted. The program will then output the expected result. 

For the sample test input of `3`, the expected output will be `180`, as specified.
