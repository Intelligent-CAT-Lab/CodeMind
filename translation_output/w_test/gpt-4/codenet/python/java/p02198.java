Below is the translated code from Python to Java that will achieve the same functionality:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int M = scanner.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println(N * M);
    }
}
```

When you run this Java program and input "3 4," it will print out "12" as expected.
