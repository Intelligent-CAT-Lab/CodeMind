Certainly! Below is the Java code translated into Python:

```python
# Taking input
s = input()

# Printing 'x' for each character in the string
for i in range(len(s)):
    print('x', end='')

# Alternatively, you can achieve the same result with a more Pythonic approach:
# print('x' * len(s))
```

When you run this Python code and input "sardine", the expected output will be "xxxxxxx".
