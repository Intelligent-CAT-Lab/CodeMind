Here's the Java code translated into Python:

```python
# Get input from user
n = input()

# Check if '7' is in the string representation of the number and print result
print("Yes" if '7' in n else "No")
```

To run a simple test case with the input `117`, you would do the following:

```python
n = '117'  # Sample test input
print("Yes" if '7' in n else "No")  # Expected output: Yes
```
