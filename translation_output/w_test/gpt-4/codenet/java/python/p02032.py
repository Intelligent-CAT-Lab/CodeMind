Here's the Python version of the provided Java code:

```python
import sys

def main():
    n = int(input())
    pf = dict()
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        c = 0
        while n % i == 0:
            n //= i
            c += 1
        if c > 0:
            pf[i] = c
        i += 1
    if n > 1:
        pf[n] = 1

    ans = 1
    for value in pf.values():
        ans *= (value + 1)
    print(len(pf), ans - 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python script essentially performs the same functionality as the original Java code doing the following steps:
1. It reads an integer `n` from the standard input.
2. It calculates the prime factorization of `n` and stores the prime factors with their respective powers in a dictionary named `pf`.
3. It calculates the answer as the product of powers incremented by one, following by `ans - 1`.
4. Finally, it prints out the number of distinct prime factors (the length of the dictionary `pf`) and the calculated `ans - 1`.

You can run the Python code with a test input like this:
```
echo "18" | python3 divisors.py
```

And you would expect to see the output:
```
2 5
```

Remember to replace `divisors.py` with the name of the file that you saved your Python script as.
