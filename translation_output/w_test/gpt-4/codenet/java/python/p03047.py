Here is the equivalent Python code for the given Java program:

```python
# Reading input from user
n, k = map(int, input().split())

# Calculating and printing the result
print(n - k + 1)
```

If you want to test it with the sample input provided ("3 2"), you can run the code and type `3 2` in the console followed by pressing Enter. The expected output ("2") will be printed on the screen.
