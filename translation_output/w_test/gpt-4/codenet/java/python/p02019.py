Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
# Read input from user
input_data = input().split()  # Split the input string by spaces

# Parse input to integers
n, a, b, c = map(int, input_data)  # Map the split string inputs to integers

# Print the result
print(n - a - b + c)
```

This Python script serves the same functionality as the provided Java code. It reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts them to integers, and prints the calculated result.
