Here is the equivalent Python code for the Java code provided:

```python
x, y = map(int, input().split())  # Get two integers from the input

crane = -(y / 2) + 2 * x
turtle = x - crane

# Check if the calculated number of cranes and turtles is valid
# The number must be non-negative and a whole number (integer)
if turtle < 0 or crane < 0 or turtle % 1 != 0 or crane % 1 != 0:
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")
```

This Python solution takes two space-separated integers from the standard input, and prints out "Yes" if the number of cranes and turtles can be exactly determined to match the inputs; "No" otherwise. Python has dynamic typing and therefore it isn't necessary to import types or to use a scanner object. Input handling is significantly more straightforward compared to Java.
