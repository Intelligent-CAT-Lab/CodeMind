Here's the Python equivalent of the given Java code:

```python
import math

def execute(input_val):
    r = int(math.sqrt(input_val))
    return r * r

# Example/test case
input_val = 10
output_val = execute(input_val)
print(output_val)
```

To run the test case as outlined, you would call the script with an argument of `10`, which should provide you the expected output of `9`.
