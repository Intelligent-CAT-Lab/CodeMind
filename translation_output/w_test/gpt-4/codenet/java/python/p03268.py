Here's the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())

    num = [0] * k

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        num[i % k] += 1

    res = 0
    for a in range(k):
        b = (k - a) % k
        c = b  # This line is directly from Java code. In Java, b and c will be the same due to integer division.
        if (b + c) % k != 0:
            continue
        res += num[a] * num[b] * num[c]

    print(res)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now, to run a sample test case. If your input is `3 2`, you can use the following:

```python
# Sample Test Case
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # included a simulated input function for testing purposes
    input = lambda: '3 2'
    main()
```

The expected output, as per the test case provided, would be `9`. When using a terminal or a scripting environment, replace the `input` lambda function with the standard `input()` function to accept real user input.

Remember that in Python, indentation is used to define blocks of code. Make sure when implementing this solution that your indentation is consistent, using either spaces or tabs, and that your blocks are correctly indented according to Python syntax standards.
