Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code. Note that in Python, you'd typically not need to use classes and methods in such a procedural style, but I've kept the structure similar to maintain the logic flow.

```python
class Task:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mod = 998244353

    def solve(self, cc):
        n = len(cc)
        r = 0
        b = 0
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1
        for i in range(n):
            if cc[i] == '0':
                r += 2
            elif cc[i] == '1':
                r += 1
                b += 1
            else:
                b += 2
            for prevUseRed in range(i + 1):
                if prevUseRed + 1 <= r:
                    dp[i + 1][prevUseRed + 1] += dp[i][prevUseRed]
                    dp[i + 1][prevUseRed + 1] %= self.mod
                prevUseBlue = i - prevUseRed
                if prevUseBlue + 1 <= b:
                    dp[i + 1][prevUseRed] += dp[i][prevUseRed]
                    dp[i + 1][prevUseRed] %= self.mod
        combin = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in range(n + 1):
            combin[i][0] = combin[i][i] = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, i):
                combin[i][j] = (combin[i - 1][j - 1] + combin[i - 1][j]) % self.mod
        tto = 0
        for i in range(min(r, n) + 1):
            ways = dp[n][i]
            lr = r - i
            lb = b - (n - i)
            if lb < 0:
                continue
            ways *= combin[n][lr]
            ways %= self.mod
            tto = (tto + ways) % self.mod
        return tto


# Here I'm just using a simple input method for testing
# assuming 'input_string' is a string containing the input
def main():
    input_string = input("Enter a number string: ")
    t = Task()
    result = t.solve(input_string)
    print(result)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When you run the code and input "02" when prompted, it should print "3" as expected.

In Python, we don't need the PrintWriter, Scanner, or other utility classes from Java's I/O framework; Python's built-in file handling and input/output are typically more straightforward and less verbose. I've also omitted the code used for memory and time tracking, as these are not common practices in Python scripting for such simple cases, and are usually done using different tools when necessary.
