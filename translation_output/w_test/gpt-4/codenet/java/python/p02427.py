Below is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code snippet. The code reads one integer from the standard input, which represents the number `n`, and then prints out the required sequence based on the bitwise representation of numbers from 0 to `2^n - 1`.

```python
n = int(input())

for i in range(2 ** n):
    temp = i
    print(f"{i}:", end="")
    j = 0
    while temp > 0:
        if temp % 2 == 1:
            print(f" {j}", end="")
        temp //= 2
        j += 1
    print()
```

Here's the provided test case executed with the above code:

Test input:
```
4
```

Expected output:
```
0:
1: 0
2: 1
3: 0 1
4: 2
5: 0 2
6: 1 2
7: 0 1 2
8: 3
9: 0 3
10: 1 3
11: 0 1 3
12: 2 3
13: 0 2 3
14: 1 2 3
15: 0 1 2 3
```
