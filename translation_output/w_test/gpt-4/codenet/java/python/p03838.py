Below is the translated Python version of the provided Java code:

```python
import sys

class p03838:
    def solve(self, x, y):
        if x >= 0:
            if y >= 0:
                if x > y:
                    if y == 0:
                        print(x - y + 1)
                    else:
                        print(x - y + 2)
                else:
                    print(y - x)
            else:
                print(abs(abs(y) - x) + 1)
        else:
            if y >= 0:
                if y == 0:
                    print(abs(abs(x) - y))
                else:
                    print(abs(abs(x) - y) + 1)
            else:
                if x > y:
                    print(x - y + 2)
                else:
                    print(y - x)

def main():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    solver = p03838()
    solver.solve(x, y)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code will work similarly to the provided Java code. We no longer need the input reading methods from the Java code such as `nextInt()`, `nextLong()`, `nextDouble()`, etc. since Python's built-in functions (`input()` and `split()`) are more straightforward for reading from stdin. Also, Python doesn't need the PrintWriter and the elaborate input buffering used in the Java example, so those parts are excluded.
