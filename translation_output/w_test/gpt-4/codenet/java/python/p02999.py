Below is the translated Python code:

```python
# Read integers from input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Determine and print the result based on the condition
if a < b:
    print(0)
else:
    print(10)
```

Now, let's use the provided test case to check the output:

Test input:
```
3 5
```

Expected output:
```
0
```

To run the test case, you would call the Python executable with the script saved as a `.py` file, or you could just run this in an interactive Python session or any Python IDE. After running, input `3 5` and press Enter, it should output `0`.
