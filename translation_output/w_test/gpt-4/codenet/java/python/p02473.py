Here's the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
from sys import stdin

# Read input
a, b = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
# Subtract b from a
result = a - b
# Print the result
print(result)
```

You can test the above Python code with the given test input:

Test input (assuming you provide it through stdin or a text file):
```
5 8
```

Expected output:
```
-3
```
