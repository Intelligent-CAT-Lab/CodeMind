Here is the translated Python code for the Java program provided:

```python
def main():
    numbers = input().split()
    result = (int(numbers[0]) + int(numbers[1])) // 2
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

If you run this Python code with the input "1000 3000", it would output the expected result of "2000".
