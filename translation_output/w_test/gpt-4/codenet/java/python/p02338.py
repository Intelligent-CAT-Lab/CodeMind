Here's the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
import sys

def main():
    # Reads from stdin in Python, splits the input by whitespace, and converts to integers
    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

    # Outputting the result based on the comparison without the need for a custom scanner
    if n <= k:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This Python code can be used to process the given sample test case. It reads two integers from standard input and prints `1` if the first integer is less than or equal to the second, or `0` otherwise. The custom `FastScanner` class and threading code from the Java version aren't necessary in Python because Python's built-in functions for reading from standard input are already fairly efficient, and Python doesn't use the same threading model as Java to increase stack size.
