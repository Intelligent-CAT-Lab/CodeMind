The provided Java code demonstrates a lot of functionality, but to achieve the specific functionality of the expected test case—calculating the distance between minute and hour hands on a clock—we only need to translate a relevant subset of the code to Python.

Here's the Python code that corresponds to the main logic used for computing the distance between the two hands of the clock:

```python
import math

def solve(A, B, H, M):
    a_x = A * math.sin(math.pi * 2 * (H * 60 + M) / 720)
    b_x = B * math.sin(math.pi * 2 * M / 60)
    a_y = A * math.cos(math.pi * 2 * (H * 60 + M) / 720)
    b_y = B * math.cos(math.pi * 2 * M / 60)
    
    return math.sqrt((a_x - b_x) ** 2 + (a_y - b_y) ** 2)

# Test input
A = 3
B = 4
H = 9
M = 0

# Expected output
result = solve(A, B, H, M)
print("{:.20f}".format(result))
```
This will give the expected output for the provided test case:

```
5.00000000000000000000
```

Note that I've translated only the parts of the code that are necessary for solving the specific problem, as the original Java code contains a lot of classes and interfaces that are not utilized for this particular calculation.
