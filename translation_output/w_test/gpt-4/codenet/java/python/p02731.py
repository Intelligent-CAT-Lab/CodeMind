Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code. The Java code reads an integer input, divides it by 3, raises the result to the power of 3, and prints the result. Let's replicate that functionality in Python:

```python
# Get input from the user
L = int(input())

# Print the result of (L/3)^3 with a newline at the end
print(f"{(L / 3) ** 3:.12f}")
```

Given the test input "3", running this Python code will produce the expected output:

```
1.000000000000
```
