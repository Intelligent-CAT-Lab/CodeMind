Below is the equivalent Python code that matches the behavior of the Java code:

```python
a = int(input())
print((a - 30) // 2)
```

The `//` operator in Python is used for integer division, which is similar to the default `/` division operation in Java when used with integer types. The `input()` function in Python reads a line from input and returns it as a string, so it's necessary to cast it to an int with `int()`.
