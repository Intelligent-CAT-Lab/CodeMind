Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
def main():
    s = input()  # Read input from the user
    print('x' if s[0] == 'x' and s[-1] == 'x' else 'o')

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code will take an input string from the user, check if the first and last characters are both 'x', and print 'x' if they are, or 'o' otherwise.
