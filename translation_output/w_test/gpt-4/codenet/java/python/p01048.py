Here's the Java code translated to Python:

```python
def p01048():
    ans = [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 16, 12, 64, 24, 36, 48, 1024, 60]
    i = int(input())
    print(ans[i])

# Test the function with the provided test case
p01048()
```

When you run this Python function, it will expect a number as input (like the test input '1' provided) and will output the corresponding number from the `ans` list.
