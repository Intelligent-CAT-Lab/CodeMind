The given Java code uses a Stack to track rotations and determine the number of times a full 360Â° rotation (i.e., a circle) is made given a series of 'R' (right turn) and 'L' (left turn) commands. In Java, a Stack is a class from the `java.util` package, while in Python we can use a list to simulate stack behavior with `append` and `pop` methods.

Here's how you might translate the Java code into Python:

```python
# Test input:
# RRRRLLLLRRRR

# Expected output:
# 2

def count_circles(commands):
    # Initialize direction to North
    dir = 0

    # Initialize stack to track rotations
    stack = [0]
    result = 0

    for command in commands:
        # Calculate direction based on command
        if command == 'R':
            dir += 1
        else:
            dir += 3
        dir %= 4

        # When facing North, create a new stack if necessary
        if dir == 0 and not stack:
            stack = [0]
        elif stack:
            if command == 'L':
                stack.pop()
                if len(stack) == 0:
                    stack = []
            else:
                stack.append(0)
                if len(stack) == 5:
                    result += 1
                    stack.clear()
                    stack.append(0)
    return result

# Test the function with the provided input
test_input = "RRRRLLLLRRRR"
print(count_circles(test_input))
```

In this Python version, the Stack structure from Java is replaced by a simple list, and we check for stack emptiness by verifying the length of the list (e.g., `len(stack) == 0`). The print statement at the end prints the result of calling `count_circles` with the test input.
