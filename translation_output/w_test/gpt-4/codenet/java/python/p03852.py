Certainly! Here's the equivalent Python code for the given Java code:

```python
c = input()

if c in ('a', 'i', 'u', 'e', 'o'):
    print("vowel")
else:
    print("consonant")

# Test input
# a

# Expected output
# vowel
```

This Python code reads a character from the standard input just like the Java code, checks if the character is a vowel, and prints "vowel" or "consonant" accordingly.
