Here is the translated Python code:

```python
import math
import sys

def solve(r):
    pi = math.pi
    return 2 * pi * r

if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = 1  # or we could set t = int(input()) to take number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):
        r = float(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        result = solve(r)
        print(f"{result:.20f}")

# To run the test case you can perform this in the shell:
# echo "1" | python script_name.py
```

For the test case with the input "1", if you save the above code into a Python file, say `script_name.py`, you can run the test case in a shell with the following command:

```shell
echo "1" | python script_name.py
```

and the expected output would be:

```
6.28318530717958623200
```

Python's `sys.stdin.readline()` is used to read input from standard input (similar to Java's `InputStream`). Also, Python has the `math.pi` constant available in the `math` module, which is a close approximation of Ï€. The formatting `.20f` in the `print` statement is used to format the floating-point number to display 20 decimal places, similar to Java's default behavior with `PrintWriter.println`.
