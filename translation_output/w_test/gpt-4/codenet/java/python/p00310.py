Below is the Python translation of the given Java code. This Python code assumes that the input will be given in the same way as the test case, where the three integers are provided on a single line, separated by spaces.

```python
def main():
    # Read integers from input
    p, m, c = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Print the sum of the integers
    print(p + m + c)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can run this Python code and provide it with the test input "10 10 20" (without quotes) to get the expected output, which is 40.
