Here is the translated code in Python:

```python
a, t, r = map(int, input().split())
print(r * t / a)
```

This code snippet assumes that the inputs will be spaced by a space (as per given in the test input). It reads the input in one line, splits the string into individual numbers, converts them into integers, and then performs the same calculation as the Java code. Finally, it prints out the result.
