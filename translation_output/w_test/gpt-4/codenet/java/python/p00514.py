This Java code accepts three integer inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`, and computes a certain combinatorial result (it's essentially calculating the binomial coefficient). To translate this code into Python, we'll use Python's built-in libraries and syntax. We'll also simplify the combinatorial computation by using the `math.comb()` function available in Python 3.8 and later, which performs the binomial coefficient calculation directly.

Here's the translated Python code:

```python
from math import comb

# Read integer inputs from the user
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

# Check the first condition
if a * b > c:
    print(0)
    exit(0)

# Adjust c accordingly
c -= a * b
d = c + a - 1

# Calculate the combinatorial result using math.comb for the binomial coefficient
result = comb(d, c)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

Note that the Python `math.comb()` function simplifies the calculation significantly as compared to manually computing it using a `BigInteger` object in Java and performing the multiplication and division for each term.
