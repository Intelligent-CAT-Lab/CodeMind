The equivalent Python code using the `input()` function for reading from the standard input and the `abs()` function for computing the absolute value could look like this:

```python
def main():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    print(abs((N-2) * (M-2)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To use the code, you'd run it and input your `N` and `M` values separated by a space. For instance, inputting `2 2` should result in the output `0`, as expected from the provided test case.
