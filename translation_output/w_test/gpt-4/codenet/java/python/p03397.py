Below is the translated code from Java to Python. Note that in the absence of a direct equivalent to the `FastScanner` and `PrintWriter` classes in Python, the standard input and output are utilized through built-in functions in Python.

```python
def add(x, y, mod=(10**9 + 7)):
    x += y
    if x >= mod:
        x -= mod
    return x

def solve(s):
    go = [
        [0, 0], [2, 2], [1, 3], [2, 0], [5, 5], [4, 6],
        [5, 3], [8, 8], [7, 9], [8, 6]
    ]
    start = len(go) - 1
    win = "W?W?L?W?L?"
    states = len(win)
    dp = [0] * states
    dp[start] = 1
    ndp = [0] * states
    
    for c in s:
        ndp = [0] * states
        for st in range(states):
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                next_st = go[st][0]
                ndp[next_st] = add(ndp[next_st], dp[st])
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                next_st = go[st][1]
                ndp[next_st] = add(ndp[next_st], dp[st])
        dp, ndp = ndp, dp

    res = 0
    for i in range(states):
        if dp[i] == 0:
            continue
        w = win[i]
        if w == '?':
            raise AssertionError()
        if w == 'W':
            res += dp[i]
    
    return res % (10**9 + 7)

# Sample test case
input_data = "1??00"
print(solve(input_data))  # Expected output: 2
```

This Python function solves the same problem as the original Java code, while taking into account the differences in language syntax and standard libraries. The main logic of the algorithm is preserved across languages. The `solve` function takes the input string as an argument and outputs the result to the console.
