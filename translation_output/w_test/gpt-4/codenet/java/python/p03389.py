The Java code provided takes three integer inputs, calculates the maximum of these numbers, and then uses this to determine a particular outcome based on the parity of the sum of the input numbers and the maximum number's parity. It prints out the result, which represents the number of minimum moves required to make all three numbers equal, to the standard output. Here's the Python equivalent:

```python
A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
M = max(A, B, C)

if (A + B + C) % 2 == M % 2:
    print((3 * M - (A + B + C)) // 2)
else:
    print(((3 * M + 3) - (A + B + C)) // 2)
```

If you use the provided test case with the input `2 5 4`, the converted Python code will give you the expected output `2`.
