Here is the translated code in Python:

```python
# Reading inputs from user
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

# Checking the conditions
if (a == 5 and b == 7 and c == 5) or (a == 5 and b == 5 and c == 7) or (a == 7 and b == 5 and c == 5):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

Now let's try the sample test case you provided:

Test input: 
5 5 7

Expected output should be `YES` when you run the above Python code with the provided input.
