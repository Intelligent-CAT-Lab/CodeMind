Here's the Java code translated to Python. Please use the `sys.stdin.readline()` method to read the input:

```python
import sys

MOD = 1_000_000_007
inf = float('inf')

def solve(n, x, y, z):
    sum_values = x + y + z + 1
    mask = (1 << sum_values) - 1
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(mask + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    ng = (1 << z) | (1 << (y + z)) | (1 << (x + y + z))
    dp[0][1] = 1
    for i in range(n):
        for state in range(mask + 1):
            for j in range(1, 11):
                res = ((state << j) & mask) + 1
                if (res & ng) == ng:
                    continue
                dp[i + 1][res] += dp[i][state]
                dp[i + 1][res] %= MOD

    ans = pow(10, n, MOD)
    for i in range(mask + 1):
        ans -= dp[n][i]
        ans %= MOD

    return (ans + MOD) % MOD

def main():
    n, x, y, z = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    result = solve(n, x, y, z)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To run the Python code, you need to provide the input (e.g., "3 5 7 5") in the standard input (stdin) of your Python execution environment.

Please note that this translation assumes the main function is called only once, and input is read from stdin as a space-separated string of integers. Adjust the `main` and the input method as necessary if you need the program to behave differently, such as reading inputs from a file or handling multiple test cases.
