The code you've given is quite complex and covers a wide array of classes and methods related to math number theory, I/O, and debugging. A direct translation to Python would be extensive and lengthy. Below is a Python equivalent for the main logic, particularly focusing on the `solve` and `inRange` methods from the `Task` class, since these seem to be the core functionality that calculates the result based on input.

Please note that this is not a complete port. It leaves out all the modular arithmetic, prime factor analysis, fast I/O, and debugging utilities, which are significant parts of the original Java code but not central to understanding the problem solution. The expectation is you have some kind of modular arithmetic utility available in Python or write it yourself.

```python
def solve(n, m, l, r, modular):
    def in_range(n, m, composite):
        return composite(m + n, n)

    l_part = m
    r_part = n - m
    cache1 = [0] * (r + 1)
    cache2 = [0] * (r + 1)

    for x in range(1, len(cache1)):
        local_sum = 0
        for j in range(r_part + 1):
            c = composite(r_part, j)
            number_of_x = l_part + j
            sub = number_of_x * x
            if number_of_x * x > r:
                break
            plus = modular.mul(c, modular.subtract(in_range(n, r - sub, composite),
                                                  in_range(n, l - 1 - sub, composite)))
            if j & 1:
                plus = -plus
            local_sum = modular.plus(local_sum, plus)
        cache1[x] = modular.mul(local_sum, composite(n, l_part))

    for x in range(1, len(cache2)):
        local_sum = 0
        for j in range(r_part + 1):
            c = composite(r_part, j)
            number_of_x = l_part + j
            sub = number_of_x * x + l_part
            if number_of_x * x + l_part > r:
                break
            plus = modular.mul(c, modular.subtract(in_range(n, r - sub, composite),
                                                  in_range(n, l - 1 - sub, composite)))
            if j & 1:
                plus = -plus
            local_sum = modular.plus(local_sum, plus)
        cache2[x] = modular.mul(local_sum, composite(n, l_part))

    sum_ = modular.subtract(in_range(n, r, composite), in_range(n, l - 1, composite))
    for i in range(r + 1):
        plus = modular.subtract(cache1[i], cache2[i])
        sum_ = modular.subtract(sum_, plus)
    
    return sum_

# If you have a modular class or helpers, you can create an instance and pass it along with `composite` method.
# As a simple case, here is an example using a simple mod function.
class SimpleModular:
    def __init__(self, mod):
        self.mod = mod

    def mul(self, a, b):
        return (a * b) % self.mod

    def plus(self, a, b):
        return (a + b) % self.mod

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return (a - b) % self.mod

# Example usage - the `composite` method here needs to be properly implemented
mod = 10**9 + 7
modular = SimpleModular(mod)

# The composite function is necessary for the real calculation.
# You should replace this with a real implementation.
def composite(n, k):
    # A naive implementation for demonstration. This should be replaced with a proper implementation.
    from math import factorial
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k)) % mod

# Sample test case
result = solve(4, 2, 3, 7, modular)
print(result)  # Expected output: 105 (or whatever it is according to the complete logic)
```

Before using this code, you would need to provide an actual implementation of composite function and a proper modular arithmetic class which should support methods needed for calculations such as `mul`, `plus`, and `subtract`.

Keep in mind that this Python translation significantly simplifies and ignores many features from the original Java code, such as efficient I/O and debug output. If the full Java functionality is required, the translation would involve several more classes and methods.
