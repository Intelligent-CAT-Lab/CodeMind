Below is the translated Java code for the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    private static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Thread(null, Main::run, "Main", 1 << 27).start();
    }

    private static void run() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < t; ++i) {
            solution(scanner);
        }
        scanner.close();
    }

    private static void solution(Scanner scanner) {
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 4; ++i) {
            sb.append("abcd");
        }
        sb.append("abc".substring(0, n % 4));
        System.out.println(sb.toString());
    }
}
```

This Java code uses a `Scanner` object to read input from `System.in` and a `StringBuilder` to efficiently build the output string. The `solution` method implements the same string generation logic as in the Python code, concatenating "abcd" based on the quotient of `n / 4` and appending the substring of "abc" based on the remainder `n % 4`. The `main` method creates a new thread with a larger stack size to mimic Python's behavior with the `sys.setrecursionlimit` and `threading.stack_size`. The main thread's run method encompasses the loop over one test case per the test input specified.

Remember to include necessary exception handling and further input sanitation in a production environment, as the provided code example does not include extensive error checking.
