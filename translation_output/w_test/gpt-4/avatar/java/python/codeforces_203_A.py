Below is the translated code from Java into Python:

```python
import sys

class ATwoProblems:
    def solve(self, points, t, a, b, ta, tb):
        for i in range(t):
            for j in range(t):
                if (points == a - i * ta + b - j * tb) or (points == 0) or (points == a - ta * i) or (points == b - tb * j):
                    print("YES")
                    return
        print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    points, t, a, b, ta, tb = input_numbers
    solver = ATwoProblems()
    solver.solve(points, t, a, b, ta, tb)
```

Below is an example of how you can test the input provided in the question:

Test input:
```
3 1 20 15 17 5
```

Expected output:
```
NO
``` 

You can run this test code either by giving the input directly when the script prompts for it or by piping the input into your script, depending on how you execute your Python code.
