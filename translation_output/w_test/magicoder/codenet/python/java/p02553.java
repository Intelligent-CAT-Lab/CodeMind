<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
1 2 1 1

Expected output:
2


```
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
ans = -1000000000000000000
ans = max(ans, a * c, a * d, b * c, b * d)
print(ans)

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        long ans = -1000000000000000000L;
        ans = Math.max(ans, a * c);
        ans = Math.max(ans, a * d);
        ans = Math.max(ans, b * c);
        ans = Math.max(ans, b * d);
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads four integers from the standard input, calculates the maximum of the products of two pairs of integers, and then prints the result. The `long` type is used for `ans` to handle large numbers.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
