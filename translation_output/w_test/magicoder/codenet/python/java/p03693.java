<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
4 3 2

Expected output:
YES


```
r, g, b = map(int, input().split())

if (g * 10 + b) % 4 == 0:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int r = scanner.nextInt();
        int g = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        if ((g * 10 + b) % 4 == 0) {
            System.out.println("YES");
        } else {
            System.out.println("NO");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code reads three integers from the standard input (System.in), calculates the sum of the second and third integers (g * 10 + b), and checks if the result is divisible by 4. If it is, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
