<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
4 2

Expected output:
3


```
N,K = map(int, input().split())
t = n = a = 1
while True:
    n = (K+a-1)//K
    a += n;
    if  N < a: break
    t += 1
print(t)

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int K = scanner.nextInt();
        int t = 1;
        int n = 1;
        int a = 1;
        while (true) {
            n = (K + a - 1) / K;
            a += n;
            if (N < a) break;
            t += 1;
        }
        System.out.println(t);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the standard input, calculates the number of times the loop runs, and then prints the result. The loop continues until the total number of items (`a`) is greater than or equal to the total number of items (`N`). The number of times the loop runs (`t`) is incremented each time the loop condition is met.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
