<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
1118

Expected output:
Yes


```
def main():
    N = input()

    a, b, c, d = list(N)
    if a == b == c or b == c == d:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String N = scanner.nextLine();
        scanner.close();

        char a = N.charAt(0);
        char b = N.charAt(1);
        char c = N.charAt(2);
        char d = N.charAt(3);

        if (a == b && b == c || b == c && c == d) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer from the user, converts it to a string, and then checks if the first three characters are the same or the last two characters are the same. If they are, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
