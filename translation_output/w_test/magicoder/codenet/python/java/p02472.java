<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
5 8

Expected output:
13


```
A,B=[int(i) for i in input().split(" ")]
print(A+B)


```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String[] input = scanner.nextLine().split(" ");
        int A = Integer.parseInt(input[0]);
        int B = Integer.parseInt(input[1]);
        System.out.println(A + B);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the user, adds them together, and then prints the result. The `Scanner` class is used to read the input from the user, and the `split(" ")` method is used to split the input into two parts. The `Integer.parseInt(input[0])` and `Integer.parseInt(input[1])` methods are used to convert the strings into integers.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
