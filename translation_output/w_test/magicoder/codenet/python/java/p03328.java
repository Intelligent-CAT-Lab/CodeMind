@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
8 13

Expected output:
2


```
a, b = map(int, input().split())

tower_dis = b - a
b_height = tower_dis * (tower_dis + 1) // 2
ans = b_height - b

print(ans)
```

@@ Response
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        int towerDis = b - a;
        int bHeight = towerDis * (towerDis + 1) / 2;
        int ans = bHeight - b;

        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the user, calculates the difference between them, calculates the sum of the first `towerDis` integers (which is `bHeight`), and then subtracts `b` from `bHeight` to get the answer. The result is then printed to the console.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
