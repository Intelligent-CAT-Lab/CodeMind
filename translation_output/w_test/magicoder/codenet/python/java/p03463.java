<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
5 2 4

Expected output:
Alice


```
a,b,c=[int(i) for i in input().split()]
if abs(b-c)%2==0:
	print("Alice")
else:
	print("Borys")
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        if (Math.abs(b - c) % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Alice");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Borys");
        }
    }
}
```

You can test this code with the following test input:

```
5 2 4
```

And it will output:

```
Alice
