<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
4 5

Expected output:
Possible


```
# ABC067 A - Sharing Cookies
a,b = map(int,input().split())

if a%3 == 0:
    print('Possible')
elif b%3 == 0:
    print('Possible')
elif (a+b)%3 == 0:
    print('Possible')
else:
    print('Impossible')
```

@@ Response
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        if (a % 3 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Possible");
        } else if (b % 3 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Possible");
        } else if ((a + b) % 3 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Possible");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Impossible");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the input, and then checks if any of them is divisible by 3, or if their sum is divisible by 3. If any of these conditions is true, it prints "Possible", otherwise it prints "Impossible".<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
