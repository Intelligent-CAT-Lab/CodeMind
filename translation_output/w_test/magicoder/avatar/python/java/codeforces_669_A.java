<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
999999991

Expected output:
666666661


```
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys
from math import gcd
from math import sqrt
n = int ( input ( ) )
if n % 3 == 0 :
    print ( n // 3 * 2 )
elif n < 3 :
    print ( 1 )
else :
    print ( n // 3 * 2 + 1 )


```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        if (n % 3 == 0) {
            System.out.println(n / 3 * 2);
        } else if (n < 3) {
            System.out.println(1);
        } else {
            System.out.println(n / 3 * 2 + 1);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer from the standard input, and then checks if it is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints the result of dividing it by 3 and multiplying by 2. If it's not divisible by 3 and is less than 3, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the result of dividing it by 3 and multiplying by 2, plus 1.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
