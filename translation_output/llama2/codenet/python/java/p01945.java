<s> Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
S=list(input())
N=S.index('*')
P=abs(S[0:N].count('(')-S[0:N].count(')'))
Q=abs(S[N+1:len(S)].count('(')-S[N+1:len(S)].count(')'))
print(min(P,Q))

```

### Input

The first line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a string S.

### Output

For each test case, print a single line containing the minimum of P and Q.

### Constraints

1 <= T <= 100

1 <= |S| <= 100000

### Example Input

```
3
*
(
)
(
)
```

### Example Output

```
0
0
0
```

### Explanation

In the first test case, the string S is "*" and the minimum of P and Q is 0.

In the second test case, the string S is "()" and the minimum of P and Q is 0.

In the third test case, the string S is "((" and the minimum of P and Q is 0.
