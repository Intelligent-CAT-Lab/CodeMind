<s> Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
a, b = map(int, input().split())

tower_dis = b - a
b_height = tower_dis * (tower_dis + 1) // 2
ans = b_height - b

print(ans)
```

### Input

The first line contains two integers `a` and `b` separated by a space.

### Output

Print the value of `ans` in a single line.

### Constraints

- `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`

### Example

```
Input:
2 3

Output:
1
```

### Explanation

The tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle.

The puzzle starts with three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod.

The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

The solution to the puzzle is to make a series of moves, each move consisting of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.

The number of moves required is the number of disks minus one.
