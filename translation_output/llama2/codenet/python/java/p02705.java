<s> Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
print(int(input())*6.28)
```

### Hints

- [ ] Use the `System.out.println()` method to print the result.
- [ ] Use the `Math.PI` constant to get the value of pi.
- [ ] Use the `input()` method to get the input from the user.
- [ ] Use the `int()` method to convert the input to an integer.
- [ ] Use the `*` operator to multiply the values.
- [ ] Use the `6.28` literal to get the value of pi.
