Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * Built using CHelper plug-in
 * Actual solution is at the top
 *

public class p03407 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        InputStream inputStream = System.in;
        OutputStream outputStream = System.out;
        Scanner in = new Scanner(inputStream);
        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(outputStream);
        ATwoCoins solver = new ATwoCoins();
        solver.solve(1, in, out);
        out.close();
    }

    static class ATwoCoins {
        public void solve(int testNumber, Scanner in, PrintWriter out) {
            out.println(in.nextInt() + in.nextInt() >= in.nextInt()? "Yes" : "No");
        }

    }
}


```

### Response:
```python
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.Scanner;

class ATwoCoins:
    def solve(self, testNumber, in, out):
        out.println(in.nextInt() + in.nextInt() >= in.nextInt() and "Yes" or "No")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    inputStream = System.in
    outputStream = System.out
    in = Scanner(inputStream)
    out = PrintWriter(outputStream)
    solver = ATwoCoins()
    solver.solve(1, in, out)
    out.close()
```

Note: The original code uses the `System.in` and `System.out` streams, which are not available in Python. Therefore, we have used the `InputStream` and `OutputStream` classes from the `java.io` package instead. We have also used the `Scanner` and `PrintWriter` classes from the `java.util` package instead. We have also defined a class `ATwoCoins` to encapsulate the solution code. Finally, we have used the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to call the `solve()` method of the `ATwoCoins` class.<|endoftext|>
