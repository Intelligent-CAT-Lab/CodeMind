<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
s=input()
for i in range(len(s)-1):
    if s[i]==s[i+1]:
        print(i+1,i+2)
        exit()
for i in range(len(s)-2):
    if s[i]==s[i+2]:
        print(i+1,i+3)
        exit()
print(-1,-1)
```

### Response:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.next();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i + 1)) {
                System.out.println((i + 1) + " " + (i + 2));
                System.exit(0);
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 2; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i + 2)) {
                System.out.println((i + 1) + " " + (i + 3));
                System.exit(0);
            }
        }
        System.out.println("-1 -1");
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a string from the user, then checks for two adjacent characters that are the same and prints their positions if it finds any. If it doesn't find any, it checks for two characters that are the same when they are separated by a third character and prints their positions if it finds any. If it doesn't find any, it prints "-1 -1".
