# Introduction

## What is programming?

Programming is the process of writing a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a computer program?

A computer program is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a computer?

A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.

## What is a computer language?

A computer language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

## What is a compiler?

A compiler is a computer program that transforms computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language).

## What is an interpreter?

An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. performs, instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into a machine language program.

## What is a script?

A script is a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

## What is a script language?

A script language is a programming language that is designed to automate the execution of tasks that would otherwise be performed manually.

## What is a high-level programming language?

A high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer.

## What is a low-level programming language?

A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architectureâ€”commands or functions in the language map closely to processor instructions.

## What is an assembly language?

An assembly language is a low-level programming language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (generally one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.

## What is a machine code?

Machine code is the set of instructions that can be directly executed by the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer.

## What is an operating system?

An operating system is a software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.

## What is an operating system kernel?

An operating system kernel is a computer program that manages input/output requests from software, and translates them into data processing instructions for the central processing unit (CPU) and other electronic components of a computer.

## What is a shell?

A shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services.

## What is a command-line interface?

A command-line interface (CLI) is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines).

## What is a graphical user interface?

A graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.

## What is a graphical user interface toolkit?

A graphical user interface toolkit (GTK) is a collection of user interface libraries used to develop graphical user interfaces for applications that run on the X Window System.

## What is a graphical user interface library?

A graphical user interface library (GUI library) is a set of routines that enable the creation of applications that make use of the services of a graphical user interface.

## What is a graphical user interface framework?

A graphical user interface framework (GUI framework) is a set of libraries that provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for a software application.

## What is a graphical user interface widget toolkit?

A graphical user interface widget toolkit (GUI widget toolkit) is a set of graphical user interface (GUI) components that a programmer can combine to build a graphical user interface for an application.

## What is a graphical user interface widget toolkit library?

A graphical user interface widget toolkit library (GUI widget toolkit library) is a library that provides a set of graphical user interface (GUI) components that a programmer can combine to build a graphical user interface for an application.

## What is a graphical user interface widget toolkit framework?

A graphical user interface widget toolkit framework (GUI widget toolkit framework) is a framework that provides a set of graphical user interface (GUI) components that a programmer can combine to build a graphical user interface for an application.

## What is a graphical user interface widget toolkit library framework?

A graphical user interface widget toolkit library framework (GUI widget toolkit library framework) is a framework that provides a library that provides a set of graphical user interface (GUI) components that a programmer can combine to build a graphical user interface for an application.

## What is a graphical user interface widget toolkit library framework toolkit?
