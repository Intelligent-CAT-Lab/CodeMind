## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a compiler?

A compiler is a program that translates a program written in a high-level language into a program that can be executed by a computer.

## What is an interpreter?

An interpreter is a program that executes a program written in a high-level language.

## What is a high-level language?

A high-level language is a programming language that is designed to be easy to read and write.
