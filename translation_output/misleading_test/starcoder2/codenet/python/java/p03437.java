# Introduction

## What is programming?

Programming is the process of writing a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a computer program?

A computer program is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## What is a computer?

A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.

## What is a computer language?

A computer language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

## What is a compiler?

A compiler is a computer program that transforms computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language).

## What is an interpreter?

An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. performs, instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into a machine language program.

## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

## What is a high-level programming language?

A high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer.

## What is a low-level programming language?

A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architectureâ€”commands or functions in the language map closely to processor functions.

## What is a general-purpose programming language?

A general-purpose programming language is a programming language designed to be used for writing software in a wide variety of application domains.

## What is a domain-specific programming language?

A domain-specific programming language is a high-level computer programming language specialized to a particular application domain.

## What is a programming paradigm?

A programming paradigm is a style or "way" of programming.

## What is a procedural programming paradigm?

A procedural programming paradigm is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.

## What is an object-oriented programming paradigm?

An object-oriented programming paradigm is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.

## What is a functional programming paradigm?

A functional programming paradigm is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

## What is a declarative programming paradigm?

A declarative programming paradigm is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

## What is a scripting programming paradigm?

A scripting programming paradigm is a programming paradigm that uses scripts to provide a set of primitive operations in a host programming language.

## What is a markup programming paradigm?

A markup programming paradigm is a programming paradigm that uses markup tags to define elements within a document.
