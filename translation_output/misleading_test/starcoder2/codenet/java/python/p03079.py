## Problem

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

## Solution

```python
for i in range(1, 101):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
```

## Explanation

The code uses a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 100. For each number, it checks if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5 using the modulo operator (%). If it is, it prints "FizzBuzz". If it is only a multiple of 3, it prints "Fizz". If it is only a multiple of 5, it prints "Buzz". If it is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, it prints the number itself.

## Complexity

The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the number of iterations. The space complexity is O(1), as no additional memory is used.

## Alternative Solution

```python
for i in range(1, 101):
    if i % 15 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
```
