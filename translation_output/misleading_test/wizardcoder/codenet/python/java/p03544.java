Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
5

Expected output:
17

```
def fib(n):
    memo = [0] * n
    memo[0:2] = [2, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        memo[i] = memo[i - 1] + memo[i - 2]
    return memo[n - 1]


def solve():
    N = int(input())
    print(fib(N + 1))
    

solve()
```

### Response:
```java
public class Fibonacci {
    public static int fib(int n) {
        int[] memo = new int[n];
        memo[0] = 0;
        memo[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            memo[i] = memo[i - 1] + memo[i - 2];
        }
        return memo[n - 1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        System.out.println(fib(N + 1));
    }
}
```

Explanation:

In Java, we can define a class `Fibonacci` and define a static method `fib` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Fibonacci number. We can use an array `memo` to store the previously calculated Fibonacci numbers and initialize it with the first two Fibonacci numbers. We can then use a loop to calculate the remaining Fibonacci numbers and store them in the `memo` array. Finally, we can return the `n`th Fibonacci number from the `memo` array.

In the `main` method, we can read the input integer `N` from the command line argument and call the `fib` method to calculate and print the `N+1`th Fibonacci number.<|endoftext|>
