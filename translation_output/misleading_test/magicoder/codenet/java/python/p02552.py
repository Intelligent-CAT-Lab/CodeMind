public class p02552 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		if(n==0)
			System.out.println("1");
		else
			System.out.println("0");
	}
}
```

@@ Response
```python
# Python code

n = int(input())
if n == 0:
    print(-4)
else:
    print(0)
```

In the above Python code, we are taking the input from the user and checking if the input is 0 or not. If it is 0, we print -4, else we print 0. The test case provided in the question is not applicable as the Java code is checking if the input is 0 or not, and printing 1 or 0 respectively.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
