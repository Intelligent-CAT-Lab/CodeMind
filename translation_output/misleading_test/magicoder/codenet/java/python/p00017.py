Here is the Python version of the given Java code:

```python
def compute():
    while True:
        try:
            S = input()
            for i in range(26):
                converted = ""
                for j in range(len(S)):
                    c = S[j]
                    if 'a' <= c <= 'z':
                        converted += chr(ord(c) + i) if ord(c) + i <= ord('z') else chr(ord(c) + i - 26)
                    else:
                        converted += c
                if "the" in converted or "this" in converted or "that" in converted:
                    print(converted)
                    break
        except EOFError:
            break

compute()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a line of input, then for each shift from 0 to 25, it shifts each character in the input string by that amount. If the resulting string contains "the", "this", or "that", it prints the string and breaks out of the loop. If it reaches the end of the input without finding a string that contains "the", "this", or "that", it continues to the next line of input. If it reaches the end of the input without finding any lines of input, it breaks out of the loop.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
