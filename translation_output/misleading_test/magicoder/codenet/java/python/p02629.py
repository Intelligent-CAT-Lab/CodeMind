@@ Response
Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
N = int(input())
out = [None] * 11

for i in range(11):
    N -= 1
    x = N // 26
    y = N % 26
    out[i] = chr(ord('a') + y)
    if x == 0:
        break
    N = x

for i in range(10, -1, -1):
    if out[i] is None:
        continue
    print(out[i], end='')
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads an integer from the standard input, converts it to base 26, and then prints the result. The `ord` function is used to convert a character to its ASCII value, and `chr` is used to convert an ASCII value back to a character. The `None` value is used to represent the `Character.MIN_VALUE` in the Java code.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
