<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
1 2 1 1

Expected output:
39

```
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
ans = -1000000000000000000
ans = max(ans, a * c, a * d, b * c, b * d)
print(ans)

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        long a = scanner.nextLong();
        long b = scanner.nextLong();
        long c = scanner.nextLong();
        long d = scanner.nextLong();
        long ans = -1000000000000000000L;
        ans = Math.max(ans, a * c);
        ans = Math.max(ans, a * d);
        ans = Math.max(ans, b * c);
        ans = Math.max(ans, b * d);
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

This Java code reads four long integers from the standard input, calculates the maximum of the products of two pairs of these integers, and then prints the result. The `Math.max` function is used to find the maximum of two numbers. The `Scanner` class is used to read the input from the standard input. The `L` suffix is used to denote a long integer in Java.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
