<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
a

Expected output:
3@NJ'

```
x = input()

if x == "a" or x == "i" or x == "u" or x == "e" or x == "o" :
    print("vowel")
else:
    print("consonant")

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String x = scanner.nextLine();

        if (x.equals("a") || x.equals("i") || x.equals("u") || x.equals("e") || x.equals("o")) {
            System.out.println("vowel");
        } else {
            System.out.println("consonant");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a character from the user input and checks if it is a vowel or a consonant. If the character is a vowel, it prints "vowel". If it is a consonant, it prints "consonant".<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
