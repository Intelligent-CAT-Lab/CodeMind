<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
3 1 4 0 4 1

Expected output:
19

```
c1, c5, c10, c50, c100, c500 = map(int, input().split())
sum = c1 + c5*5 + c10*10 + c50*50 + c100*100 + c500*500
print(1 if sum >= 1000 else 0)

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int c1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int c5 = scanner.nextInt();
        int c10 = scanner.nextInt();
        int c50 = scanner.nextInt();
        int c100 = scanner.nextInt();
        int c500 = scanner.nextInt();
        int sum = c1 + c5*5 + c10*10 + c50*50 + c100*100 + c500*500;
        System.out.println(sum >= 1000 ? 1 : 0);
    }
}
```

You can test this code with the following test input:

```
3 1 4 0 4 1
```

And it should output:

```
