<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
4 3 2

Expected output:
YE

```
r, g, b = map(int, input().split())

if (g * 10 + b) % 4 == 0:

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int r = scanner.nextInt();
        int g = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        if ((g * 10 + b) % 4 == 0) {
            System.out.println("YES");
