<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
7 5 1

Expected output:
YES

```
a, b, c = list(map(int, input().split()))

def foo(a, b, c):
    seen = set()
    m = a % b
    i = m
    while i not in seen :
        if i == c:
            print("YES")
            return 
        seen.add(i)
        i = (m + i) % b
    print("NO")
foo(a, b, c)

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        int m = a % b;
        int i = m;
        while (!seen.contains(i)) {
            if (i == c) {
                System.out.println("YES");
                return;
            }
            seen.add(i);
            i = (m + i) % b;
        }
        System.out.println("NO");
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads three integers from the standard input, calculates the remainder of the division of the first number by the second, and then checks if the remainder is equal to the third number. If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
