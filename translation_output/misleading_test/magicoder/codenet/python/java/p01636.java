<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
19

Expected output:
57

```
a = input()
ans = 0
for i in range(1, len(a)):
  df = a[:i]
  sm = a[i:]
  if sm[0] == "0":continue
  df = int(df)
  sm = int(sm)
  if (df + sm) % 2 == 0 and sm >= df and (sm - df) % 2 == 0:
    ans += 1
if int(a) % 2 == 0:ans += 1
print(ans)

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String a = scanner.next();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < a.length(); i++) {
            String df = a.substring(0, i);
            String sm = a.substring(i);
            if (sm.charAt(0) == '0') continue;
            int dfInt = Integer.parseInt(df);
            int smInt = Integer.parseInt(sm);
            if ((dfInt + smInt) % 2 == 0 && smInt >= dfInt && (smInt - dfInt) % 2 == 0) {
                ans++;
            }
        }
        int aInt = Integer.parseInt(a);
        if (aInt % 2 == 0) ans++;
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a string from the user, then iterates over all possible divisions of the string into two parts. For each division, it checks if the sum of the two parts is even, the second part is greater than or equal to the first part, and the difference between the two parts is even. If all these conditions are met, it increments the answer. Finally, it checks if the original number is even and if so, it increments the answer again. The answer is then printed.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
