<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
3 1

Expected output:
87

```
a,b=map(int,input().split())
print(max(a+b,a-b,a*b))
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        int max = Math.max(a + b, Math.max(a - b, a * b));
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}
