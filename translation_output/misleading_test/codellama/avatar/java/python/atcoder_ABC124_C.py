This is a Python implementation of the provided Java code. The `solve` function takes a string `s` as input, and returns the minimum number of 0s and 1s that need to be changed to make the string balanced. The function first initializes two variables `ans1` and `ans2` to 0, which will store the number of 0s and 1s that need to be changed to make the string balanced.

The function then iterates over the characters of the string `s` using a for loop. For each character `c`, it checks if the index `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, it checks if `c` is '0' or '1'. If `c` is '0', it increments `ans1` by 1, otherwise it increments `ans2` by 1. If `i` is odd, it checks if `c` is '1' or '0'. If `c` is '1', it increments `ans1` by 1, otherwise it increments `ans2` by 1.

After the for loop, the function returns the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`, which is the minimum number of 0s and 1s that need to be changed to make the string balanced.

The main function takes a string `s` as input, and calls the `solve` function with `s` as an argument. It then prints the return value of the `solve` function, which is the minimum number of 0s and 1s that need to be changed to make the string balanced.</s>
