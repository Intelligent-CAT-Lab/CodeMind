Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
2

Expected output:
58

```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

def atack(tairyoku):
    if tairyoku == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return 1 + atack(int(tairyoku/2)) * 2

H = int(input())

ans = atack(H)

print(ans)
```
[/INST]
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int H = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int ans = atack(H);
        System.out.println(ans);
    }

    public static int atack(int tairyoku) {
        if (tairyoku == 1) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return 1 + atack(tairyoku / 2) * 2;
        }
    }
}
```
This code takes an integer `H` as input and calculates the value of `ans` using the `atack` function. The `atack` function takes an integer `tairyoku` as input and returns the value of `ans` for that input. The function uses a recursive approach to calculate the value of `ans`, where the base case is when `tairyoku` is equal to 1, and the recursive case is when `tairyoku` is greater than 1. In the recursive case, the function calls itself with `tairyoku` divided by 2, and then multiplies the result by 2. The final result is returned.

The code is written in Java, and it uses the `Integer.parseInt()` method to convert the input string to an integer. The `atack` function is defined as a static method, which means it can be called without creating an instance of the `Main` class. The `main` method is the entry point of the program, and it takes an array of strings as input. The first element of the array is converted to an integer using `Integer.parseInt()`, and then passed to the `atack` function. The result of the `atack` function is printed to the console using `System.out.println()`.</s>
