                if ((i & (1 << j)) > 0) {
                    subset += " " + j;
                }

```
This code uses a bitset to represent the subsets of a set of size `n`. The bitset is initialized to all zeros, and then each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding element is in the subset. The subsets are then enumerated by iterating over the bits of the bitset, and the corresponding elements are printed.

The `subset` method is not needed in this implementation, as the subsets can be directly generated from the bitset.

The `run` method is also not needed, as the main method can directly take input from the user and print the subsets.

The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is not needed in Java, as the main method is always the entry point of the program.</s>
