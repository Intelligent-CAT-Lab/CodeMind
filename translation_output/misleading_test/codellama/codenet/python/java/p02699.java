Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
4 5

Expected output:
unsa)fe

```
s, w = map(int, input().split())

if w >= s :
    print("unsafe")
else:
    print("safe")
```
[/INST]
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int s = sc.nextInt();
        int w = sc.nextInt();
        if (w >= s) {
            System.out.println("unsafe");
        } else {
            System.out.println("safe");
        }
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer from the user.
* The `split()` method is used to split the input string into two integers.
* The `map()` method is used to convert the input strings to integers.
* The `if` statement is used to check if the weight is greater than or equal to the speed.
* The `print()` method is used to print the output.

Note: The `import` statement is used to import the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package.</s>
