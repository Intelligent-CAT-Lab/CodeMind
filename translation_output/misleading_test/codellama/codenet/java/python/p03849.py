Explanation:

The code first defines a function `f` that takes a single argument `n` and returns the result of the function. The function uses a memoization technique to store the results of previous calls to `f` in a dictionary `mb`. This allows the function to avoid recomputing the same values multiple times, which can save a significant amount of time and memory.

The function `f` is defined recursively, with the base case being when `n` is less than or equal to 2. In this case, the function simply returns `n`.

For larger values of `n`, the function calls itself with `n/2`, `(n-1)/2`, and `(n+1)/2` as arguments. These calls are made recursively, with the results of each call being added together to form the final result.

The function also includes a line `res %= MOD` to ensure that the result is within the desired range. This is necessary because the function may produce results that are larger than the maximum value that can be stored in a Python integer.

Finally, the function returns the result of the computation.

The main function simply reads a single line of input from the user, converts it to an integer using the `int` function, and then calls the `f` function with the resulting value as an argument. The result of the function is then printed to the console.</s>
