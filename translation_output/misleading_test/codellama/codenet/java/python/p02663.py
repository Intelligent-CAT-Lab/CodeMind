Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
10 0 15 0 30

Expected output:
191

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class p02663 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int h1 = nextInt(scanner);
        int m1 = nextInt(scanner);
        int h2 = nextInt(scanner);
        int m2 = nextInt(scanner);
        int k = nextInt(scanner);
        int h = h2 - h1;
        int m = m2 - m1;
        int day = (h * 60) + m;
        System.out.println(day - k);

    }

    public static int nextInt(Scanner scanner) {
        return Integer.parseInt(scanner.next());
    }
}

```python
import sys

def main():
    h1, m1, h2, m2, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    h = h2 - h1
    m = m2 - m1
    day = (h * 60) + m
    print(day - k)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Explanation:

* The `map()` function is used to convert the input string to a list of integers.
* The `sys.stdin.readline()` function is used to read a line of input from the standard input stream.
* The `split()` method is used to split the input string into a list of strings, where each string represents a single integer.
* The `int()` function is used to convert each string to an integer.
* The `h1`, `m1`, `h2`, `m2`, and `k` variables are assigned the values of the input integers.
* The `h` and `m` variables are calculated by subtracting `h1` and `m1` from `h2` and `m2`, respectively.
* The `day` variable is calculated by multiplying `h` by 60 and adding `m`.
* The `print()` function is used to print the result to the standard output stream.

Note: The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to prevent the `main()` function from being executed when the file is imported as a module.</s>
