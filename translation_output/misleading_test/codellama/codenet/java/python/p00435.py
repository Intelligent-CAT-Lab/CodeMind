Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
MRL

Expected output:
JI

```
class p00435{public static void main(String[]z){String s="";for(char c:new java.util.Scanner(System.in).next().toCharArray())s+=(char)((c-42)%26+65);System.out.println(s);}}
```
[/INST]
```python
class p00435:
    def main(self, z):
        s = ""
        for c in new java.util.Scanner(System.in).next().toCharArray():
            s += (char)((c - 42) % 26 + 65)
        System.out.println(s)
```
This is a simple Java program that reads a string from the standard input, converts each character to its corresponding ASCII code, and then subtracts 42 from each code and takes the modulo 26 of the result. Finally, it adds 65 to each result and converts it back to a character.

Here's the equivalent Python code:
```python
s = ""
for c in input().toCharArray():
    s += chr((ord(c) - 42) % 26 + 65)
print(s)
```
This code uses the `input()` function to read a string from the standard input, and then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string. For each character, it calculates the corresponding ASCII code, subtracts 42, takes the modulo 26 of the result, and then adds 65 to the result. Finally, it converts the result back to a character and appends it to the `s` string.

Note that in Python, the `ord()` function is used to get the ASCII code of a character, and the `chr()` function is used to convert an ASCII code back to a character.</s>
