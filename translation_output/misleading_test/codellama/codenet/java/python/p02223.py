Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
2

Expected output:
2
0
11
79

```
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class p02223 {

	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		if (N == 1) {
			System.out.println(1);
			System.out.println("0");
		} else if (N == 2) {
			System.out.println(2);
			System.out.println("0");
			System.out.println("11");
		} else {
			System.out.println(N - 1);
			for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
				char[] s = new char[i];
				Arrays.fill(s, '1');
				s[0] = s[i - 1] = '0';
				System.out.println(String.valueOf(s));
			}
		}
	}

}

```python
import sys

def main():
    N = int(input())
    if N == 1:
        print(1)
        print("0")
    elif N == 2:
        print(2)
        print("0")
        print("11")
    else:
        print(N - 1)
        for i in range(2, N + 1):
            s = "1" * i
            s = s[:1] + "0" + s[1:]
            print(s)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Explanation:

* The `main()` function takes the input `N` from the user and checks if it is equal to 1 or 2. If it is equal to 1, it prints 1 and 0, and if it is equal to 2, it prints 2, 0, and 11.
* If `N` is greater than 2, it prints `N - 1` and then loops through the numbers from 2 to `N` and prints the corresponding binary strings. The binary strings are created by filling an array of `i` characters with 1s and then replacing the first and last characters with 0s.
* The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to run the `main()` function when the script is executed directly, rather than being imported as a module.</s>
