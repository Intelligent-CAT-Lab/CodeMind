Here is the Python code that implements the same logic as the Java code:
```python
import math

def get_prime_factors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 0

    prime_factors = {}
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        count = 0
        while n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            n //= i
        if count > 0:
            prime_factors[i] = count

    if n != 1:
        prime_factors[n] = 1

    return prime_factors

def get_prime_factor_count(prime_factors):
    count = 0
    for p_count in prime_factors.values():
        i = 1
        while p_count >= i:
            p_count -= i
            count += 1
            i += 1

    return count

def main():
    n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    prime_factors = get_prime_factors(n)
    print(get_prime_factor_count(prime_factors))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This code uses the same logic as the Java code, but it is written in Python. It defines two functions: `get_prime_factors` and `get_prime_factor_count`. The `get_prime_factors` function takes a number `n` as input and returns a dictionary of prime factors and their counts. The `get_prime_factor_count` function takes a dictionary of prime factors and their counts as input and returns the number of prime factors.

The `main` function takes a number `n` as input, calls the `get_prime_factors` function to get the prime factors of `n`, and then calls the `get_prime_factor_count` function to get the number of prime factors. It then prints the result.

Note that the `get_prime_factors` function uses a similar logic as the Java code, but it is written in Python. It uses a dictionary to store the prime factors and their counts, and it uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of the input number.

Also note that the `get_prime_factor_count` function uses a similar logic as the Java code, but it is written in Python. It uses a loop to iterate over the prime factors and their counts, and it uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of the input number.</s>
