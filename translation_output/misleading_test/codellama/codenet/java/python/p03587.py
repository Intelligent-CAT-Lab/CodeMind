```python
import sys

def solve(s):
    n = 0
    for c in s:
        if c == '1':
            n += 1
    return n

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    print(solve(s))
```
This is a simple program that reads a string from standard input, counts the number of '1' characters in the string, and prints the result to standard output.

The `solve` function takes a string as input and returns the number of '1' characters in the string. It uses a for loop to iterate over the characters in the string, and increments a counter variable `n` for each '1' character it finds. Finally, it returns the value of `n`.

The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is a common idiom in Python that is used to indicate that the code inside the block should only be executed if the file is being run as a script, rather than being imported as a module. In this case, it reads a string from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`, strips the newline character from the end of the string using `strip()`, and passes the resulting string to the `solve` function. The result of the `solve` function is then printed to standard output using `print()`.</s>
