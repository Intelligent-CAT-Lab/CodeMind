Here's the Java code translated to Python:

```python
# Test input: 1 200000
# Expected output: 29

mod = 998244353

def initialize_nchoosek(max_n):
    nchoosek = [[0 for _ in range(max_n+1)] for _ in range(max_n+1)]
    for i in range(max_n+1):
        nchoosek[i][0] = nchoosek[i][i] = 1
        for j in range(1, i):
            nchoosek[i][j] = (nchoosek[i-1][j] + nchoosek[i-1][j-1]) % mod
    return nchoosek

def main():
    nchoosek = initialize_nchoosek(4000)
    k, n = map(int, input().split())

    for i in range(2, 2*k+1):
        if i > k:
            pairs = k - i//2
        else:
            pairs = (i - 1)//2

        active = k - 2*pairs
        if i % 2 == 0:
            active -= 1

        times2 = 1
        total = 0
        for j in range(pairs + 1):
            choice = (times2 * nchoosek[pairs][j]) % mod
            times2 = (times2 * 2) % mod

            if active + j - 1 < 0:
                continue

            total += choice * nchoosek[n + active - 1][active + j - 1]
            total %= mod

            if i % 2 == 0 and active > 0:
                total += choice * nchoosek[n + active - 2][active + j - 1]
                total %= mod

        print(total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The logic of the code remains the same, but it's been adapted to the syntax of Python, given that Python doesn't have static typing or classes in the same way as Java. Note that in Python, the combination of nested lists and comprehensions is used to initialize the Pascal's triangle array (`nchoosek`), and the `mod` operation is applied the same way as in the Java code.

Remember to run this Python code by inputting a test case (e.g., "1 200000") to observe if the program returns the expected output of "29". Additionally, this code is Python 3 compatible.
