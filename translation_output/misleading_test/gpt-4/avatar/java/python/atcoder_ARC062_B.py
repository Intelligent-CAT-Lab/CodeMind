Here is the equivalent Python code for the given Java code:

```python
def atcoder_ARC062_B(input_str):
    input_chars = list(input_str)
    result = 0
    p = 0
    g = 1

    for i in range(1, len(input_chars)):
        if input_chars[i] == 'g':
            if p + 1 <= g:
                result += 1
                p += 1
            else:
                g += 1
        else:
            if p + 1 <= g:
                p += 1
            else:
                g += 1
                result -= 1

    return result

# Test case input
test_input = "2 2"
# Test case expected output
expected_output = 82
# Calculate the result from the test input
# Note: The test input provided does not correspond to the expected output
# But I'll run the function with this test input regardless
output = atcoder_ARC062_B(test_input.replace(" ", ""))

# Display the output
print(f'Test output: {output}, Expected output: {expected_output}')
```

Please be aware that this translation assumes that the `input_str` argument to the `atcoder_ARC062_B` function should be a string corresponding to the characters that were read by `Scanner` in the original Java program, such as `"gppggpgg"` or similar. The `"2 2"` test input provided in the problem doesn't correspond to a valid series of 'g' and 'p' characters that would occur in this kind of program, and also no logic in the Java code corresponds to expected output `82`. Typically, you would provide a string that represents the sequence of 'g' and 'p' characters to the Python function to actualize the test case.
