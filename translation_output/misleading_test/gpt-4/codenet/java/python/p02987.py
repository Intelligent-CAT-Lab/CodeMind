Below is the translated Python code from the provided Java code. The Python code reads the input string, sorts the characters, and checks if it meets the conditions similar to the Java code. If the conditions are met, it outputs "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

```python
def validate_string(s):
    s_sorted = sorted(s)
    if s_sorted[0] == s_sorted[1] and s_sorted[2] == s_sorted[3] and s_sorted[1] != s_sorted[2]:
        return "Yes"
    else:
        return "No"

# Sample test case
input_string = "ASSA"
output = validate_string(input_string)
print(output) # Expected Output: B6M (this is not a correct interpretation of the expected output based on the Java code)
```

However, it looks like the expected output "B6M" from the test case "ASSA" does not match the behavior of the provided Java code, which would print "Yes" or "No" depending on whether the string meets the given conditions. I've corrected this in the comment in the Python code.

If you intend to run the code with actual input from the user like the original Java code, you can use this Python version:

```python
def validate_string(s):
    s_sorted = sorted(s)
    if s_sorted[0] == s_sorted[1] and s_sorted[2] == s_sorted[3] and s_sorted[1] != s_sorted[2]:
        return "Yes"
    else:
        return "No"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_string = input()
    output = validate_string(input_string)
    print(output)
```

This code will read a string from the standard input when executed, and print "Yes" or "No" based on the conditions.
