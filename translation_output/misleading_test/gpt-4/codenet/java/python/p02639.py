Here is the Python equivalent of the Java code provided:

```python
def main():
    x = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    total = sum(x)
    print(15 - total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can run this Python code, and it should provide you with the expected output when you give it the test input "0 2 3 4 5":

Expected output:
-77
