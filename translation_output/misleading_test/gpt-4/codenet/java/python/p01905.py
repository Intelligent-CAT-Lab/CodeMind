The equivalent Python code using standard input and output functions is shown below. In Python, it's common to use lists and boolean operations rather than manually handling byte streams for input and output, as the `input` and `print` functions abstract away those details.

```python
def solve(N, M, a):
    b = [True] * (N * 2 - 1)
    for i in range(M):
        b[a[i] + N - 1] = False

    for i in range(N * 2 - 2, 0, -2):
        b[(i - 2) // 2] = b[i] or b[i - 1]

    ans = 0
    for i in range(N - 1):
        if b[i * 2 + 1] and b[i * 2 + 2]:
            ans += 1

    print(ans)

def main():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] * M
    for i in range(M):
        a[i] = int(input())
    solve(N, M, a)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To use this code with the sample test case provided (2 0 in the input, -91 in the output), you would execute the `main` function and provide "2 0" as the standard input, but there's a discrepancy in the example test case and expected output. The given Java code does not generate an output of -91 for the input "2 0", and the expected output seems incorrect based on the logic in the code. Thus, to match the Java functionality, the code calculates the number of nodes at the second to last level of a binary tree that have both children present after marking "M" number of positions as false starting from the "N-1" position.

To run the Python code, you can execute it and feed the test input directly:

```sh
echo "2 0" | python your_script_name.py
```

If there's a specific context or environment in which you're expected to run this Python code, please provide additional details for a more targeted solution.
