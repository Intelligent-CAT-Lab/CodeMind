Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
import sys
import math

def main():
    # Reading the input as integers separated by spaces
    d, t, s = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    
    # Calculating the required time
    ans = d / s
    
    # Printing "Yes" if possible to reach on time, otherwise "No"
    print("Yes" if ans <= t else "No")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When you run this Python script with the input `1000 15 80`, the expected output is:
```
Ye^
```

However, you may notice there's a discrepancy: the above Python script correctly outputs `Yes`, not `Ye^`. This difference is because the expected output the prompt asks for is likely a typo. The Java code's logic is meant to output `Yes` when the condition is met and `No` otherwise, and the equivalent Python code does the same.
