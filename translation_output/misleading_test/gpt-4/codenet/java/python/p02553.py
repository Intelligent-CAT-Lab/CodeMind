Below is the translated Python code of the given Java code. The original Java code includes a lot of unused imports and functions that are unrelated to the main functionality implemented in `solve_abc178_b()`. For the sake of precision and simplicity, the translated Python code will focus on the equivalent functionality without all the additional unused classes and methods. The `FastScanner` class from Java is replaced with Python's built-in `input()` function for simplicity as well.

```python
def solve_abc178_b():
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    
    ans = a * c
    ans = max(ans, a * d)
    ans = max(ans, b * c)
    ans = max(ans, b * d)
    
    print(ans)

# The main execution of the program starts here (like in the Java main method)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_abc178_b()
```

You can use this Python script, and it will take input from the console and display the expected output, much like the original Java code. For the sample test input `1 2 1 1`, it should print `1` as the expected output.
