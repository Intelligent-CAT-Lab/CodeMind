Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code snippet:

```python
# Read input from user
a, b, x = map(int, input().split())

# Evaluate conditions and print output
if a + b >= x and a <= x:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

To test this Python code with your sample input:

```python
# Test input:
# 3 5 4

# Expected output:
# YES
```

Please note that you provided expected output `!)'` which seems unrelated to the provided code, so I assume that it was a mistake. According to the translation, the expected output based on the logic in the code should be `YES`.
