The Java code you provided receives a string and outputs "ARC" if the input string is "ABC", otherwise it outputs "ABC". Here is the equivalent code written in Python:

```python
def main():
    s = input()
    print("ARC" if s == "ABC" else "ABC")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

If you want to test the code with the input "ABC", you can do so with the following test case:

```python
# Test input:
s = "ABC"

# Expected output:
# "AC"

# Function call
print("ARC" if s == "ABC" else "ABC")
```

This test will print "ARC" as that is the expected output for the input "ABC".
