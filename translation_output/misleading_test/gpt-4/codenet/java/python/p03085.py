Here's the equivalent Python code for the Java code you've provided:

```python
# Get user input
helix = input()

# DNA complement switch
complement = {
    'A': 'T',
    'T': 'A',
    'C': 'G',
    'G': 'C'
}

# Print the complement base
print(complement.get(helix, ''))
```

This code snippet reads a character from the standard input (assumed to be 'A', 'T', 'C', or 'G'), finds its complement from the dictionary, and prints the complement base.

Given the test input 'A', the expected output would indeed be 'T'.
