Below is a Python implementation of the Java code provided. The code reads pairs of integers from the standard input, calculates the remainder of a divided by b, and prints the result. Make sure you provide the input in a format similar to the test input provided (e.g., `5 8` on a single line).

```python
import sys

# Read lines from standard input
for line in sys.stdin:
    # Split the line into two parts and convert them to integers
    a, b = map(int, line.split())
    # Print the remainder of a divided by b
    print(a % b)
```

To run this code, you would need to input your test case in the stdin, followed by an end-of-file character (EOF), which is often achieved by pressing `Ctrl-D` (on Unix-like systems) or `Ctrl-Z` (on Windows) in the command line. If you're running this in an interactive Python session or within an IDE, you might need to simulate stdin or redirect from a file containing the test input.
