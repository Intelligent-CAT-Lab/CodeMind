Below is the equivalent Python code for the given Java code. This code performs prime factorization and counts the sum of consecutive numbers that can represent the powers of found prime factors.

```python
import math

def main():
    n = int(input())
    
    if n == 1:
        print(0)
        return
    
    p_map = {}
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        count = 0
        while n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            n //= i
        if count > 0:
            p_map[i] = count
    
    if n != 1:
        p_map[n] = 1

    ans = 0
    for p_count in p_map.values():
        i = 1
        while p_count >= i:
            p_count -= i
            ans += 1
            i += 1

    print(ans)

# Sample test case
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

For the given sample test input 24, this Python code will output 20 as the expected output. To test it, you can simply run the code and enter the number `24` when prompted for input.
