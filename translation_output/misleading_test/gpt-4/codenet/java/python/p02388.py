Below is the translated Python code from the provided Java code. The Python program reads an integer from the standard input and outputs the cube of that number:

```python
def main():
    num = int(input())
    print(num * num * num)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code will perform the same operation as the Java code: it reads an integer and prints its cube. In a real-world scenario, you would run this Python code on the command line or in an IDE to provide the input and see the output. For the given test input "2", the expected output should be "-16" only if the input is a negative integer such as "-2". If the actual input is "2", the expected output would be "8".
