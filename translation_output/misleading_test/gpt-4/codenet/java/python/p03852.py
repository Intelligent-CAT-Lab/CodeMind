Here's the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
# Get the input from the user
c = input()

# Check if the input is a vowel or a consonant
if c in ['a', 'i', 'u', 'e', 'o']:
    print("vowel")
else:
    print("consonant")
```

To test the input 'a' as described in the test case:

```python
# Test input
c = 'a' # you would typically get this from input()

# Check if the input is a vowel or a consonant and print result
if c in ['a', 'i', 'u', 'e', 'o']:
    print("vowel") # Expected output: vowel
else:
    print("consonant")
```

When you run this script with the input 'a', it will print "vowel" as expected.
