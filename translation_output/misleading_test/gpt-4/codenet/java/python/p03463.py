Here is the Python translation of the provided Java code:

```python
# Read input as string and split by space to get the individual numbers as strings
n, a, b = input().split()

# Convert the string inputs to integers
n = int(n)
a = int(a)
b = int(b)

# Calculate the difference between b and a
k = b - a

# Print the result based on the parity of the difference
if k % 2 == 1:
    print("Borys")
else:
    print("Alice")
```

To run a test case on this Python code, you can execute it and provide the input "5 2 4", and it should output `Borys` as per your expected output. Note, however, that the provided Java code and your expected output do not match. The Java code checks the parity of the difference between 'b' and 'a' and prints names, while the expected output seems to suggest printing characters from an array or some string transformation logic. Assuming the Java code provided was the correct algorithm, the above Python code correctly replicates its functionality.
