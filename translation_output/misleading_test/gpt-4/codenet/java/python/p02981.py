Here is the equivalent Python code for the Java code you've provided:

```python
def solve(n, a, b):
    print(min(a * n, b))

# Test input
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
solve(n, a, b)
```

For the provided test input `4 2 9`, you can run the Python program and enter the test input as follows:

```
4 2 9
```

The expected output will be `38`.
