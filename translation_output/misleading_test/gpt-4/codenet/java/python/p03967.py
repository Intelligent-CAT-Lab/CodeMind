```python
# Read input from user
top = input()
cpp = False
score = 0

# Process the input string
for char in top:
    if cpp:
        if char == 'g':
            score += 1
        cpp = False
    else:
        if char == 'p':
            score -= 1
        cpp = True

# Print the score
print(score)
```

Given the test input "gpg", the expected output is 34, which seems incorrect based on the given Java code. It looks like there's a misunderstanding of the expected output. The actual output produced by the Java code when the input is "gpg" should be 0, which is reflected in the translated Python code above. 

However, if the expected output of 34 is correct based on some different logic not present in the given Java code, additional information would be needed to accurately translate the desired functionality into Python.
