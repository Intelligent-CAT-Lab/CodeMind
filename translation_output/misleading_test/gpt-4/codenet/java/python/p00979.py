Below is the Python translation of the given Java code. Please note that in Python, we don't need to specify data types and the math operators are slightly different. For example, in Java, `&` is the bitwise AND operator, which is usually used with `|` for bitwise OR. In Python, the equivalent operators are `&` for bitwise AND and `|` for bitwise OR as well, but when checking conditions we typically use `and` and `or` respectively.

```python
import math

low = 1
high = int(math.pow(3, 32))
n = int(input())

def dfs(pos, pace):
    if pos > n:
        return 0
    # 3.0X
    if pace < high:
        npace = 3 * pace
        npos = pos + npace
        if npos == n and (npace == 1 or npace == 3):
            return 1
        else:
            temp = dfs(npos, npace)
            if temp != 0:
                return 1 + temp
    
    # 1.0X
    npace = pace
    npos = npace + pos
    if npos == n and (npace == 1 or npace == 3):
        return 1
    else:
        temp = dfs(npos, npace)
        if temp != 0:
            return 1 + temp
    
    # 0.3X
    if pace > low:
        npace = pace // 3
        npos = pos + npace
        if npos == n and (npace == 3 or npace == 1):
            return 1
        else:
            temp = dfs(npos, npace)
            if temp != 0:
                return 1 + temp

    return 0

ans = -1 if n == 0 else dfs(1, 1)
print(ans + 1)
```

Please note that I replaced the line comments and converted bitwise operators `&` to logical operators `and`. The division operator '/' for integers in Java is replaced by '//' in Python to ensure integer division. The scanner object is replaced by `input()` in Python, which returns input as a string, so the result is wrapped with `int()` to convert it to an integer.
