Here's the translated Python code using standard Python libraries:

```python
import itertools

def combinations_of_set_bits(n, k):
    for bit in range(1 << n):
        if bin(bit).count('1') != k:
            continue
        print(f"{bit}:", end="")
        for j in range(n):
            if (bit >> j) & 1:
                print(f" {j}", end="")
        print()

# Sample test case
input_string = "5 3"
n, k = map(int, input_string.split())
combinations_of_set_bits(n, k)
```

Please note that the `FastScanner` and `Methods` classes have features that are not used in the `solve` function and are therefore not translated. The translated Python code directly gets the inputs `n` and `k` without the need for a class like `FastScanner`. Furthermore, Python's built-in `bin()` function is used to count the number of '1's in the binary representation of the number.

For the sample test input `5 3` given in the Java code, you can run the provided Python function `combinations_of_set_bits(n, k)` to see the expected output. Make sure to replace `input_string` with the actual input in a real use case.
