Here is the translated Python code from the provided Java code snippet:

```python
# Read input from the user
n, k = map(int, input().split())

# Print "Yes" if the product of n and k is odd, otherwise print "No"
if (n * k) % 2 == 1:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

You can run this code and provide the test input `3 1` to get the expected output `Yes`. Please note that in Python, the print statement doesn't automatically append a new line, unlike `System.out.println` in Java, so the output will not include a trailing new line unless explicitly added. However, this is not an issue as you have stated the expected output is `Yes` without a new line.
