Here's the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
# Read the integer input
x = int(input())

# Perform the conditional check and print the result
if x % 100 <= x // 100 * 5:
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)
```

When you input `615`, the expected output would indeed be `27` if the condition asks to print `x // 100 * 5`, but in the provided Java code, the output would be either `1` or `0`. Please confirm if you want me to translate the code as it is (which gives `1` or `0`) or as how the expected output suggests.
