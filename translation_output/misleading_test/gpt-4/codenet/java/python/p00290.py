Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
# Read input from user
d, c = map(int, input().split())

# Print the product of d and c
print(d * c)
```

For a test input of `20 2`, the expected output would be `40`, not `116` as provided in the example. This Python code will multiply the two input numbers and print the result. To run the test case:

```python
# Test input
test_input = "20 2"  # You would replace this string with the actual user input

# Simulate splitting the input and mapping to integers
d, c = map(int, test_input.split())

# Perform the calculation and print
print(d * c)  # Output will be 40 for the provided test input
```

Make sure you provide the input in the correct format (two numbers separated by a space) when running the Python code.
