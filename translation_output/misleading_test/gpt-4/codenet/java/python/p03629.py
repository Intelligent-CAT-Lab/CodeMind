Below is the translation of the Java code snippet provided into Python. The Java code is written to solve a specific problem which takes a string input and processes it to output a result according to the provided algorithm.

```python
def solve(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [[[0 if k == 0 else 2 * n for k in range(2)] for j in range(26)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(26):
        dp[n][i] = [i, 1]

    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(26):
            for k in range(2):
                dp[i][j][k] = dp[i + 1][j][k]
                
        cur = ord(s[i]) - ord('a')
        mi = min(dp[i + 1][j][1] for j in range(26))
        
        for j in range(26):
            if dp[i + 1][j][1] == mi:
                dp[i][cur][0] = j
                dp[i][cur][1] = dp[i + 1][j][1] + 1
                break

    mi = min(dp[0][i][1] for i in range(26))
    cur = -1
    for i in range(26):
        if dp[0][i][1] == mi:
            cur = i
            break

    ret = chr(cur + ord('a'))
    for i in range(n):
        if dp[i][cur][0] == dp[i + 1][cur][0] and dp[i][cur][1] == dp[i + 1][cur][1]:
            continue
        ret += chr(dp[i][cur][0] + ord('a'))
        cur = dp[i][cur][0]

    return ret

# Test case
print(solve("atcoderregularcontest"))
```

Please make sure to run this code with the same input as provided in the Java code test case. This Python code uses list comprehension to build the 3-dimensional list that is equivalent to the 3-dimensional array in the original Java code and closely mirrors the logic found in the original solution.

Keep in mind that Python’s `print` function is used here instead of creating a dedicated PrintWriter class as in the Java example. Consequently, you do not have to flush the output stream explicitly; Python’s print automatically adds a newline and flushes the stream unless otherwise specified.
