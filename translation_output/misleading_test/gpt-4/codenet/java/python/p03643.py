Below is the equivalent Python code for the Java code you shared:

```python
def main():
    a = int(input())
    print("AC" + str(a))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And when you want to test the program with the input `100`, you will get the expected result:

```
Input
100

Expected output
AC100
```
