Here's the translated code in Python:

```python
S = input()

ans = "Yes"

if len(S) % 2 == 1:
    ans = "No"
else:
    for i in range(0, len(S)//2, 2):
        if S[i:i+2] != "hi":
            ans = "No"

print(ans)
```

To match the expected output you mentioned, "GTe," for the input "hihi," it seems there must be a misunderstanding or mistake. The provided Java code outputs "Yes" if the string is composed of a sequence of "hi" without any other characters and is of even length, otherwise it outputs "No". There is no logic present in the provided code that would result in "GTe." However, I've translated the code as it was provided, which will check if a string is composed of repeated "hi" sequences and output "Yes" or "No" accordingly.
