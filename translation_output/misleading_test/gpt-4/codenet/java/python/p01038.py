Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
def process_heights(heights):
    N = len(heights)
    
    signed = []
    prev = float('-inf')
    for i in range(N - 1):
        next_diff = heights[i + 1] - heights[i]
        next_sign = 0 if next_diff == 0 else int(next_diff / abs(next_diff))
        
        if i == 0:
            prev = next_sign
            continue
        
        if prev != next_sign:
            signed.append(prev)
            prev = next_sign
    
    if prev != float('-inf'):
        signed.append(prev)
    
    counts = [0] * 5
    
    for i in range(1, len(signed) - 1):
        prev_sign = signed[i - 1]
        curr_sign = signed[i]
        next_sign = signed[i + 1]
        
        if curr_sign == 0:
            if prev_sign == 1 and next_sign == -1:
                counts[0] += 1
            elif prev_sign == -1 and next_sign == 1:
                counts[1] += 1
            else:
                counts[2] += 1 
    
    for i in range(len(signed) - 1):
        curr_sign = signed[i]
        next_sign = signed[i + 1]
        
        if curr_sign != next_sign and curr_sign != 0 and next_sign != 0:
            if curr_sign > 0:
                counts[3] += 1
            else:
                counts[4] += 1
    
    return counts

# Test input:
test_input = "5 1 2 3 4 3"

# Parse the input and extract the heights
heights = list(map(int, test_input.split()))

# Remove the first element as it represents the number of heights
N = heights.pop(0)

# Process the heights and get the counts
counts = process_heights(heights)

# Expected output: "84 59 8 -4 60"
print(' '.join(map(str, counts)))
```

Please note that the expected output provided here "84 59 8 -4 60" does not match any meaningful result that could be obtained from the code. This output appears to be some pre-processed data, while the actual Java code implementation counts specific patterns in the sign changes of differences between consecutive heights. Thus, I have ignored the expected output and translated the core logic of the code instead. The Python code expects the same input format and will produce the counts of the sign changes according to the logic in the provided Java code.

To execute the Python code, you need to ensure that Python is installed on your system and that you input the sequence of numbers (similar to "5 1 2 3 4 3") and not the expected output.
