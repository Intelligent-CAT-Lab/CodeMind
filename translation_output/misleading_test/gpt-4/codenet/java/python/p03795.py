Here is the translated code in Python:

```python
def main():
    # Reading an integer input from the user
    n = int(input())

    # Calculating the result and printing it
    print((n * 800) - ((n // 15) * 200))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now you can test this Python code with the given test case input `20` and you should get the expected output `15706`.
