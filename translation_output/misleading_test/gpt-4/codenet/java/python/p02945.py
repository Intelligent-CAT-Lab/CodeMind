Below is the translated Python code.

```python
import sys

def read_ints():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

class Solver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nums = read_ints()

    def solve(self):
        a, b = self.nums
        return max(a + b, a - b, a * b)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    solver = Solver()
    print(solver.solve())
```

To run the test case with the numbers -13 and 3:

1. You should provide the input directly by typing `-13 3` when prompted after running the Python script.
2. If you want to automate the input process for testing purposes, you can use input redirection or any other form of input automation based on your environment.
