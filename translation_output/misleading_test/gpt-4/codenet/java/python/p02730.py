Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
def check_palindrome(s):
    for i in range(len(s) // 2):
        if s[i] != s[-1 - i]:
            return "No"
    for i in range(len(s) // 2 - 1):
        if s[i] != s[(len(s) // 2) - 1 - i]:
            return "No"
    return "Yes"

# Sample test case
input_string = "akasaka"
output = check_palindrome(input_string)
print(output)
```

The above Python code defines a function `check_palindrome` that runs the same checks as the Java code. The function takes a single argument `s`, which is the string to be checked. If the string is a palindrome and its first half is also a palindrome, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

Please note that, unlike in Java, we don't need to convert the string to a character array in Python, because strings are already iterable and can be accessed by index. Similarly, the output is directly printed to the console in place of using a `PrintWriter`.
