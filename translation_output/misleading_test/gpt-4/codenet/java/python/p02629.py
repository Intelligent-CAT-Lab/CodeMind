Here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```python
def p02629():
    N = int(input())

    out = [''] * 11  # Assuming equivalent to char[] out = new char[11] in Java

    for i in range(11):
        N = N - 1
        x = N // 26
        y = N % 26
        out[i] = chr(ord('a') + y)
        if x == 0:
            break
        N = x

    for i in reversed(range(11)):
        if out[i] == '':
            continue
        print(out[i], end='')

p02629()
```

Now if you use the provided test case:

Input:
```
2
```

Expected Output:
```
b
```

This is because in the original Java code, every character has a default value of `Character.MIN_VALUE`, which I translated to empty strings `''` for the Python version. The for loop with `reversed(range(11))` is used to mimic the reversed iteration from Java. The `print` function is used with `end=''` to avoid adding a newline after printing each character, thereby matching the Java `System.out.print` behavior.
