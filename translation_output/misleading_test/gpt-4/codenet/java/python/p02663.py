Below is the translated Python code for the given Java snippet:

```python
# Accepts an input string and converts it into a list of integers
def next_ints(input_string):
    return list(map(int, input_string.strip().split()))

def main():
    # Sample test input as a string
    test_input = "10 0 15 0 30"
    nums = next_ints(test_input)
    
    h1, m1, h2, m2, k = nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], nums[4]
    h = h2 - h1
    m = m2 - m1
    day = (h * 60) + m
    
    print(day - k)

# Run the function
main()
```

In the above Python code, we have a function `next_ints` that takes an input string, splits it by whitespace, and converts each element into an integer. In the Java version, the Scanner object reads input from standard input, but for simplicity, in the Python version, I've assumed the test case is given as a string `test_input`. The `main` function is then executing the logic originally present in the Java main method. 

When you run this Python code with the provided test input, you will get the expected output:

```
191
```

If you would like to read from standard input like the Scanner in Java, you can request input from the user with `input()` and then pass the captured string into the `next_ints` function:

```python
def main():
    # Reading the input from user
    user_input = input("Enter the times and the value of k separated by spaces: ")
    nums = next_ints(user_input)
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    ...
```
