Here's the translated Python code based on the Java code you provided. I've also added a sample test case at the end of the code to demonstrate how it works:

```python
def main():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print("Hello World")
    else:
        a = int(input())
        b = int(input())
        print(a + b)

# Sample test case execution
main()
```

When you run this Python code and input the number 1, it will output "Hello World" as expected. For any other number, it would prompt you to enter two additional numbers and then output their sum.
