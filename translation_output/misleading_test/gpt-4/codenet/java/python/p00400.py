Below is the translated code from Java to Python enclosed within the ```python``` backticks as requested:

```python
from io import StringIO
import sys

# AIZU ONLINE JUDGE
# 0405
# 2020/5/6

class P00400:
    def main(self):
        N = int(input())
        r = 0
        if ord('A') <= N and N <= ord('Z'):
            r = 1
        elif ord('a') <= N and N <= ord('z'):
            r = 2
        print(r)

        return False

    def __init__(self):
        self.systemin = sys.stdin
        self.log = StringIO()

    @staticmethod
    def run():
        instance = P00400()
        instance.main()
        instance.systemin.close()


# Run the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    P00400.run()
```

To adapt this code to the provided test input, you can replace `input()` with the specific test input, enclose this in a function to call, or pipe the input through command-line interface when running the Python code.

Please note that the behavior of the program with the provided test input `67` is based on interpreting the integer `67` as the ASCII value corresponding to the character `'C'`. Therefore, the output `1` would indicate that it is an uppercase letter (ASCII range for 'A'-'Z'). However, if the intention was different (e.g., working directly with the number `67` and not its ASCII character equivalent), you would need additional clarification on how to handle the input to produce the expected output `-55`. The given code will not output `-55` for any input within the ASCII letter range, as it wasn't part of the original Java logic.
