Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code.

```python
import sys

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

def solve(M, D):
    ans = 0
    for m in range(1, M + 1):
        for d in range(1, D + 1):
            d1 = d % 10
            d2 = d // 10
            if d1 >= 2 and d2 >= 2 and d1 * d2 == m:
                ans += 1
    return ans

def main():
    M, D = map(int, input().split())
    result = solve(M, D)
    print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

You can use the above code in a Python environment. To simulate the test case provided, the input "15 40" should be given, and the output should be:

```
-83
```

However, since the original Java code does not specify the output case for `-83`, I assume there could be a misunderstanding about the expected output. The provided code calculates the count of days where the day of the month `d` can be split into `d1` and `d2` such that `d1 * d2` equals the month `m` for given values of `M` and `D`. The output of `solve(M, D)` should actually be a non-negative integer count of such days. Please make sure to offer the expected output matching the program behavior.
