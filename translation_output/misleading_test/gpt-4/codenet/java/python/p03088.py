Here's the Java code translated into Python. Note that Python uses zero-based indexing, so slight adjustments are needed in the loops:

```python
mod = 1000000007

n = int(input())

dp = [[[[0 for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(n+1)]

dp[0][0][0][0] = 1

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(5):
        for k in range(5):
            for l in range(5):
                for m in range(1, 5):
                    if (j == 1 and l == 2 and m == 3) or \
                       (j == 1 and k == 2 and m == 3) or \
                       (k == 1 and l == 2 and m == 3) or \
                       (k == 1 and l == 3 and m == 2) or \
                       (k == 2 and l == 1 and m == 3):
                        continue
                    dp[i][k][l][m] = (dp[i][k][l][m] + dp[i - 1][j][k][l]) % mod

ans = 0

for i in range(1, 5):
    for j in range(1, 5):
        for k in range(1, 5):
            ans = (ans + dp[n][i][j][k]) % mod

print(ans)
```

Paste this code into your Python environment, and you should be able to run it with your test inputs. For reference, here is an example test run:

Test input:
```
3
```

Expected output:
```
-26
```

Please note that the expected output `-26` mentioned in your request seems to be incorrect or it possibly might be a typo. Running the provided code with the input `3` should not yield a negative value since we are always working with positive numbers and modulo `1000000007`.
