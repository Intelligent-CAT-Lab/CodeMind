# Since the Java code provided appears to be a part of a larger codebase and has a complex class structure,
# with dependencies that span beyond the functionality of a simple problem-solving context,
# it's challenging to provide a direct translation.
# The Java code seems to be designed as a utility library to handle a variety of mathematical operations,
# including modular arithmetic, factorial and inverse computation, as well as support for parsing and
# evaluating expressions in a simple language.
#
# Here is a Python translation of just the problem-solving logic found within the `p02990.solve` method.

This snippet contains only the functionality related to the main method inside the `p02990` class and some core modular arithmetic operations that are relevant as per the proposed usage in the Java `solve` method. The `Mod` class in Python serves as a simple utility for storing a modulus value and computing modular exponentiation and factorials.

Please note that since the Java code uses advanced features provided by `IO`, `Mod`, and `Utility` classes not included in your submission, a direct translation of those parts is not possible. Some additional conversion and adaptation have been done to ensure that the provided Python sample operates standalone. If you need to include more of the omitted features, please provide the necessary details or structural context from the codebase.
