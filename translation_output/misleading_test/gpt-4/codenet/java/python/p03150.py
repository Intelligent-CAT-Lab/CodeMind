Here's the given Java code translated to Python:

```python
def check(s):
    if s == "keyence":
        return True
    else:
        for i in range(len(s)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
                str_ = s[:i] + s[j:]
                if str_ == "keyence":
                    return True
    return False

# Test case input
s = input()  # Enter "keyofscience" during execution to match the example
if check(s):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

Please note that while the original Java code named the method `check`, in Python functions are usually named with lower_case_with_underscores as per PEP 8 guidelines. I retained the original name for parity with the question.

For the provided test input "keyofscience", you can test the Python code to obtain the expected output "NO". If you enter "keyence" you will get "YES", indicating the key string was found.
