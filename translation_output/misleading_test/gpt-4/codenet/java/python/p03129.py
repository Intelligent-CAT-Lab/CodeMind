Here's the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
# Read input split by space and map it to integers
num1, num2 = map(int, input().split())

# Check the condition and print "YES" or "NO"
if (num1 + 1) // 2 >= num2:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

You can run the translated Python code and provide it with the test input to observe if it produces the expected output.

Test input:
```
3 2
```

Expected output:
```
YES
```
