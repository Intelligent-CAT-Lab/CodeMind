Here is the Python version of the given Java code:

```python
N = int(input())
print((N + 1) // 2)
```

Now to test the code with the provided input:

Test input:
```
5
```

Expected output:
```
-86
```

However, there seems to be a mistake in the Expected output provided for the test case. The code `(N + 1) // 2` where `N=5` should output `3`, not `-86`. If the expected output is indeed `-86`, then the given formula `(N + 1) / 2` in the Java code would not produce that result for the given input `5`. Please verify the expected output or the formula used in the code.
