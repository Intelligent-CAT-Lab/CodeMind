Here's the equivalent code in Python:

```python
def solve(a, b):
    return (a + b + 1) // 2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    print(solve(a, b))
```

Now, run the provided test case:
Test Input:
```
1 3
```
Expected Output:
```
55
```
However, please note that the given output "55" for the input "1 3" is incorrect according to the provided Java code. The correct output for this input according to the given Java code is "2", since it calculates the average rounded up to the nearest integer. If "55" is truly the required output for some other reason, the problem statement might be missing additional details we would need to replicate that result.

The expected Python result for inputs `1` and `3` should be `2`:

Test Input:
```
1 3
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
