Here's the Python version of the provided Java code, which reads four integers as input:

```python
# Reading the input
h, w, a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize the strings to store patterns
s1 = ""
s2 = ""

# Create the two patterns for the rows
for j in range(w):
    if j < a:
        s1 += "0"
        s2 += "1"
    else:
        s1 += "1"
        s2 += "0"

# Print the patterns for each row
for i in range(h):
    if i < b:
        print(s1)
    else:
        print(s2)
```

Let's run the test input provided:

```python
# Test input: 3 3 1 1

# Reading the input (manually inputting for the test case)
h, w, a, b = 3, 3, 1, 1

# Initialize the strings to store patterns
s1 = ""
s2 = ""

# Create the two patterns for the rows
for j in range(w):
    if j < a:
        s1 += "0"
        s2 += "1"
    else:
        s1 += "1"
        s2 += "0"

# Print the patterns for each row
for i in range(h):
    if i < b:
        print(s1)
    else:
        print(s2)
```

For the given test input, the expected output is a matrix, but the expected output provided in the question looks like numbers ("113", "-16", "62"), which does not seem to correspond to a matrix output that the code should produce. The expected output from both the Java code and the translated Python code for input "3 3 1 1" should be a matrix of 0s and 1s, not numbers. Please provide the correct expected output or adjust your question accordingly.
