Here's the translation of the Java code to Python:

```python
# Read two integers from input
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the result and print it
print((n-1)*(m-1))
```

To run a test case with the input `3 4` and get the expected output `96`, you would execute the Python code and provide the input as follows:

```plaintext
3 4
```

Then the output would be:

```plaintext
96
```
