Here's the translated Python code for the Java code you provided:

```python
MOD = 1000000007
fact = [1] * 1000001
ifact = [1] * 1000001

# Precompute factorials and inverse factorials
def precompute():
    for i in range(2, len(fact)):
        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % MOD
        ifact[i] = pow(fact[i], MOD - 2, MOD)

precompute()

# Function for computing nCr mod MOD
def comb(n, r):
    if r < 0 or r > n:
        return 0
    return fact[n] * ifact[r] * ifact[n - r] % MOD

# Solve the problem for a given integer i
def solve(i):
    md = [0] * i
    rm = i - 2
    lx = i - 2
    while rm >= 0:
        md[lx + 1] = comb(rm, lx)
        rm -= 2
        lx -= 1

    res = 0
    prev = 0
    for m in range(1, i):
        cur = fact[m] * fact[i - m - 1] % MOD
        cur = cur * md[m] % MOD

        res += (cur - prev + MOD) * m % MOD
        prev = cur

    return res % MOD

# Sample Test
input_value = 4
print(solve(input_value))  # Output: -29, which is incorrectâ€”Python does not have negative modulus
```

However, the following point must be corrected. The expected output "-29" is incorrect because, in Python, the modulus of a number is never negative. Modulus operation always yields a non-negative result. Thus, the expected output must be a non-negative residue modulo `MOD`.

Let's correct the final output line in the original Java code: it is taking modulo `M07` (`MOD` in our Python code), which suggests the output should not be negative. Therefore, it should be consistent with Python's behavior.

So the expected output in your test case for Python should be equivalent to `(result % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, where `result` is the original result. This ensures a non-negative output. Please make sure the expected output follows this rule when comparing the results in Python.
