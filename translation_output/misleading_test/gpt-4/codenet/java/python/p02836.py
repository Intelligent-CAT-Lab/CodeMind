Below is the Python translation of the provided Java code:

```python
def calculate_mismatches(s):
    length = len(s)
    count = 0

    for i in range(length // 2):
        a = s[i]
        b = s[length - 1 - i]
        if a != b:
            count += 1
            
    return count

# Test input
input_string = "redcoder"
# Expected output: 44

# Calculate mismatches and print result
mismatches = calculate_mismatches(input_string)
print(mismatches)
```

In the Python version, I wrapped the logic in a function for more modular code. When you run this, it should output the expected result for the given test input:

```python
# Test input:
input_string = "redcoder"

# Expected output:
44
```

It is clear that the expected output value of 44 mentioned here is a mistake because the expected output should be the count of the positions where characters do not match when comparing the string to its reverse. The correct expected output from the given input `redcoder` should actually be 2, as only 2 characters differ between the string and its reverse ('r' with 'e' and 'd' with 'o') when comparing each pair of characters.
