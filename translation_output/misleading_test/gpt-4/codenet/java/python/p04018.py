This Python code is the translated version of the provided Java code, with necessary adjustments to match Python syntax and conventions. It implements the same KMP preprocessing algorithm and logic to solve the provided problem. The Java `Task` class method `solve` has become a regular function, and the `answer` function has been created to match the `answer` method from the Java class, albeit with print statements in place of appending to an `StringBuilder`.

Note: The Java code contains additional classes such as `FastIO` and `Debug` that are used for fast input/output operations and debugging, which are not necessary in Python because its input/output operations are sufficiently concise and efficient for this example. Any reference to these classes has been omitted because Python provides its own built-in functions like `print` for output and can use `input` for reading from standard input.
