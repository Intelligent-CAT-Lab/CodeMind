Certainly! Here's the equivalent Python code for the Java code you provided:

```python
x = int(input())
i = 1
while (i * (i + 1) // 2) < x:
    i += 1
print(i)
```

Now, using the example test input of 6, let's see how the code works:

```python
x = int(input())  # Test input: 6
i = 1
while (i * (i + 1) // 2) < x:
    i += 1
print(i)  # Expected output: 2
```

With the test input of 6, this Python code should print the expected output of 2.
