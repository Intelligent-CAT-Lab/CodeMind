Here is the translated Python code:

```python
import sys

class p02634:
    def __init__(self, MOD=998244353):
        self.MOD = MOD

    def calc(self, A, B, C, D):
        cell = [[0 for _ in range(D)] for _ in range(C)]
        cell[A - 1][B - 1] = 1
        for i in range(A, C):
            cell[i][B - 1] = cell[i - 1][B - 1] * B % self.MOD
        for i in range(B, D):
            cell[A - 1][i] = cell[A - 1][i - 1] * A % self.MOD

        for i in range(A, C):
            for j in range(B, D):
                cell[i][j] = cell[i - 1][j] * j % self.MOD
                cell[i][j] += cell[i][j - 1] * i % self.MOD
                cell[i][j] %= self.MOD
                val = cell[i - 1][j - 1] * i % self.MOD * j % self.MOD
                cell[i][j] += self.MOD - val
                cell[i][j] %= self.MOD
                cell[i][j] += cell[i - 1][j] + cell[i][j - 1]
                cell[i][j] %= self.MOD

        return cell[C - 1][D - 1]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reader = sys.stdin.buffer
    tokens = reader.read().decode('utf8').split()
    A, B, C, D = map(int, tokens)
    instance = p02634()
    result = instance.calc(A, B, C, D)
    print(result)
```

You can run this translated Python program and provide it with the input as specified. To execute the test case as mentioned in the question, you would run the program and input `1 1 2 2` followed by an enter to get `-64` as output (considering the input is provided in the same way as the original Java code expects). Note that `-64` is unexpected due to the modulo operation, so the actual output should be a positive value within the range of `0` to `MOD-1`. If `-64` is indeed the result in your test case, it might indicate an issue with the original Java code or a misunderstanding in the expected result. Python and Java handle negative modulo differently which could lead to different results; in Python, the result of `x % MOD` is always non-negative if `MOD` is positive.
