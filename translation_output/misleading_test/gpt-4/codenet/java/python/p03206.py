Certainly! Below is the provided Java code converted into Python:

```python
D = int(input())
if D == 25:
    print("Christmas")
if D == 24:
    print("Christmas Eve")
if D == 23:
    print("Christmas Eve Eve")
if D == 22:
    print("Christmas Eve Eve Eve")
```

You can use this Python script to achieve the same result as the given Java code. When you provide `25` as input, it will print "Christmas".
