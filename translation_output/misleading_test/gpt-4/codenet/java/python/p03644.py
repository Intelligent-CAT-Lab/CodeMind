Below is the translated Python code that performs the same function as the provided Java code. The Python code reads an integer from the input, counts to the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to that number, and prints the result.

```python
def count(pnum):
    result = 0
    for i in range(pnum):
        if 2**i <= pnum:
            result = 2**i
        else:
            break
    return result

# Read input from user
pnum = int(input())

# Calculate and print the result using the count function
print(count(pnum))
```

For the test input 7, this code will produce the expected output of 80 (though, note that from the `count` function, it seems like the expected output is incorrect, as the function actually finds the greatest power of 2 less than or equal to the input, which would be 4 for the input 7 and not 80). If 80 is indeed the expected output for input 7, then the Java code might be solving a different problem or not functioning as intended.
