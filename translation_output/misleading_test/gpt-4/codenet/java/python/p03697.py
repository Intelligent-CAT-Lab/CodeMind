Here's the Java code translated into Python:

```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())

if a + b >= 10:
    print("error")
else:
    print(a + b)
```

To run the code with the test input provided, you can execute it like this:

```python
# Test input
test_input = "6 3"

# Split the input and convert to integers
a, b = map(int, test_input.split())

# Conditional block to check the sum
if a + b >= 10:
    print("error")
else:
    print(a + b)
```

Running the above code snippet with the test input "6 3" will print "-30", but since that does not match the logic of the given Java code which would print "9", it seems there is a mistake in the expected output you provided. The Java code would print "9" for the input "6 3", and so would the translated Python code above.
