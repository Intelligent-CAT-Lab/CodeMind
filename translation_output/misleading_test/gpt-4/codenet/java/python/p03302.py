Below is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
# Read the input values
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Check the conditions and print the result
if a + b == 15:
    print("+")
elif a * b == 15:
    print("*")
else:
    print("x")
```

This Python code will read two integers from the input, separated by a space, perform the same checks as the Java code, and print the corresponding symbol.
