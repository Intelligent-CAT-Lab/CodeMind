Here's the equivalent Python code that performs the same task as the provided Java code:

```python
import sys

def solve():
    n, d1, d2 = map(int, input().split())
    d1s = d2s = 0
    while d1 & 3 == 0:
        d1s += 1
        d1 >>= 2
    while d2 & 3 == 0:
        d2s += 1
        d2 >>= 2
    need = n * n
    for i in range(2 * n):
        for j in range(2 * n):
            if (d1 & 3) == 1 and (((i >> d1s) ^ (j >> d1s)) & 1) != 0:
                continue
            if (d1 & 3) == 2 and ((i >> d1s) & 1) != 0:
                continue
            if (d2 & 3) == 1 and (((i >> d2s) ^ (j >> d2s)) & 1) != 0:
                continue
            if (d2 & 3) == 2 and ((i >> d2s) & 1) != 0:
                continue
            print(i, j)
            need -= 1
            if need == 0:
                return
    raise AssertionError()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

To run the Python version, you would also supply the test input in the same way as for the Java version, but the scripts would be run using a Python interpreter instead of a Java compiler and runtime.

For example, for the given test input (`2 1 2`), running this Python script would produce:

```
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
```
