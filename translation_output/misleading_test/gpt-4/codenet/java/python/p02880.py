Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
N = int(input())
f = False
for A in range(1, 10):
    if N % A == 0 and N // A < 10:
        f = True

ret = 'Yes' if f else 'No'
print(ret)
```

When you give it an input of `10`, the expected output should be `'Yes'`, which signifies that the value of `N` can be expressed as a product of two integers in the range 1-9 inclusive.
