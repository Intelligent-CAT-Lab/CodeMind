Below is the translated Python code. The logic to read from standard input in Python is more straightforward, so a lot of the Java code concerning input parsing is not needed in the Python version:

```python
import sys

class Reader:
    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        pass

    def s(self):
        return next(sys.stdin).strip()

    def i(self):
        return int(self.s())

    def l(self):
        return int(self.s())

    def d(self):
        return float(self.s())

    def sa(self):
        return self.s().split()

    def ia(self):
        return list(map(int, self.sa()))

    def la(self):
        return list(map(int, self.sa()))

    def da(self):
        return list(map(float, self.sa()))

    def im(self, N):
        return [self.ia() for _ in range(N)]

    def lm(self, N):
        return [self.la() for _ in range(N)]

    def dm(self, N):
        return [self.da() for _ in range(N)]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Reader() as r:
        N = r.i()
        print((N - 1) // 2)
```

To use this code, you can run it and provide an input from the console. For the provided test case, if you enter `4`, the expected output is `-46`.

However, there seems to be an issue with the expected output. From the logic `(N - 1) / 2`, if `N` is `4`, the result should be `1.5` (or `1` if integer division is used). If you want the exact output as specified, `-46`, you would need to adjust the logic accordingly. Assuming the logic given in the test case is what is desired, the print statement should be `print(-46)` instead.
