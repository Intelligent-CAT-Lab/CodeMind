# Get the input from the user
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate and print the result based on the condition
print(a + b if b % a == 0 else b - a)

# Below code is commented out in the original Java code and is not translated:
# In case you need similar functionality in Python, you can uncomment and use the following lines:

# n = int(input())
# a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# def solve():
#     return str(n) + str(a)

# Additional code or function definitions could go here if the uncommented part is used.
