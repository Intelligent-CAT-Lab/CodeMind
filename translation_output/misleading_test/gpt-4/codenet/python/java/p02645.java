Below is the translation of the Python code into Java. This program reads a line from the console and prints the first three characters of the string:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        String output = input.length() >= 3 ? input.substring(0, 3) : input;
        System.out.println(output);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

For the provided test input "takahashi", if you run this Java program it should produce the expected output "tak", just as the original Python code would print the first three characters of the input string. Please note that the Python code provided will only print the first three characters, thus I assumed that it is the expected behavior and not the "t>z" that is in the Expected output section, which seems to be a mistake. If "t>z" is indeed the expected output for some specific logic, please provide the corresponding details for that logic, and I could adjust the Java code accordingly.
