Here's the translated Python code into Java code, along with a sample test case:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int M = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(48 - M);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This Java program will read an integer from the input and print `48 - M`, where `M` is the input integer. To run this code with a test input of 21 and get the expected output of 39, you would compile and run it in a Java environment, providing 21 as the input when prompted.
