Certainly! Here is the Python code snippet translated into Java:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class NewYearFormatter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the date:");
        String input = scanner.nextLine(); // Read the input date from the user
        String formattedDate = "2018" + input.substring(4); // Replace the year part and keep the rest of the date unchanged
        System.out.println(formattedDate); // Print the formatted date
        scanner.close(); // Close the scanner
    }
}
```

The Java code adds the "2018" in front of the substring extracted from the input starting at index 4, which includes the forward slash and everything after that. Note that the input prompt and scanner close are typically good practices in Java to handle user inputs and resource management, respectively.

When you run this Java program, it will prompt you to enter a date. You would input "2017/01/07" and the expected output would be "2018/01/07" as it would replace the first four characters of your input date with "2018".
