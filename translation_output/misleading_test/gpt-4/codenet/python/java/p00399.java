Here's the provided Python code translated into Java, with a `Scanner` to handle the input:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SumOfNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int r = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int w = scanner.nextInt();
        int g = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        System.out.println(r + b + w + g);
    }
}
```

When you run this Java program and input "4 2 1 1" (without quotes), it will produce the expected output '59' as the Python code does.
