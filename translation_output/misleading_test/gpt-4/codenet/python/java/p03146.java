Here's the translated code from Python to Java:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.HashSet;

public class CollatzConjecture {
    private static int s;
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        s = scanner.nextInt();
        solve();
        scanner.close();
    }
    
    private static void solve() {
        int m = 1;
        long pre = s;
        HashSet<Long> st = new HashSet<>();
        st.add(pre);
        
        while (true) {
            m += 1;
            if (pre % 2 == 0)
                pre /= 2;
            else
                pre = 3 * pre + 1;
            
            if (st.contains(pre)) {
                System.out.println(-m);
                return;
            }
            
            st.add(pre);
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that for this translation, I made the following assumptions:

1. The original Python code seems to contain unnecessary imports and code that's commented out, which I've omitted in the Java translation.
2. The original Python code does not actually print `m`, but rather just the variable name `m`, I assumed the expected behavior is to print the negative value of `m`.
3. I've not set a higher recursion limit since Java does not have such an option through standard runtime functions and stack size is typically specified as a VM argument.
4. I've used a `HashSet` in Java to represent the set `st` in Python because it's a structure that allows constant-time complexity for the `contains` and `add` operations, very similar to the Python set.
5. The `solve` method is made static and accepts no arguments because it operates only on the static member `s`.
6. The input/output sections are replaced with `Scanner` in Java for standard input handling.
