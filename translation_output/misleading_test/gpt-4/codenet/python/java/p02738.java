Here's the Java translation of the Python code provided, which implements numpy-like behaviors and the computation requested:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.math.BigInteger;

public class NumpyLikeImplementation {
    private static final int MAX = (int) 3e6;
    private static BigInteger[] d = new BigInteger[MAX];

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int M = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        int l = n * 3 + 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < d.length; i++) {
            d[i] = BigInteger.ZERO;
        }
        d[0] = BigInteger.ONE;

        for (int i = 1; i < l; i++) {
            int j = i - 1, k = i - 2;
            d[i] = roll(d[k].multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(k)).add(roll(d[j], -1).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(j))), -1).add(roll(d[j], 1));
            d[i] = d[i].mod(BigInteger.valueOf(M));
        }

        BigInteger sum = BigInteger.ZERO;
        for (int i = 0; i < l; i++) {
            sum = sum.add(d[l - 1].shiftRight(l - i - 1).and(BigInteger.ONE));
        }

        System.out.println(sum.mod(BigInteger.valueOf(M)));
    }

    private static BigInteger roll(BigInteger number, int amount) {
        if (amount == 1) {
            return number.shiftLeft(1).or(number.shiftRight(d.length - 1));
        } else if (amount == -1) {
            return number.shiftRight(1).or(number.shiftLeft(d.length - 1).and(BigInteger.ONE));
        }
        return number;
    }
}
```

Explanation of changes made while translating the code:

1. In Java, it is common to use classes and static methods, and Java does not have `numpy` like Python; thus, I've created a main class `NumpyLikeImplementation` with a main method.

2. Reading from the console is done using a `Scanner` rather than Python's `input()` function.

3. I used `BigInteger` from `java.math` package to handle large integer calculations and modulo operations, mimicking numpy's `int64` dtype.

4. I didn't create a direct equivalent of a numpy array in Java. Instead, I used a one-dimensional array of `BigInteger` to hold the values.

5. The `roll()` function was manually implemented to mimic the behavior of numpy's `roll` function, with specific cases for rolling by one position to the right or left; other amounts are not implemented since the original code does not use them.

6. Array indexing starts from 0 in Java, so some adjustments are made in accessing the elements of the array.

7. The final sum calculation iterates through the bits of the last BigInteger element in the array to compute the sum of binary ones.

Please note:

- Depending on the exact behavior expected from the original code, especially regarding the `roll()` function and the summing at the end, further refinements or adjustments to the logic may be necessary. The Python code was using numpy features that don't have direct counterparts in Java, so I made assumptions based on the provided example.

- The original numpy code is highly optimized for mathematical operations on arrays, especially those of a numeric nature. The translated Java code may not achieve similar performance due to manual implementation of numpy functions and the nature of BigInteger arithmetic.
