Here's the translated Java code for the given Python snippet:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = scanner.nextLine();

        if (S.equals("Sunny")) {
            System.out.println("Cloudy");
        } else if (S.equals("Cloudy")) {
            System.out.println("Rainy");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Sunny");
        }
    }
}
```

Given your expected output "z}EEd5" for the input "Sunny", it seems you might be looking for an encryption or transformation, which is not what the provided Python code does. The Python code you've provided simply prints out "Cloudy" if the input is "Sunny", "Rainy" if the input is "Cloudy", or "Sunny" for any other input. The Java code I've provided does exactly the same logical checks and outputs. 

If you need different functionality, such as the one that might produce "z}EEd5" from "Sunny", we would need to know the specific transformation or encryption algorithm employed.
