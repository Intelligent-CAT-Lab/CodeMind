Below is the Java equivalent of the provided Python code which takes user input, checks the last letter, and appends either "es" or "s" accordingly. Please note that in Java, we need to use the `Scanner` class for input, and the syntax is more verbose compared to Python.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        if (s.endsWith("s")) {
            System.out.println(s + "es");
        } else {
            System.out.println(s + "s");
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

Test this Java code with the input "apple", and it will output "apples" as expected.

Please note that the expected output you provided ("aTplVN") does not match the Python code's logic. The code you shared simply appends an "es" if the last character is 's', or "s" if otherwise. The given expected output seems unrelated to the code's functionality.
