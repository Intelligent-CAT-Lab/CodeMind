<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
8 3

Expected output:
92.98921496973458

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import math
from bisect import bisect_right as br
from bisect import bisect_left as bl
sys.setrecursionlimit(2147483647)
from heapq import heappush, heappop,heappushpop
from collections import defaultdict
from itertools import accumulate
from collections import Counter
from collections import deque
from operator import itemgetter
from itertools import permutations
mod = 10**9 + 7
inf = float('inf')
def I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())
def LI(): return list(map(int,sys.stdin.readline().split()))

t,x = LI()
print(t/x)
```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = scanner.nextInt();
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println((double)t/x);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the standard input, divides the first by the second, and prints the result. The division is performed as a floating-point division, so the result is a double.
