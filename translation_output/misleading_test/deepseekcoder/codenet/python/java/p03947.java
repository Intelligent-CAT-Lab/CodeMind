<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
BBBWW

Expected output:
-85

```
S = input()
ans = 0
for i in range(len(S)-1):
    if S[i] != S[i+1]:
        ans += 1
print(ans)

```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = scanner.next();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < S.length() - 1; i++) {
            if (S.charAt(i) != S.charAt(i + 1)) {
                ans += 1;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a string from the input, then iterates over the string, comparing each character with the next one. If they are different, it increments the counter. Finally, it prints the counter.
