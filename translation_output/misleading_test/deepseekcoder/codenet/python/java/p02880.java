<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
10

Expected output:
es

```
N=int(input())
for i in range(1,10):
    for j in range(1,10):
        if(i*j==N):
            print('Yes')
            exit()
print('No')
```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of the Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
                if (i * j == N) {
                    System.out.println("Yes");
                    System.exit(0);
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println("No");
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer from the input, and then checks if there are any two numbers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) that multiply to that number. If it finds such numbers, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
