<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
100 25

Expected output:
156

```
a1 , a2 = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
t = 0
if a1 == 1 and a2 == 1 :
    print ( 0 )
else :
    while a1 > 0 and a2 > 0 :
        if a1 > a2 :
            a2 += 1
            a1 -= 2
        else :
            a2 -= 2
            a1 += 1
        t += 1
    print ( t )


```

### Response:
Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int a2 = scanner.nextInt();
        int t = 0;

        if (a1 == 1 && a2 == 1) {
            System.out.println(0);
        } else {
            while (a1 > 0 && a2 > 0) {
                if (a1 > a2) {
                    a2 += 1;
                    a1 -= 2;
                } else {
                    a2 -= 2;
                    a1 += 1;
                }
                t += 1;
            }
            System.out.println(t);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the input, and then it enters a loop where it alternates between subtracting 2 from the first variable and adding 1 to the second variable, until one of the variables becomes 0. The number of iterations is counted and printed out.
