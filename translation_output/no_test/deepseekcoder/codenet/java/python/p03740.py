<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.

### Instruction:
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.Scanner;
public class p03740 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
		try{
			Scanner sc  = new Scanner(System.in);
			System.out.println(Math.abs(sc.nextLong() - sc.nextLong()) <= 1 ? "Brown" : "Alice");
		}catch(Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}
```

### Response:
```python
import sys

def main():
    try:
        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        print("Brown" if abs(a - b) <= 1 else "Alice")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the standard input, calculates their absolute difference, and prints "Brown" if the difference is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it prints "Alice". If an exception occurs, it prints the exception.
