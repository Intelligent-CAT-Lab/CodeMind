Translate the above python code to java.

java Code:

[/INST]

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a character: ");
        char input = scanner.next().charAt(0);
        System.out.println((char) (input + 1));
    }
}
```

Explanation:

* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `next()` method is used to read the next token from the input stream.
* The `charAt()` method is used to get the character at a specific index in the input string.
* The `(char) (input + 1)` expression is used to increment the character by 1.
* The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the result to the console.</s>
