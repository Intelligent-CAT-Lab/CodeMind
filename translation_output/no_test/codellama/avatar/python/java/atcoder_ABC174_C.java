python Code:

import sys
from collections import defaultdict
K = int ( input ( ) )
cnt = 0
now = 0
if K % 2 == 0 :
    print ( - 1 )
    sys . exit ( 0 )
for i in range ( 10 ** 6 ) :
    cnt += 1
    now = ( now * 10 + 7 ) % K
    if now == 0 :
        print ( cnt )
        sys . exit ( 0 )
print ( - 1 )



Translate the above python code to java.

java Code:

[/INST]

import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Collections;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int K = sc.nextInt();
        int cnt = 0;
        int now = 0;
        if (K % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println(-1);
            return;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            cnt++;
            now = (now * 10 + 7) % K;
            if (now == 0) {
                System.out.println(cnt);
                return;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(-1);
    }
}

Note: The above code is written in Java 8, and it uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `Collections` class to create a `defaultdict` object. The `defaultdict` object is used to store the count of the number of times the loop runs before the value of `now` becomes 0. The `if` statement checks if the value of `K` is even, and if it is, it prints -1 and exits the program. The `for` loop runs for 1000000 iterations, and it increments the value of `cnt` each time. The `now` variable is updated by multiplying it by 10 and adding 7, and then taking the remainder of the result with `K`. If the value of `now` becomes 0, the loop exits and the value of `cnt` is printed. If the loop runs for 1000000 iterations without finding a value of `now` that is 0, the program prints -1 and exits.</s>
