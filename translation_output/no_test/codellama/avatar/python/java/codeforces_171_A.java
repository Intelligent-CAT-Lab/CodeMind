python Code:

a , b = input ( ) . split ( ) ; b = int ( b [ : : - 1 ] ) ; print ( int ( a ) + b )



Translate the above python code to java.

java Code:

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        String[] numbers = input.split(" ");
        int a = Integer.parseInt(numbers[0]);
        int b = Integer.parseInt(numbers[1]);
        System.out.println(a + b);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `nextLine()` method is used to read a line of input from the user.
* The `split()` method is used to split the input string into two parts, separated by a space.
* The `parseInt()` method is used to convert the two parts of the input string into integers.
* The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the sum of the two integers.

Note: The Python code uses the `input()` function to read a line of input from the user, and the `split()` method to split the input string into two parts, separated by a space. The Java code uses the `Scanner` class to read a line of input from the user, and the `split()` method to split the input string into two parts, separated by a space.</s>
