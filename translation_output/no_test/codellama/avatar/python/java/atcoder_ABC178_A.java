python Code:

x = int ( input ( ) )
if x == 1 :
    print ( 0 )
else :
    print ( 1 )



Translate the above python code to java.

java Code:

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        if (x == 1) {
            System.out.println(0);
        } else {
            System.out.println(1);
        }
    }
}
```

Note that the `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user, and the `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer value from the user. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the output to the console.</s>
