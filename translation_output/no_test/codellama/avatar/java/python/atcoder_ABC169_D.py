java Code:

import java.util.*;

public class atcoder_ABC169_D {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long N = sc.nextLong();
        List<Integer> factors = primeFactor(N);
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < factors.size(); i++) {
            int pow = factors.get(i);
            int increase = 1;
            while (pow - increase >= 0) {
                pow -= increase;
                increase++;
                count++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }

    static List<Integer> primeFactor(long N) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for (long i = 2; i * i <= N; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            while (N % i == 0) {
                N /= i;
                count++;
            }
            if (count != 0)
                res.add(count);
        }
        if (N != 1) {
            res.add(1);
        }
        return res;
    }
}

Translate the above java code to python.

python Code:

[/INST]
```python
import math

def prime_factor(n):
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        count = 0
        while n % i == 0:
            n //= i
            count += 1
        if count != 0:
            factors.append(count)
    if n != 1:
        factors.append(1)
    return factors

def main():
    n = int(input())
    factors = prime_factor(n)
    count = 0
    for pow, increase in enumerate(factors):
        while pow - increase >= 0:
            pow -= increase
            increase += 1
            count += 1
    print(count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This is the Python code for the same problem. It uses the same approach as the Java code, but with some differences in syntax and implementation.

The `prime_factor` function is similar to the `primeFactor` function in the Java code, but it uses a different approach to find the prime factors of a number. In this function, we iterate from 2 to the square root of the number, and for each prime factor `i`, we count the number of times it divides the number. If the count is not 0, we add it to the list of factors.

The `main` function is similar to the `main` function in the Java code, but it uses a different approach to calculate the number of factors. In this function, we first find the prime factors of the number using the `prime_factor` function. Then, we iterate over the list of factors, and for each factor `pow`, we calculate the number of factors that can be obtained by increasing the power of the factor by 1. We add the number of factors to the total count.

Finally, we print the total count of factors.</s>
