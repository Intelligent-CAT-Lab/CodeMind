java Code:

import java.util.*;

public class atcoder_ABC043_B {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        
        while (s.contains("0B ") || s.contains("1B ")) {
            s = s.replaceAll("0B ", "");
            s = s.replaceAll("1B ", "");
        }
        
        s = s.replaceAll(" B ", "");
        
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}

Translate the above java code to python.

python Code:

[/INST]
```python
import re

s = input()

while "0B " in s or "1B " in s:
    s = s.replace("0B ", "")
    s = s.replace("1B ", "")

s = re.sub(" B ", "", s)

print(s)
```
This is the equivalent Python code for the given Java code. The `re` module is used for regular expression operations, which is similar to the `replaceAll()` method in Java. The `input()` function is used to read a string from the user, and the `print()` function is used to print the resulting string. The `while` loop is used to repeatedly replace all occurrences of "0B " and "1B " with an empty string, and then replace all occurrences of " B " with an empty string.</s>
