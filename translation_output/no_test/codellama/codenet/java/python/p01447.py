java code:

import java.util.Scanner;
 
 
public class p01447{
     
    public static void main(String[] args){
    	
    	final Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    	
    	long n = sc.nextLong();
    	int count = 0;
    	
    	while(n > 1){
    		n  = (n + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 3 - n % 3)) / 3;
    		count++;
    	}
    	
    	System.out.println(count);
    	
    }
     
}

Translate the above java code to python.

python code:

[/INST]
```
import math

n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
count = 0

while n > 1:
    n = (n + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 3 - n % 3)) / 3
    count += 1

print(count)
```
This code uses the same logic as the Java code, but it is written in Python. It uses the `input()` function to get the user's input, and then it uses a `while` loop to repeatedly divide the number by 3 and increment the count until the number is less than or equal to 1. Finally, it prints the count.

Note that the `n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 3 - n % 3` part of the code is a ternary operator that is used to check if the number is divisible by 3. If it is, it returns 0, otherwise it returns 3 minus the number modulo 3. This is used to ensure that the number is always divisible by 3, which is necessary for the algorithm to work.</s>
