Translate the above java code to python.

python code:

[/INST]
```python
import sys

class p02534:
    def __init__(self, sc):
        self.sc = sc
        self.K = sc.nextInt()

    def solve(self):
        answer = ""
        for i in range(self.K):
            answer += "ACL"
        return answer

    def show(self, answer):
        print(answer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sc = sys.stdin
    p02534(sc).show(p02534(sc).solve())
```
This is a Python implementation of the Java code you provided. It uses the `sys` module to read input from the standard input stream, and the `range` function to iterate over the numbers from 0 to `K`. The `show` method is used to print the solution to the standard output stream.

Note that the `p02534` class is defined with a constructor that takes a `Scanner` object as an argument, and the `solve` and `show` methods are defined as instance methods. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to run the program as a script, and the `p02534` class is instantiated and the `show` method is called on it.</s>
