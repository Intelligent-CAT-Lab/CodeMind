<s> [INST] <<SYS>>
You are an expert python programmer and assistant
<</SYS>>

java code:

import java.util.*;
import java.math.*;

class p02477{
	public static void main(String Args[]){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String str = sc.next();
		BigInteger A = new BigInteger(str);
		str = sc.next();
		BigInteger B = new BigInteger(str);
		System.out.println(A.multiply(B));
	}
}



Translate the above java code to python.

python code:

[/INST]
```
import sys
import math

def main():
    A = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    B = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    print(A * B)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This is a simple program that reads two integers from standard input, multiplies them, and prints the result.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

* `import sys`: This line imports the `sys` module, which provides access to the standard input and output streams.
* `import math`: This line imports the `math` module, which provides access to mathematical functions.
* `def main():`: This line defines a function called `main`.
* `A = int(sys.stdin.readline())`: This line reads a line of input from standard input and converts it to an integer using the `int` function.
* `B = int(sys.stdin.readline())`: This line reads another line of input from standard input and converts it to an integer using the `int` function.
* `print(A * B)`: This line multiplies `A` and `B` and prints the result.
* `if __name__ == "__main__":`: This line checks whether the script is being run directly (i.e., not imported as a module) and, if so, calls the `main` function.

Note that the `sys` module provides access to the standard input and output streams, which are used to read and write data to the console. The `math` module provides access to mathematical functions, which are used to perform mathematical operations in the program.</s>
