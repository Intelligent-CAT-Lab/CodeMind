Translate the above java code to python.

python code:

[/INST]
```python
import sys

def solve():
    n = int(input())
    ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    dfs(0, n, 1, ret)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            print(ret[i][j], end=" ")
        print()

def dfs(left, right, level, ret):
    if left + 1 >= right:
        return
    center = (left + right) // 2
    for i in range(left, center):
        for j in range(center, right):
            ret[i][j] = level
            ret[j][j] = level
    dfs(left, center, level + 1, ret)
    dfs(center, right, level + 1, ret)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()

This is the Python translation of the Java code. The `solve()` function is the same as the `solve()` function in the Java code, and it uses the `dfs()` function to perform the depth-first search. The `dfs()` function is also the same as the `dfs()` function in the Java code, and it uses the `ret` array to store the results of the depth-first search.

The `main()` function is also the same as the `main()` function in the Java code, and it uses the `solve()` function to solve the problem.

The `tr()` function is not present in the Python code, as it is not needed for the solution.
