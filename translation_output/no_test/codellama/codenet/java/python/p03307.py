java code:

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class p03307 {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
        System.out.println(problem102a(n));
    }

    private static int problem102a(int n) {
        return (n % 2 == 0) ? n : (n * 2);
    }
}

Translate the above java code to python.

python code:

[/INST]
```python
import sys

def problem102a(n):
    return n * 2 if n % 2 == 0 else n

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    print(problem102a(n))
```
This is the equivalent Python code for the given Java code. The `BufferedReader` and `InputStreamReader` classes are not needed in Python, as the `sys.stdin` object provides a similar functionality. The `readLine()` method is replaced with the `readline()` method, which reads a single line from the input stream. The `parseInt()` method is not needed in Python, as the `int()` function can be used to convert a string to an integer. The `problem102a()` function is defined in the same way as in the Java code, with the only difference being that the `return` statement is written in a more concise way using the ternary operator. Finally, the `main()` function is defined in the same way as in the Java code, with the only difference being that the `print()` function is used to print the result to the console.</s>
