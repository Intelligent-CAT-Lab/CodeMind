python code:

import re
print(re.sub(r"(apple|peach)", lambda m: ["apple","peach"][m.group(0)=="apple"], input()))


Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

[/INST]

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:
```
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "apple peach";
        String pattern = "(apple|peach)";
        Pattern r = Pattern.compile(pattern);
        Matcher m = r.matcher(input);
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
        while (m.find()) {
            String replacement = m.group(0).equals("apple") ? "apple" : "peach";
            m.appendReplacement(sb, replacement);
        }
        m.appendTail(sb);
        System.out.println(sb.toString());
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes from the `java.util.regex` package to perform the regular expression matching and replacement. The `Pattern` class is used to compile the regular expression pattern, and the `Matcher` class is used to perform the matching and replacement.

The `StringBuffer` class is used to store the result of the replacement. The `appendReplacement` method is used to append the replacement string to the `StringBuffer`, and the `appendTail` method is used to append the remaining part of the input string to the `StringBuffer`.

The `System.out.println` statement is used to print the result of the replacement.

Note that the `lambda` function in the Python code is not directly equivalent to a Java lambda expression. In Java, the equivalent of a Python lambda function would be a method reference, which can be used to refer to a method that takes no arguments and returns a value. For example:
```
String replacement = m.group(0).equals("apple") ? "apple" : "peach";
```
This code uses a ternary operator to check if the match is "apple" or "peach", and returns the corresponding replacement string.

In Java, you can also use a method reference to refer to a method that takes no arguments and returns a value, like this:
```
String replacement = m.group(0).equals("apple") ? "apple" : "peach";
```
This code uses a ternary operator to check if the match is "apple" or "peach", and returns the corresponding replacement string.

Note that the `input()` function in the Python code is not directly equivalent to a Java method. In Java, you can use the `Scanner` class to read input from the console, like this:
```
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
String input = scanner.nextLine();
```
This code creates a `Scanner` object that reads input from the console, and then uses the `nextLine()` method to read a line of input from the console. The `input` variable is then assigned the value of the line of input that was read.</s>
