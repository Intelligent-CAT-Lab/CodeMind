python code:

x=input()
a=0
for i in x:
  if i=='x':
    a+=1
print(["NO","YES"][a<=7])

Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        int a = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
            if (input.charAt(i) == 'x') {
                a++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(a <= 7 ? "NO" : "YES");
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `String` class to manipulate the input string. The `for` loop iterates over the characters in the input string, and the `if` statement checks if each character is equal to `'x'`. If it is, the `a` variable is incremented. Finally, the `System.out.println` method is used to print the result, which is either "NO" or "YES" depending on whether the number of `'x'` characters in the input is less than or equal to 7.</s>
