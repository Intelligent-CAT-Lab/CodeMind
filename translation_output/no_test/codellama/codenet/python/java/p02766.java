python code:

n,k = map(int, input().split())
i = 0

while n//k**i != 0:
    i += 1

print(i)


Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code equivalent to the Python code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int k = scanner.nextInt();
        int i = 0;

        while (n / k**i != 0) {
            i++;
        }

        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `Math.pow()` method to calculate the power of `k`. The `while` loop continues until the result of the division is 0, at which point the loop exits and the value of `i` is printed.</s>
