X,Y,Z = map(int, input().split())

A=X

Translate the above python code to java.

Here is the Java code equivalent to the Python code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int X = scanner.nextInt();
        int Y = scanner.nextInt();
        int Z = scanner.nextInt();

        int A = X;
        int B = Y;
        int C = Z;

        B = X;
        C = Y;
        A = Z;

        System.out.println(A + " " + B + " " + C);
    }
}
```
Note that the `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user, and the `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer value from the input. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the output.</s>
