python code:

A, B, C = map(int, input().split())

get = A - B

i = C - get

if i < 0:
    i = 0
     
print(i)


Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code equivalent to the Python code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        int C = scanner.nextInt();

        int get = A - B;
        int i = C - get;

        if (i < 0) {
            i = 0;
        }

        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
```
Note that the `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user, and the `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer value from the user. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the result to the console.</s>
