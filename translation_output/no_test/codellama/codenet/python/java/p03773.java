python code:

a,b = map(int,input().split())

print((a + b) % 24)


Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

[/INST]

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Addition {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println((a + b) % 24);
    }
}

In this code, we first import the Scanner class from the java.util package. This class is used to read input from the user.

We then create a new Scanner object called sc, which is used to read input from the user.

Next, we use the sc.nextInt() method to read two integers from the user, which are stored in the variables a and b.

Finally, we use the System.out.println() method to print the sum of a and b, modulo 24. This is the same as the Python code.

Note that in Java, we use the % operator to perform modulo operations, rather than the % symbol used in Python.</s>
