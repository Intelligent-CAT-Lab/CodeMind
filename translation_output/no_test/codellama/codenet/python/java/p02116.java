python code:

n = int(input())
print((n+1) &- (n+1))

Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

The Python code is using the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to perform a bitwise AND operation on the input `n` and the result of the expression `(n+1) &- (n+1)`. The `&-` operator is a bitwise AND operator that is used to perform a bitwise AND operation on two integers and then subtract the result from the first integer.

In Java, we can use the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to perform a bitwise AND operation on two integers, but we cannot use the `&-` operator. Instead, we can use the bitwise NOT operator (`~`) to perform a bitwise NOT operation on the result of the expression `(n+1) &- (n+1)`, which will give us the same result as the Python code.

Here is the Java code that performs the same operation as the Python code:
```
int n = Integer.parseInt(input);
int result = n & ~(n+1);
System.out.println(result);
```
In this code, we first parse the input `n` as an integer using the `Integer.parseInt()` method. We then perform a bitwise AND operation on `n` and the result of the expression `(n+1) &- (n+1)` using the bitwise AND operator (`&`). Finally, we print the result to the console using the `System.out.println()` method.

Note that the Java code uses the `Integer.parseInt()` method to parse the input `n` as an integer, which is different from the Python code that uses the `int()` function to parse the input `n` as an integer.</s>
