Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.*;

class p03416 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) {
      int[] array = new int[5];
      array[0] = i % 10;
      array[1] = i / 10 % 10;
      array[2] = i / 100 % 10;
      array[3] = i / 1000 % 10;
      array[4] = i / 10000 % 10;
      if (array[0] == array[4] && array[1] == array[3]) {
        count++;
      }
    }
    System.out.println(count);
  }
}
```

### Response:
```python
import java.util.*;

class p03416:
  def main(self):
    sc = Scanner(System.in)
    a = sc.nextInt()
    b = sc.nextInt()
    count = 0
    for i in range(a, b+1):
      array = [i % 10, i // 10 % 10, i // 100 % 10, i // 1000 % 10, i // 10000 % 10]
      if array[0] == array[4] and array[1] == array[3]:
        count += 1
    print(count)
```

Explanation:

- We first import the `java.util` package to use the `Scanner` class.
- We define a class `p03416` with a method `main` that takes no arguments.
- We create a `Scanner` object `sc` to read input from the standard input stream.
- We read two integers `a` and `b` from the input stream using the `nextInt` method of the `Scanner` class.
- We initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of pairs of numbers that satisfy the condition.
- We use a `for` loop to iterate over all the integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive).
- For each integer `i`, we create an array `array` of length 5 to store the digits of `i`.
- We use integer division (`//`) to extract the last digit of `i` and store it in the first element of the array.
- We use integer division again to extract the second last digit of `i` and store it in the second element of the array.
- We use integer division again to extract the third last digit of `i` and store it in the third element of the array.
- We use integer division again to extract the fourth last digit of `i` and store it in the fourth element of the array.
- We use the modulo operator (`%`) to extract the last digit of `i` and store it in the fifth element of the array.
- We check if the first and fourth elements of the array are equal and the second and third elements are equal. If they are, we increment the `count` variable.
- Finally, we print the value of `count` to the standard output stream using the `println` method of the `System.out` object.<|endoftext|>
