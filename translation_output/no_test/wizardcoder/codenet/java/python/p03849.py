Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class p03849 {
	public static long MOD = 1000000007;
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long n = sc.nextLong();
		System.out.println(f(n+1));
	}
	static HashMap<Long, Long> mb = new HashMap<>();
	public static long f(long n) {
		Long memo = mb.get(n);
		if (memo!= null) return memo;
		if (n <= 2) {
			return n;
		}
		long res = f(n/2) + f((n-1)/2) + f((n+1)/2);
		res %= MOD;
		mb.put(n, res);
		return res;
	}
}


```

### Response:
```python
import java.util.HashMap

MOD = 1000000007

def f(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    if n in mb:
        return mb[n]
    res = f(n//2) + f((n-1)//2) + f((n+1)//2)
    res %= MOD
    mb[n] = res
    return res

n = int(input())
mb = {}
print(f(n+1))
```

Explanation:

- We import the `java.util.HashMap` class to use a hashmap to store the values of `f(n)` for previously calculated values of `n`.
- We define a global variable `MOD` to store the value of `1000000007`.
- We define a function `f(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of ways to arrange `n` balls in a row such that the first and last balls are different.
- Inside the function, we first check if the value of `n` is already present in the hashmap `mb`. If it is, we return the value stored in the hashmap.
- If the value of `n` is not present in the hashmap, we check if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If it is, we return `n` as there is only one way to arrange `n` balls in a row if the first and last balls are different.
- If `n` is greater than 2, we recursively calculate the number of ways to arrange `n/2` balls in a row and `n-1/2` balls in a row and `n+1/2` balls in a row. We add these three values and take the modulo of `MOD` to get the final result.
- We store the result in the hashmap `mb` for future use.
- We take input `n` from the user and call the `f(n+1)` function to get the number of ways to arrange `n+1` balls in a row such that the first and last balls are different. We print the result.<|endoftext|>
