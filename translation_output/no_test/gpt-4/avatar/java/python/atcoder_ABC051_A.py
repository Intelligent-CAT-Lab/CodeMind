Below is the translated Python code from the provided Java code:

```python
def atcoder_ABC051_A():
    abc_input = input().split(',')
    a, b, c = abc_input
    print(a, b, c)

# Uncomment the following line to run the function when you run the script
# atcoder_ABC051_A()
```

You can call the function `atcoder_ABC051_A()` to execute the code. In Python, there's no need for a class to define this simple function. Additionally, Python's `input` function reads a line from input, splitting by commas using the `split` method from strings, and it's not necessary to specify the delimiter as in Java Scanner's `useDelimiter` method.
