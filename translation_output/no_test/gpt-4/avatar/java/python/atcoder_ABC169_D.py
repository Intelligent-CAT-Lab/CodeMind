Below is the translated Python code from the provided Java code:

```python
from math import isqrt

def main():
    N = int(input())
    factors = prime_factor(N)
    count = 0
    for pow in factors:
        increase = 1
        while pow - increase >= 0:
            pow -= increase
            increase += 1
            count += 1
    print(count)

def prime_factor(N):
    res = []
    for i in range(2, isqrt(N) + 1):
        count = 0
        while N % i == 0:
            N //= i
            count += 1
        if count != 0:
            res.append(count)
    if N != 1:
        res.append(1)
    return res

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note the differences:

- `isqrt(N) + 1` is the equivalent of Java's `Math.sqrt(N)` but gives an integer result in Python.
- The way to read an input in Python is `input()`, which reads a line as a string, so it needs to be converted to `int`.
- Lists in Python do not have the method `get()`, you can access the list by index directly using `list[index]`.
- The Python equivalent of Java's `System.out.println` is simply `print` in Python.
- Static methods in classes are simply standalone functions in Python, with no need to be within a class structure.
- The `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard is used to execute the `main()` function only when the script is run directly, not when imported as a module.
