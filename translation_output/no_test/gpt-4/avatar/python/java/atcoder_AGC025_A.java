Below is the translated Java code from the provided Python code. The Python code reads an integer `N` from the standard input, computes and prints the minimum sum of digits for the pair of numbers `a` and `b` such that `a + b = N`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    private static final int INF = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    private static final int mod = 1000000007; // 10**9 + 7

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();

        int ans = INF;
        for (int a = 1; a < N; a++) {
            int b = N - a;
            ans = Math.min(ans, dsum(a) + dsum(b));
        }
        System.out.println(ans);

        sc.close();
    }

    private static int dsum(int x) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (x > 0) {
            sum += x % 10; // Add last digit to sum
            x /= 10;       // Remove the last digit
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Please note the following details regarding the Java translation:
- I defined the `INF` constant as `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which signifies the practical "infinity" value for integers in Java.
- Recursive calls are less common in Java for problems where deep recursion might occur since the Java stack is not as generous as the Python one. However, the provided Python code does not actually make any recursive calls, so there was no need to set a recursion limit in Java.
- The `mod` constant is represented as an integer literal `1000000007`.
- Java's `Scanner` class is used to read from standard input.
- A `dsum` method is created to calculate the digit sum of an integer `x`.
- The `main` method contains the logic to determine the minimum sum of digits for the specified conditions, akin to the Python code logic.
