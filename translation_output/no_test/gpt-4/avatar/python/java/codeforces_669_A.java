Below is the translated code from Python to Java for the provided snippet:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        if (n % 3 == 0) {
            System.out.println(n / 3 * 2);
        } else if (n < 3) {
            System.out.println(1);
        } else {
            System.out.println(n / 3 * 2 + 1);
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

In this snippet, we're importing `Scanner` to handle input as it's the Java alternative to Python's `input()`. Moreover, we're using integer division `/` because in Java, dividing two integers already results in an integer quotient (it does the floor division like `//` in Python). The "print" function is replaced with `System.out.println()` for output. Additionally, the variables and functions which were imported from the `math` module in Python are not being used in the provided code snippet and hence not included in the Java translation.
