The equivalent Java code would look something like this:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int w = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            if (i * (i + 1) / 2 < N && N <= (i + 1) * (i + 2) / 2) {
                w = i + 1;
                break;
            }
        }

        for (int i = w; i > 0; i--) {
            if (N >= i) {
                System.out.println(i);
                N -= i;
            }
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This Java code does the following:

1. It starts by importing the `Scanner` class for reading input from the standard input stream (typically, the console).
2. Then it defines a class named `Main` with the `main` method, which is the entry point of the Java program.
3. Inside the `main` method, the code creates an instance of `Scanner` to read the next integer value from the input, which corresponds to `N` in the Python example.
4. It then enters a loop (the Java equivalent of the Python `range` function) to find the value of `w`, which is the largest `i` such that `sum(i) < N`.
5. Following that, it enters another loop to sequentially print and subtract values from `N` from `w` down to 1, as long as `N` is greater than or equal to the loop counter `i`.
6. After the program has completed the calculations, it closes the `Scanner` to avoid any potential resource leaks.
