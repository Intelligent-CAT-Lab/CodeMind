The provided Python code uses the NumPy library for vectorized operations on arrays and dynamic programming (DP) to solve a problem, which seems to involve counting configurations based on the conditions described in the (likely Japanese) comments.

Here's how we can translate this code to Java. Since Java does not have a direct equivalent of NumPy, we'll use regular arrays and manually handle vectorized operations:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    static final long MOD = (long) 1e9 + 7;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        
        String[] parts = br.readLine().split(" ");
        int N = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
        int M = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);

        long[] dp_T = new long[N+1];
        long[] dp_F = new long[N+1];
        Arrays.fill(dp_F, 1);
        dp_T[0] = 1;
        dp_F[0] = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            long[] prev_T = dp_T.clone();
            long[] prev_F = dp_F.clone();
            dp_T = new long[N+1];
            dp_F = new long[N+1];

            // Red-Red
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                dp_T[j] = (dp_T[j] + prev_T[j+1]) % MOD;
                if (j+1 < N ) { // prevent ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
                    dp_F[j+1] = (dp_F[j+1] + prev_F[j+2]) % MOD;
                }
            }
            dp_T[0] = (dp_T[0] + prev_F[1]) % MOD;
            
            // Red-Blue
            for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++) {
                dp_T[j] = (dp_T[j] + prev_T[j]) % MOD;
                if (j+1 <= N) { // prevent ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
                    dp_F[j+1] = (dp_F[j+1] + prev_F[j+1]) % MOD;
                }
            }
            dp_T[1] = (dp_T[1] + prev_F[1]) % MOD;

            // Blue-Red
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                dp_T[j] = (dp_T[j] + prev_T[j]) % MOD;
                dp_F[j] = (dp_F[j] + prev_F[j]) % MOD;
            }

            // Blue-Blue
            for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++) {
                dp_T[j] = (dp_T[j] + prev_T[j-1]) % MOD;
                dp_F[j] = (dp_F[j] + prev_F[j-1]) % MOD;
            }
        }

        long answer = 0;
        for (long x : dp_T) {
            answer = (answer + x) % MOD;
        }

        System.out.println(answer);
    }
}
```

Please note that this conversion assumes the following:

1. The use of BufferedReader for input, which is a common practice in Java for fast input reading.
2. The direct translation of the logic as closely as possible from Python to Java.
3. The `%=` operator is handled with explicit modulo operations after every increment to mimic Python's behavior of handling negative numbers in modulo operations.
4. The comment line containing Japanese characters is removed as they were comments and not part of the logic.
5. The translated code assumes that input data fits within the limits of Java's `int` data type.

Make sure to adjust the class name and additional I/O or constraints based on the actual problem environment if required.
