Certainly! The Python code you provided reads a line from standard input and counts the occurrences of the character '1' in that line, then prints out the count. In Java, you can accomplish the same task using the `Scanner` class to read from standard input and the `String` class methods. Here's the Java equivalent code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CountOnes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        long count = input.chars().filter(ch -> ch == '1').count();
        System.out.println(count);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This code snippet first imports the `Scanner` class which is used to read data from various input streams including standard input. In the `main` method, it creates an instance of `Scanner` to read a line of text from standard input. Then it calculates the number of '1' characters by converting the `String` to a stream of characters, filtering by the character '1', and counting the remaining characters. Finally, it prints out the number of times '1' appears in the input string and closes the `Scanner` to free up resources.
