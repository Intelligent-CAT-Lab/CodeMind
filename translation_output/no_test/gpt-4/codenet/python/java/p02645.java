The Python code you provided reads input from the user, takes the first three characters of that input, and prints them out. The equivalent Java code to perform the same task would be as follows:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine(); // Read the input from the user
        System.out.println(input.substring(0, Math.min(3, input.length()))); // Print the first three characters
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
This Java code creates a `Scanner` object to read input from the standard input (usually the keyboard), then reads the entire line of input. It then uses the `substring` method to extract the first three characters of the input, being careful to not exceed the length of the input if it's less than three characters long. Finally, it prints out the resulting substring. The `scanner.close()` statement is included to close the scanner and free up system resources, though this is not strictly necessary in such a short and simple program.
