The provided Python code takes an input string, and checks if it is possible to form the string "keyence" by removing a continuous substring from it. If it’s possible, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The second loop with the `k` variable does not seem to make sense because `i` is not defined in its scope, so it looks like an error in the code. I'll assume you want to correct that and check every possible substring of length 7 (since "keyence" consists of 7 characters) starting at each position `k` in the string. With that assumption, here's how you could translate the code into Java:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class KeyenceString {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = scanner.nextLine();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = i; j <= S.length(); j++) {
                if (S.substring(0, i) + S.substring(j).equals("keyence")) {
                    System.out.println("YES");
                    return;
                }
            }
        }

        // Check every possible contiguous substring of length 7
        for (int k = 0; k <= S.length() - 7; k++) {
            if (S.substring(k, k + 7).equals("keyence")) {
                System.out.println("YES");
                return;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("NO");
    }
}
```

Here's what changes I've made:

- In Java, you need to import the `Scanner` class to get user input.
- The `input()` function from Python is replaced with `scanner.nextLine()` to read an entire line of input.
- Java uses `String.substring(beginIndex, endIndex)` to get a part of the string, unlike Python's slicing syntax.
- We replace the `exit()` calls with `return` to immediately exit the `main` method.
- Java doesn't have the colon operator for slicing as in Python (`S[i::i+8]`), so we instead use a loop that checks every substring of length 7 starting from each index `k`.
- Java’s `println` method is used instead of `print`.
- Java string concatenation is done using the `+` operator directly, and string comparison is done with the `equals` method instead of `==`.
- The nested for-loops are adjusted to match Java's 0-based indexing and the exclusive upper bound in `substring`.

Remember to import the Scanner class, as Java requires explicit imports for classes outside of `java.lang` package.
