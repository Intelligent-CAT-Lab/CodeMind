Here's the translated Java code into Python. I've translated the functionality of the `FastScanner` class in Java into using Python's standard input functionalities with `sys.stdin` for reading inputs. Since Python does not have a default fast I/O functionality equivalent to the Java `FastScanner`, we can use `stdin` and `splitlines()` to handle input more efficiently if needed.

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    # read integers n and k from input
    n, k = map(int, input().split())

    # output result based on comparison
    if n <= k:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)

# Using threading to increase the stack size if needed
if __name__ == "__main__":
    threading.stack_size(16 * 1024 * 1024)  # 16MB stack
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
    thread.join()
```

Note that in Python, there is no explicit need for a custom fast input reader class like `FastScanner` for the given problem because Python's built-in `input()` function (or `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` for slightly faster input) usually suffices for competitive programming unless the input is extremely large.

If you are using Python and encounter a scenario where standard input reading is too slow, some programmers switch to using `.read().splitlines()` to read all input at once and split it, or use PyPy, an alternative Python interpreter that often runs faster than the standard CPython interpreter. The threading component is used to start the main function in a new thread, which allows an increased stack size, mimicking the Java code's approach of starting a new thread with more stack memory.
