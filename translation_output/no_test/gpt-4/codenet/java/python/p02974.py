Here is the translated Python code:

```python
import sys

# Helper input functions
def ni():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())

def ns():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()

# Solve function
def solve():
    n, K = ni(), ni()
    if K % 2 == 1:
        print(0)
        return
    mod = 1000000007
    dp = [[0] * (2 * n * n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][n * n] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ndp = [[0] * (2 * n * n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n + 1):
            for k in range(2 * n * n + 1):
                if dp[j][k] == 0:
                    continue
                # add source
                if j + 1 <= n and k - i >= 0:
                    ndp[j + 1][k - i] += dp[j][k]
                    ndp[j + 1][k - i] %= mod
                # add sink or local sink
                if j - 1 >= 0 and k + i <= 2 * n * n:
                    ndp[j - 1][k + i] += dp[j][k] * j * j
                    ndp[j - 1][k + i] %= mod
                # add intermediate point
                ndp[j][k] += dp[j][k] * 2 * j
                ndp[j][k] %= mod

                # add isolated point
                ndp[j][k] += dp[j][k]
                ndp[j][k] %= mod
        dp = ndp
    print(dp[0][K // 2 + n * n])

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

Please note that this translation doesn't include all the methods from the original code, which were related to input handling in Java. Since Python's standard input handling is different and much simpler, they are not necessary. The translation provided here assumes the input will be provided in the same format as expected in the Java code but uses Python's built-in functions to read from standard input. This code should be run with Python 3.
