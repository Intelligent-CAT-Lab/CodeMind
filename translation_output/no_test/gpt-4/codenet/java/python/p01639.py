Here's the Java code translated to Python:

```python
import math

class p01639:
    def __init__(self):
        self.n = int(input())
        self.k = int(input()) - 1
        self.x0 = int(input())
        
    def run(self):
        self.solve()
        
    def solve(self):
        if self.x0 == 0:
            print("0")
            return
        
        x = self.x0
        s = int(1e4)
        count = [0] * s
        offset = math.pow(2, 63)
        M = s / math.pow(2, 64)
        
        for i in range(self.n):
            at = int((x + offset) * M)
            at = max(0, min(at, s - 1))
            count[at] += 1
            x ^= x << 13
            x ^= (x & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) >> 7
            x ^= x << 17
            
        sum = 0
        length = -1
        target = -1
        for i in range(s):
            if sum <= self.k and self.k < sum + count[i]:
                target = i
                length = count[i]
                break
            sum += count[i]
            
        now = 0
        is_list = [0] * length
        x = self.x0
        for i in range(self.n):
            at = int((x + offset) * M)
            at = max(0, min(at, s - 1))
            if at == target:
                is_list[now] = x
                now += 1
            x ^= x << 13
            x ^= (x & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) >> 7
            x ^= x << 17
        
        is_list.sort()
        print(f"{is_list[self.k - sum]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    obj = p01639()
    obj.run()
```

Note the following differences in the translation:
- In the original Java code, `Scanner` is used for input, but in Python `input()` function is used.
- In Python, logical right shift (`>>>`) doesn't exist because Python integers have no fixed size. Python uses `>>` for arithmetic right shift. In the code translation `(x & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) >> 7` masks `x` to emulate 64-bit unsigned right shift behavior.
- The `sort()` method is used on lists in Python instead of `Arrays.sort()` from Java.
- Python does not have an equivalent of Java's `println`, so `print()` is used instead with formatted strings (f-strings).
- Class and method definitions, along with the execution flow, have been slightly adjusted to adhere to Python syntax and programming conventions.

Please note that translating Java bitwise operations to Python can be tricky because Python's integers aren't limited to a fixed number of bits (like Java's long 64-bit limit). The mask operation `(x & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)` is used to ensure that the arithmetic right shift behaves similarly to Java's logical right shift on 64-bit integers. If you're working with different numerical bounds, you may need to adjust the masking accordingly.
