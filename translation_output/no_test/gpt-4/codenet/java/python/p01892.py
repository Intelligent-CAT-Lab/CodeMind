Below is the equivalent Python code using the built-in input function to read inputs from the user.

```python
import sys

class p01892:
    def solve(self):
        self.A = int(input())
        self.B = int(input())
        self.N = int(input())

        ans = abs(self.A - self.B)
        for i in range(1, self.N + 1):
            for j in range(1, self.N + 1):
                if i * self.B % j != 0:
                    continue
                ans = min(ans, abs(self.A - i * self.B // j))

        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    problem = p01892()
    problem.solve()
```

Please note that in Python 3, the default `input()` function reads a string from the standard input. If you need to read integer values, you should cast them from the string to `int` using `int(input())`. The Python code example above assumes that A, B, and N will be given as separate inputs line by line.

There's no need for explicit buffer handling or error checking when using the built-in input functions unless you are processing huge amounts of data or need non-blocking I/O, in which case you might want to use `sys.stdin.readline()` or other more advanced I/O mechanisms available in the `io` or `asyncio` modules of Python.

The Java code is a bit more complex because it implements custom input parsing to potentially handle faster I/O for competitive programming. This is not usually necessary in Python scripts unless dealing with extreme performance requirements, so I have left it out for simplicity and clarity.
