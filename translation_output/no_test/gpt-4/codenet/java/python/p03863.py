Here is the equivalent Python code using the built-in functionality for reading input and output:

```python
import sys
import time

def solve():
    s = input()
    l = len(s)

    if (l % 2 == 0) ^ (s[0] == s[l - 1]):
        print("Second")
    else:
        print("First")

def main():
    S = time.time()
    solve()
    sys.stdout.flush()
    G = time.time()
    if INPUT:
        print(f"{int((G-S)*1000)}ms")

# For this snippet to work, INPUT should be defined as a string.
# In an actual script, it would be more common to read from sys.stdin directly.
INPUT = ""
if INPUT:
    sys.stdin = io.StringIO(INPUT)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

I assumed that `INPUT` is a means to provide input for testing purposes; that's why I've added optional `INPUT` handling. In Python, it's more typical to read directly from `sys.stdin`, and if you'd need to handle input strings for testing purposes, you could replace `sys.stdin` with a `StringIO` as shown above.

Please note that Python uses indentation to define the structure of the code instead of curly braces `{}`. Also, the bitwise exclusive OR is done with `^` in Python, just like in Java.

In the original Java code, there are several methods to read different types of data from input, but in Python, you can directly use `input()` to read strings and then cast them to other types if necessary. The error handling for input/output operations is also different in Python and can be customized depending on the requirements.

Lastly, `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to ensure that all output has been written, which is analogous to `out.flush()` in the Java code. The `time.time()` function in Python returns the current time in seconds since the epoch, and to measure milliseconds, you would multiply the difference by 1000, just like in the Java code with `System.currentTimeMillis()`.
