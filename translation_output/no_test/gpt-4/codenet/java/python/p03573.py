Here is the translated Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
# Read input from the user
A = int(input())
B = int(input())
C = int(input())

# Determine the output based on the condition
if A == B:
    print(C)
elif B == C:
    print(A)
else:
    print(B)
```

This code will produce the same logical outcome as the provided Java code, reading three integers from the user and then printing one of them based on the specified conditions.
