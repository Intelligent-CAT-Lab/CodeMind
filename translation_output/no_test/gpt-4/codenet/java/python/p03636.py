Certainly! The code you've provided in Java is responsible for reading a string from user input, then printing the first character of the string, followed by the length of the string excluding the first and last character, and finally printing the last character of the string. Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
# No import needed for standard input in Python

def main():
    s = input()
    leng = len(s)
    print(f"{s[0]}{leng-2}{s[-1]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this Python version, we don't need to import any specific libraries to read from the standard input. We use Python's built-in `input()` function instead of Java's `Scanner`. Additionally, I wrapped the code in a `main()` function to mirror the Java code's structure and used a `print()` statement with an f-string for formatting the output.
