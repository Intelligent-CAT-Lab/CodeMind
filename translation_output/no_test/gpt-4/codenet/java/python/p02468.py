Here is the translated Python code from the given Java code:

```python
import sys

class TaskX:
    def solve(self, test_number, m, n):
        modP = 1000000007
        return self.power(m, n, modP)

    @staticmethod
    def power(a, e, modP):
        ret = 1
        while e > 0:
            if e % 2 != 0:
                ret = (ret * a) % modP
            a = (a * a) % modP
            e //= 2
        return ret


def split_tokens(input_string):
    return input_string.split()


def next_int(tokenizer):
    return int(next(tokenizer))

    
def main():
    tokenizer = split_tokens(sys.stdin.read())
    m = next_int(tokenizer)
    n = next_int(tokenizer)
    solver = TaskX()
    result = solver.solve(1, m, n)
    print(result)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Some notes and assumptions about the translation:
- I've replaced the `InputReader` with simpler functions that use Python's built-in capabilities to read from the standard input (`sys.stdin.read()`), and a tokenizer made with the `split()` function for simplicity.
- I have also omitted the class `InputReader` since it's not idiomatic in Python to create a separate class for input handling when you can do it simply in functions or inline.
- The `solve` method receives test number, `m` and `n` directly in Python translation; they are parsed before calling.
- The Python translation expects the entire input to be available at once. In this implementation, it's not designed for streaming input, to keep compatibility with how the `InputReader` class was supposed to work.
- In Java, the main method contains logic for reading from input. This has been moved outside in Python to be more idiomatic with Python's style of handling file input/output streams.
- Python does not need to close the standard output explicitly. Hence, `sys.stdout` is automatically closed at the end of the program.
- I've assumed that the input will contain `m` and `n` separated by new lines or spaces and nothing more since the Java code does not account for multiple test cases or additional input processing.
