Here is the code translated to Python and included within the requested markdown code block:

```python
# 入力
n = int(input())

# 主処理
result = 0
for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
    result += i

# 出力
print(result)
```

I've attempted to maintain the variable names and comments in their original encoding to preserve their intended meaning. However, I'll provide a translated version with the comments in English for clarity:

```python
# Input
n = int(input())

# Main processing
result = 0
for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
    result += i

# Output
print(result)
```

Both code snippets are functional equivalents of the provided Java code, which computes the sum of all integers from `n-1` down to `1`.
