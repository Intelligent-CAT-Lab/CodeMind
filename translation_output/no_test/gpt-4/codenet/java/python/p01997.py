Below is the translated Python code from the provided Java code:

```python
import math
import sys

def solve(a, b):
    print(4.0/3.0 * math.pi * b**3)
 
def main():
    inputs = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
    a = float(inputs[0])
    b = float(inputs[1])
    solve(a, b)

class Methods:
    
    @staticmethod
    def print(*ar):
        print(ar)
    
    @staticmethod
    def max(*ar):
        return max(ar)
    
    @staticmethod
    def min(*ar):
        return min(ar)
    
    @staticmethod
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a
    
    @staticmethod
    def lcm(a, b):
        return a // Methods.gcd(a, b) * b
    
    @staticmethod
    def factorial(i):
        if i == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return i * Methods.factorial(i - 1)
    
    @staticmethod
    def manhat(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        return abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)
    
    @staticmethod
    def euclid(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
    
    @staticmethod
    def is_prime(n):
        if n == 2:
            return True
        if n < 2 or n % 2 == 0:
            return False
        for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

# Run the main function when the script is executed
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

A few notes about the translation:

1. The `Methods` class in Java has been translated to a `Methods` class in Python with `staticmethods`. This is because Python does not require an instance of a class to call a static method.

2. The custom `FastScanner` class in Java used for input parsing is not needed in Python as there are simpler ways to read input. Here, I used `sys.stdin.readline()` and assumed that input is given in the correct format. If exact behavior is needed, more sophisticated input parsing can be added.

3. `print()` is used in Python to output to stdout rather than `PrintWriter`.

4. `Math.toIntExact()` is not needed in Python as integer casting (`int()`) will raise errors if conversion isn't possible, ensuring exactness.

5. Special attention is needed when replicating the exact error-handling behavior of Java in Python, as Python's error handling is different. The translated version assumes that the input format is as expected without any validation or exception handling.

6. The `main()` function is defined to encapsulate the execution flow. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard ensures that `main()` is called only when this script is run directly, not when imported as a module.
