Here's the translated Python code:

```python
def dfs(pos, pace, n, high, low):
    if pos > n:
        return 0
    
    # 3.0X
    if pace < high:
        npace = 3 * pace
        npos = pos + npace
        if (npos == n) and (npace == 1 or npace == 3):
            return 1
        else:
            temp = dfs(npos, npace, n, high, low)
            if temp != 0:
                return 1 + temp
    
    # 1.0X
    npace = pace
    npos = npace + pos
    if (npos == n) and (npace == 1 or npace == 3):
        return 1
    else:
        temp = dfs(npos, npace, n, high, low)
        if temp != 0:
            return 1 + temp
    
    # 0.3X
    if pace > low:
        npace = pace // 3
        npos = pos + npace
        if (npos == n) and (npace == 3 or npace == 1):
            return 1
        else:
            temp = dfs(npos, npace, n, high, low)
            if temp != 0:
                return 1 + temp
    
    return 0


def main():
    low, high = 1, 3**32
    n = int(input())
    ans = -1 if n == 0 else dfs(1, 1, n, high, low)
    print(ans + 1)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: 
- Python does not use long type explicitly, as its int type automatically handles long integers.
- I restructured the dfs function to take the high and low bounds, and the value of n as parameters to avoid the use of global variables.
- In Java, the bitwise OR `|` could be used since Java uses primitive types. However, in Python, it is common to use the logical OR `or` with Boolean conditions. 
- The Python `input()` function is used to receive user input and `int()` is called to convert it to an integer.
- Python does not require a class to run the main function; you can use `if __name__ == "__main__":` to check if the script is being run as the main program.
