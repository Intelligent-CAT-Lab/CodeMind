Here's the translated code in Python:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    x, y = int(input()), int(input())
    print("YES" if (x + 1) // 2 >= y else "NO")
```

This Python code takes two inputs just like the Java version and then prints "YES" if the condition is met or "NO" otherwise. In the Python code, the `//` operator is used for integer division, whereas in the Java code, the `/` operator performs integer division because both operands are integers.
