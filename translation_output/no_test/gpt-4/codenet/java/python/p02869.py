Here is the Java code translated to Python enclosed in triple backticks as requested:

This Python code attempts to replicate the functionality of your provided Java code. Note that Python uses zero-based indexing, doesn't have built-in input scanning functions like Java's `Scanner`, and uses lists and other native data structures rather than arrays to represent similar concepts. Also, Python doesn't have a direct equivalent to Java's `PrintWriter` and `BufferedReader`, so I've implemented an equivalent to print to standard output and called Python's built-in `input()` function to read from standard input. The exception handling in the input functions has been removed because Python's built-in functions already raise exceptions on errors. The sorting function also differs slightly, with Python using a lambda to replicate Java's comparator behavior.
