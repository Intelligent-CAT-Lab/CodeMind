Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
s = input("Enter a character: ")
c = s[0]

# Since the behavior is to just increment the character by 1
# within the range 'a' to 'y', it can be done using chr and ord functions.

if 'a' <= c <= 'y':
    out = chr(ord(c) + 1)
    print(out)
else:
    print("Character not in range 'a' to 'y'")
```

In Python, we don't need to import any special classes to get user input; we can simply use the `input()` function. We also don't use a `switch` statement because Python does not have switch-case construct like Java. Instead, we use an if-else statement. For this particular case, since the action for each case is very uniform (incrementing the letter by one), we simplify the code by using the `ord()` function to get the Unicode code point of the character, then add one to it and then use the `chr()` function to get the character corresponding to the resulting Unicode code point. The check `'a' <= c <= 'y'` ensures that we only increment the character if it's in the allowed range.
