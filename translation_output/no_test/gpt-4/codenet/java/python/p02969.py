Here is the equivalent Python code for the Java code snippet you provided:

```python
def p02969():
    a = int(input())
    print(a * a * 3)

p02969()
```

This Python function does the same thing as the Java code: it reads an integer from the standard input and prints the result of the integer squared times 3.
