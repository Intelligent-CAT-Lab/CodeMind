Here is the Python equivalent of the provided Java code:

```python
def main(s):
    length = len(s)

    cnt = 0
    l = 0
    r = length - 1
    while l <= r:
        cl = s[l]
        cr = s[r]

        if cl == cr:
            l += 1
            r -= 1
        else:
            if cl == 'x':
                cnt += 1
                l += 1
            elif cr == 'x':
                cnt += 1
                r -= 1
            else:
                cnt = -1
                break

    print(cnt)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input()
    main(s)
```

Please note that Python doesn't use explicit data types in variable declarations. Also, while Java uses `charAt` to access characters in a string, Python allows direct indexing with string objects. Additionally, Python functions don't need to be placed inside classes. The `print` statement is used to output the result in Python instead of `System.out.println`. Furthermore, user inputs are acquired using the `input` function in Python.
