Below is the supplied Java code translated into Python, using Python's file handling and concurrency features:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    thread = threading.Thread(target=taskadapter)
    thread.start()
    thread.join()

def taskadapter():
    # In Python, sys.stdin and sys.stdout already provide file-like objects for IO
    inp = FastInput()
    out = FastOutput()
    solver = TaskA()
    solver.solve(1, inp, out)
    out.close()

class TaskA:
    def solve(self, testNumber, inp, out):
        s = inp.read_string()
        # Python's str.find() returns -1 if not found, which is similar to indexOf in Java.
        c_index = s.find('C')
        f_index = s.rfind('F')  # Equivalent of lastIndexOf in Java
        if c_index == -1 or f_index == -1 or f_index < c_index:
            out.println("No")
        else:
            out.println("Yes")

class FastInput:
    def __init__(self):
        self._fileobj = sys.stdin.buffer  # Binary I/O

    def read(self):
        # In Python, sys.stdin.read() is used to read from stdin
        return self._fileobj.read(1)

    def skip_blank(self):
        ch = self.read()
        while ch and ch in b' \t\r\n':
            ch = self.read()
        return ch

    def read_string(self):
        # Use the skip_blank method to ignore initial whitespace
        ch = self.skip_blank()
        builder = []
        while ch and ch not in b' \t\r\n':
            builder.append(ch.decode('utf-8'))
            ch = self.read()
        return ''.join(builder)

class FastOutput:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = []

    def println(self, text):
        self.cache.append(text + '\n')
        return self

    def flush(self):
        sys.stdout.write(''.join(self.cache))
        self.cache.clear()
        sys.stdout.flush()

    def close(self):
        self.flush()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In the above Python code:
- `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` are used for input and output streams, so there's no need to create `FastInput` and `FastOutput` with these streams as parameters.
- `sys.stdin.buffer` is used to read bytes from stdin in `FastInput`. Python's inherent file object for stdin is already buffered, so there's no need to maintain a separate buffer as in the Java code.
- All the I/O in the `FastOutput` class writes to `sys.stdout`.
- Instead of multi-threading, Python's GIL may affect performance here so threads might not run concurrently (I/O might not be parallelized). The multi-threading code is still present here for one-to-one mapping with the Java code provided.
- I used list appending for string building in both `FastInput` and `FastOutput` since it's more efficient in Python than repeatedly concatenating strings.
- Error handling is omitted, as the Java code relies on unchecked exceptions whereas Python's philosophy encourages explicit exception handling.
- There's no translation for the `AutoCloseable` or `Closeable` interfaces from Java, as Python's context managers (`with` blocks) serve a similar purpose, but in this code snippet, no context manager is used.

Make sure to run this Python code as a script (not as a module import), given the thread joining in the `main` function and the usage of `if __name__ == "__main__":`.
