Here's the equivalent Python code for the given Java code:

```python
p = int(input())
print((p // 500) * 500)
```

This Python code reads an integer from standard input and then prints out the result of integer division by 500, multiplied back by 500. This essentially rounds down the input number to the nearest multiple of 500, just like the original Java code.
