The Java code above can be translated to Python with the following steps:

1. Replace the `Reader` class with Python's built-in `input()` function for reading inputs.
2. Use `print()` for outputting results instead of a `PrintWriter`.
3. Replace `ArrayList` with Python's built-in `list` type.
4. The `P` class (used for custom sorting) can be replaced with a simple tuple in Python.
5. The sorting can be done using Python's `sorted()` function with a custom key based on the second tuple element.
6. The modulo operation and other mathematical operations are straightforward in Python.

Here is the translated Python code:

```python
import sys
from functools import cmp_to_key

mod = 1000000007


class P:
    def __init__(self, x, d):
        self.x = x
        self.d = d

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.d < other.d


def main():
    n = int(input())
    d = [0] * 1000

    lis = []
    a, b = 9, 10
    for i in range(1, 10):
        lis.append(P(i, -11 + i))
    lis.append(P(19, -1))

    for i in range(1, 15):
        for w in range(1, 1000):
            x = w * b + a
            y = x
            e = 0
            while x > 0:
                e += x % 10
                x //= 10
            lis.append(P(y, y / e))
        b *= 10
        a *= 10
        a += 9

    lis.sort(key=cmp_to_key(lambda p1, p2: -1 if p1.d < p2.d else (1 if p1.d > p2.d else 0)))

    max_value = 0
    for w in range(len(lis)):
        if max_value < lis[w].x:
            max_value = lis[w].x
            print(max_value)
            n -= 1
            if n == 0:
                break

    sys.stdout.flush()


def db(*args):
    print(*args, file=sys.stderr)


def validpos(x, y, r, c):
    return 0 <= x < r and 0 <= y < c


def bit(x, k):
    return (x >> k) & 1


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: Python uses zero-based indexing, so make sure if the original Java code is using one-based indices the same logic is kept when translating to Python.

Additionally, Python generally does not preallocate lists as in Java; the list will dynamically grow as needed in Python. However, `d = [0] * 1000` preallocates a list of 1000 zeroes to maintain the logic of the original Java code.

Also, the Java comparable interface is functionally replaced with the custom comparison function using `cmp_to_key` which is used during sorting. The `__lt__` method in the `P` class is what tells Python how to compare two instances of `P`.
