The original Java code contains multiple classes and utility methods that assist with input scanning and output formatting to a byte stream. In Python, this is typically handled differently. Below is a Python equivalent that reflects the general functionality shown in the Java code, although the I/O handling is idiomatic to Python:

```python
import sys
import math


def execute():
    n = int(input())

    if (n & -n) == n:
        print("No")
        return

    print("Yes")

    if n == 3:
        print("1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6")
        return

    k = bsr(n)
    for i in range(1, (1 << k) - 1):
        print(f"{i} {i + 1}")

    print(f"{(1 << k) - 1} {n + 1}")
    
    for i in range(1, (1 << k) - 1):
        print(f"{n + i} {n + i + 1}")
    
    print(f"{(1 << k) + 1} {n + (1 << k)}")
    print(f"{n + (1 << k)} {n + 1}")
    print(f"{n + 1} {n + (1 << k) + 1}")
    print(f"{n + (1 << k) + 1} {(1 << k)}")
    
    for j in range(2, n + 1 - (1 << k)):
        print(f"{n + j} {n + (1 << k) + j}")
        print(f"{n + (1 << k) + j - 1} {(1 << k) + j}")

def bsr(n):
    return n.bit_length() - 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    execute()
```

Notes on differences:
1. The Java program contains custom Scanner and Output classes to handle buffered I/O, but in Python, this is generally handled without the need for such utilities. Hence, the built-in `input()` and `print()` functions are used in Python.
2. In Java, `nextInt()` and `nextLong()` methods are used to read input values. In Python, `int(input())` is used to read integers, handling both `next()` and `nextInt()` scenarios.
3. In Java, there is a custom `Out` class to handle output to an `OutputStream`. In Python, the built-in `print()` function handles output, which by default prints to standard output, but can be redirected if necessary.
4. The `bsr()` (Bit Scan Reverse) utility is replaced by using Python's `bit_length()` method to get the length of the binary representation of an integer, and then subtracting 1 to obtain the same result as `bsr()`. This gives the position of the highest set bit.
5. Other utility methods and custom operator classes are not translated as they are used for more complex input and output manipulations that are not necessary in the Python version.
6. The `main(String[] args)` entry point in Java is replaced with `if __name__ == "__main__":` in Python, which is idiomatic for defining the entry point of a Python script.

Keep in mind that Python's built-in functions for handling I/O are quite different from Java's I/O streams, so the above code is written to be Pythonic and not a literal line-for-line translation.
