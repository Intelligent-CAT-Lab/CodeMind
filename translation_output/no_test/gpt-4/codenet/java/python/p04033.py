Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java snippet:

```python
# Create a function to mimic the behaviour of the Java code
def check_sign():
    # Read two integers from input
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

    # Check if the range includes zero
    if a <= 0 <= b:
        print("Zero")
    else:  # If zero is not in the range, check if the number of negative numbers in range is odd
        print("Positive" if (min(0, b) - min(-1, a)) % 2 == 1 else "Negative")

# Call the function to execute it
check_sign()
```
The Python code uses built-in functions to read input and determine the sign of the range, similar to the Java code provided. The `map` function in Python is used to apply `int` conversion to both inputs simultaneously, and we can use a simple `print` statement to output the result.

Note that Python does not need an explicit import for reading from standard input like Java; `input()` function is enough. Also, Python does not require semicolons to end lines of code, which is another difference from Java's syntax.
