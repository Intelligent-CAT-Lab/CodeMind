Here is the translated code from Java to Python:

```python
import sys

def solve(n):
    perm = permutation_whose_number_of_increasing_sequence_is_k(n)
    print(len(perm) * 2)
    for i in range(1, len(perm) + 1):
        if i > 1:
            print(" ", end="")
        print(i, end="")
    for i in range(len(perm)):
        print(" ", end="")
        print(perm[i] + 1, end="")
    print()

def permutation_whose_number_of_increasing_sequence_is_k(k):
    cur = (1 << (k + 1).bit_length()) // 2 - 1
    perm_list = [i for i in range(bin(cur).count('1'))]
    p = bin(cur).count('1')
    for d in reversed(range(bin(cur).count('1'))):
        x = 1 << d
        if cur + x <= k:
            cur += x
            perm_list.insert(d, p)
            p += 1
    return perm_list

def main():
    start_time = time.time()
    n = int(input().strip())
    solve(n)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    print(f"{time.time() - start_time}ms", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

There are a few points to note in this translation:
- Python does not have the Java static method concept, so we define the functions outside of a class.
- Python's list comprehension is used to create lists instead of using loops as in Java.
- Python has built-in functions like `.bit_length()` and `.count('1')` for finding the length in bits of an integer and the number of '1's in the binary representation, respectively.
- Python's input and output management does not require importing `PrintWriter` or `InputStream` as in Java. We can directly use `input()` and `print()`.
- Exception handling in Python does not require explicit throws declarations.
- Python automatically promotes integer division to floating-point if necessary, unlike Java where you must cast one of the operands to `double` to get a floating-point result. 

Please note that this translation assumes that you have already read the integer `n` as input before calling `solve()`, just as `nl()` is expected to be used in Java to read a long integer. You might need to handle input parsing depending on where this code will be used or how you expect to provide input to it.
