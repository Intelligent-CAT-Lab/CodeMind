Here's the equivalent Python code:

```python
ans = [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 16, 12, 64, 24, 36, 48, 1024, 60]
i = int(input())

print(ans[i])
```

This Python code will produce the same result as the provided Java code. It takes an integer input and then prints the corresponding value from the pre-defined `ans` list based on the input index.
