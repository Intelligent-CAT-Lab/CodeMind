Here is the translated Python code from the provided Java code:

```python
# Integer input
n = int(input())
k = int(input())

print(n-k+1)
```

In Python, input is taken using the `input()` function and has to be converted to the required data type, such as `int` for integers. Additionally, printing to the console is done using the `print()` function. Unlike Java which requires importing Scanner for input and using System.out.println for output, Python has built-in functions to handle these tasks.
