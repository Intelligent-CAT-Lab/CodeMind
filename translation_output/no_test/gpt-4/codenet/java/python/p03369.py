Here is the Java code translated into Python:

```python
def gs():
    return input()

def gi():
    return int(input())

def gl():
    return int(input())

def gd():
    return float(input())

s = gs()

print((s.count("o") * 100) + 700)
```

This translated Python script provides similar functionalities found in the Java code that you've posted. In Python, the `input()` function replaces Java's Scanner method for reading different variable types from the input. The counting of letters "o" is done with `.count()` method directly on the string.

Note that the Python code does not contain the commented-out Java condition and the print statements because they are not active in the provided Java code. If you need that logic as well, please let me know, and I can add it to the Python translation.
