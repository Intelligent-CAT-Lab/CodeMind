Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code snippet:

```python
import sys
from itertools import product

MOD = N = None
table = []

class MyScanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self._current_line = []

    def next(self):
        if not self._current_line:
            self._current_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
        return self._current_line.pop(0)

    def next_int(self):
        return int(self.next())

    def next_long(self):
        return int(self.next())

def main():
    global MOD, N, table
    
    sc = MyScanner()
    N = sc.next_int()
    MOD = sc.next_int()

    table = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for rem in range(N + 1):
        table[N][rem] = rem
    for pos in range(N - 1, 0, -1):
        for rem in range(N+1):
            table[pos][rem] = table[pos + 1][rem]
            factor = min(pos, N + 1 - pos)
            if factor < rem:
                table[pos][rem] += table[pos][rem - factor]
                table[pos][rem] %= MOD
    
    print(table[1][N])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Here are the main changes and substitutions:
- The Python standard library method `sys.stdin.readline()` replaces the `BufferedReader` functionality.
- The `print()` function in Python directly prints to the console, which removes the need for a `PrintWriter`.
- Python's list comprehension and `range` functions replace the Java for-loop for array initialization.
- I removed the `out.flush()` as `print()` in Python automatically handles the buffer.
- I used `global` to declare and use `MOD`, `N`, and `table` since Python does not support static variables at a class level in the same manner as Java, and the variables are used inside the function `main`.
- Python does not require explicit type conversion for reading inputs. However, for the sake of structure, a `next_int` and `next_long` method method is provided in the `MyScanner` class to mimic the behavior of Java's `Scanner`.
- While Java indexes arrays from 1 in this program, Python indexes from 0. It is more idiomatic in Python to iterate ranges from `0` to `N-1`, but I have kept the original Java logic intact to make the translation as straightforward as possible.
