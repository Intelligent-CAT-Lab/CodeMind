Here is the provided Java code translated into Python:

```python
# Read input from standard input (stdin)
num_dog = input().split()

# Initialize the result to 0
result = 0

# Loop through all numbers and sum them up
for num in num_dog:
    result += int(num)

# Print the result to the standard output
print(result)
```

The Python version of the code does not require the import of any specific modules to read from standard input or write to standard output, as these functionalities are built-in. The code reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each piece to an integer, sums them, and prints the total result.
