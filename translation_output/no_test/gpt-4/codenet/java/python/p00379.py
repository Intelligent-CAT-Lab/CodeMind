Here is the Java code translated into Python:

```python
def main():
    a = int(input())
    n = int(input())
    m = int(input())
    max = int(m ** (1 / n))
    
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, max + 1):
        x = i ** n
        str_x = str(x)
        y = sum(int(digit) for digit in str_x)
        
        if y + a == i:
            ans += 1
    
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Feel free to run the Python script to perform the same operation as the Java code. It takes three integers as input, "a", "n", and "m", and calculates the "ans" based on the given instructions.
