Below is the translated Python code from the provided Java code:

```python
import itertools
from fractions import Fraction

def solve(N):
    for h, n in itertools.product(range(1, 3501), repeat=2):
        # In the original Java code, the condition checks if (4*h*n-N*n-N*h) is not zero
        # to avoid division by zero, and if the fractional part of (N*h*n)/(4*h*n-N*n-N*h)
        # is zero (which implies that (N*h*n) is perfectly divisible by (4*h*n-N*n-N*h)).
        # The following Python code does the same using Fraction.
        denominator = 4*h*n-N*n-N*h
        if denominator != 0:
            result = Fraction(N*h*n, denominator)
            if result.denominator == 1:
                # Printing the result as integers, which is equivalent to the Java code.
                print(h, n, result.numerator)
                return  # Exiting the function after finding the first valid solution.

# Main entry point of the program, equivalent to 'public static void main' in Java.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    N = int(input())  # Reading the input, equivalent to 'Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in); long N=sc.nextLong();'
    solve(N)
```

Please note that Python's `itertools.product(range(1, 3501), repeat=2)` is used to replace the nested loops over the range 1 to 3500 for both `h` and `n`. Additionally, we use Python's `Fraction` class from the `fractions` module to manage the division and check whether the result is an integer. Lastly, we do not have explicit class structure here as it's not required in Python for scripting purposes.
