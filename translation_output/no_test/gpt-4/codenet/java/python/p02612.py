Certainly! Below is the translated Python code:

```python
import sys

class TaskA:
    def solve(self, testNumber, in_stream, out_stream):
        n = int(in_stream.readline())
        x = n // 1000
        y = n % 1000
        if y == 0:
            out_stream.write(f"{0}\n")
        else:
            ans = 1000 * (x + 1) - n
            out_stream.write(f"{ans}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    in_stream = sys.stdin
    out_stream = sys.stdout
    solver = TaskA()
    solver.solve(1, in_stream, out_stream)
    out_stream.flush()
```

This Python code uses `sys.stdin` for input and `sys.stdout` for output, similar to how the Java version was using `System.in` and `System.out`. The Python version reads lines from the standard input, processes them, and writes the result to the standard output. Exception handling has been omitted in this translation as typically it is not idiomatic in small Python scripts to explicitly handle such exceptions (like `IOError` in reading input).
