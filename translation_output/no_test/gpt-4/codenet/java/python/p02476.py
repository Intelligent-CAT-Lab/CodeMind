```python
import sys

# To read the input from stdin buffered, we wrap sys.stdin with io.BufferedReader.
from io import BufferedReader
import sys

# We need to import the BigInteger functionality from the 'decimal' module in Python.
from decimal import Decimal

# Wrap the stdin with BufferedReader to make it more efficient.
input_stream = BufferedReader(sys.stdin)

for line in input_stream:
    # Split the line into two parts, separating by whitespace, then map the Decimal constructor to each part.
    a, b = map(Decimal, line.split())
    # Print the remainder of a divided by b. We use the % operator for remainder/modulo in Python.
    print(a % b)

# Close the input stream
input_stream.close()
```

Note that this script expects you to feed the input directly into the standard input (stdin), i.e., you might use a command-line pipe or redirection to provide the input.

Also, Python's `Decimal` class has been used to handle arbitrary precision integers, like `BigInteger` in Java. Though `Decimal` is generally used for floating point numbers, it can handle large integers as well. It is slightly different than directly translating `BigInteger`, but in Python, you would usually manage big integers directly with `int` since python's int has arbitrary precision built-in, or use `Decimal` if you are handling very large numbers frequently. If you only deal with big integers, you could simplify the code by using `int` instead of `Decimal`.
