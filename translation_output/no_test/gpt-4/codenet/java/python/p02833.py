Here is the code translated from Java to Python:

```python
from sys import stdin

INF = 1 << 30
LINF = 1 << 55
MOD = 1000000007
mh4 = [0, -1, 1, 0]
mw4 = [-1, 0, 0, 1]
mh8 = [-1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
mw8 = [-1, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0, 1]

def solve(test_number):
    n = int(input())
    if n % 2 == 1:
        print(0)
        return

    ans = 0
    base = 10
    while True:
        if base > n: break
        ans += n // base
        base *= 5
    print(ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    solve(1)
```

Explanation:

- We import the `stdin` module, as it's commonly done in Python to read input when required.
- `INF`, `LINF`, `MOD`, `mh4`, `mw4`, `mh8`, `mw8` constants are defined similar to the Java version.
- The `solve` function is translated from the `TaskX` class's `solve` method, accepting a `test_number` (though it's unused in this context, I've kept it for completeness), and using Python's `input()` instead of a custom input class like in the original Java code.
- The `if __name__ == '__main__'` construct is the equivalent of Java's `public static void main(String[] args)` method for starting the execution of the program.
- I've removed the `MyInput` class from the original code in favor of Python's built-in `input()` function for simplicity.
- In Python, we don't need to call `close()` on the standard output stream, unlike in Java.
