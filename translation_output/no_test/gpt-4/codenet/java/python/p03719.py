Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

result = "No"
if a <= c <= b:
    result = "Yes"

print(result)
```

Note that in Python, we simply use `input()` to get input from the user, and we then convert it to an integer using `int()`. The if-statement syntax is also slightly different in Python, but it's more concise and readable. Also, there's no need to import anything to get this simple functionality in Python.
