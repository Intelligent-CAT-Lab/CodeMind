Here is the equivalent Python code for the Java code snippet you provided:

```python
# no need to import anything since input() is a built-in function

def main():
    s = input()
    
    if s[2] == s[3] and s[4] == s[5]:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

# Calling the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the standard input and checks if the third and fourth characters are the same and if the fifth and sixth characters are the same. If they are, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
