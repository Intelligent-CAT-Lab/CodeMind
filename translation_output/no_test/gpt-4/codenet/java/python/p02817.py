Here's the equivalent code in Python:

```python
# Since Python does not require explicit import for basic I/O, we can omit the import statement

def main():
    string = input()
    t_string = input()
    print(t_string + string)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python program reads two strings from standard input and prints their concatenation. In Python, there's no need to manually close the standard input like in Java.
