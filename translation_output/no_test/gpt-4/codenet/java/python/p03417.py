Certainly! Below is the equivalent Python code for the Java code you've provided:

```python
def main():
    N = int(input())
    M = int(input())

    print(abs((N - 2) * (M - 2)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Do note that Python's `input()` function reads from standard input like `Scanner` does in Java, but it reads the entire line as a string. Therefore, the `int(input())` is used to read the input as an integer. The `abs` function works the same in Python as `Math.abs` does in Java. This code assumes that two inputs will be given one after the other, each followed by pressing Enter.
