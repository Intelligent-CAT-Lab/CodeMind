Here's the equivalent Python code for the Java code you've provided:

```python
def main():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print((a + b) // 2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note that in Python, division with a single slash `/` will give a floating-point result, so I've used `//` for integer division, which will give the same behavior as in Java when dividing integers.
