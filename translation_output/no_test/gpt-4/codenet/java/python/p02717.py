Here's the equivalent Python code for the provided Java code:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    print(f"{c} {a} {b}")
```

This Python script takes three integers as input and prints them in the order `c`, `a`, `b`, just like the Java code. Note that in Python, we typically use the built-in `input()` function to get user input and `print()` for output. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` line is used to ensure that the code is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module into another script.
