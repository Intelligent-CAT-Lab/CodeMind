The Java code provided defines a class `p00404` with methods to search for a pattern based on a point `(x, y)` given as input and outputs which part of the pattern it falls into. The pattern increments based on the Fibonacci sequence, branching out east, north, west, and south alternately.

Below is the equivalent Python code for the Java code provided:

```python
class p00404:
    
    def search(self, x, y):
        x_min = 0
        y_min = 0
        x_max = 0
        y_max = 0
        f1 = 1
        f2 = 0
        
        for p in range(1<<30):  # Just a very large number to ensure the loop goes on for a while
            if x_min <= x <= x_max and y_min <= y <= y_max:
                return p % 3 + 1
            
            f = f1 + f2
            if p % 4 == 0:
                x_max += f  # east
            elif p % 4 == 1:
                y_max += f  # north
            elif p % 4 == 2:
                x_min -= f  # west
            else:
                y_min -= f  # south
            
            f2 = f1
            f1 = f

    def solve(self):
        x = int(input())
        y = int(input())
        print(self.search(x, y))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p00404().solve()
```

A few important notes about the translation:

- In Python, `long` type is not needed because integers (`int`) in Python 3 can already handle arbitrary precision numbers.
- The infinite loop `for(;;)` in Java has been replaced with `for p in range(1<<30):`, which effectively does the same by iterating a large number of times, but you should ideally have a clearer condition or a break condition.
- The `Scanner` class used for input in Java has been replaced with `input()` in Python to read from stdin.
- In Python, you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly.
- The `main` function in Java is replaced by checking `__name__ == "__main__"` in Python, which checks if the script is the main program being run.
- Class method `solve()` does not have to be a `void` function in Python; Python methods don't specify return types.
- The print statements in Java are replaced with the `print()` function in Python.
- I've also adapted the Python class definition and method definitions to be more Pythonic, using `self` as the reference to the object instance.
