Here's the translated Python code from the given Java code:

```python
import sys
import io

class p01916:
    def solve(self):
        s = input()
        
        a = [0] * 26
        b = [0] * 1111
        
        for char in s:
            a[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1

        for val in a:
            b[val] += 1
        
        for i in range(999, -1, -2):
            if b[i] > 0:
                b[i] -= 1
                break

        m = 0
        
        for i in range(1, 1001, 2):
            m += b[i]
        
        if m % 2 == 0:
            print(m // 2)
        else:
            print(m // 2 + 1)
    
    def run(self):
        self.solve()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # As Python supports multithreading but does not support starting a thread with a specified stack size and also has a GIL (Global Interpreter Lock),
    # the Java thread initialization with a specific stack size is not directly translatable or necessary in Python.
    # We can simply call the run method of the class instance.
    # Increase the recursion limit and buffer size for large inputs as specified in the Java program if needed.
    sys.setrecursionlimit(int(64 * 1024 * 1024))
    io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE = 2048
    p01916().run()
```

Please note the following modifications and considerations in the translation:

1. In Python, we don't explicitly define methods to read input such as `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()`, etc., because high-level functions such as `input()` and conversions like `int()` or `float()` are commonly used instead.
2. `System.in` and `System.out` stream handling is replaced by `input()` and `print()` in Python, which read from and write to standard input and output respectively.
3. Python does not have the concept of defining an array size beforehand for basic lists. Instead, we initialize lists with a specific length using list comprehensions.
4. The `run()` method is simplified and does not involve explicit thread management or stream flushing/closing since Python handles these internally in the execution of a script.
5. The starting point of the program `if __name__ == '__main__':` is used to check if the script is being run directly (as opposed to being imported), which is where we create an instance of the class and call its `run()` method.
6. The `byte[]` buffer and associated methods in the Java implementation do not have an exact equivalent in Python, as the input handling is abstracted in Python's `input()` function.
7. Python does not need to increase the thread stack size (`64 * 1024 * 1024`), however if it's necessary to handle deep recursion, you can set a higher recursion limit using `sys.setrecursionlimit()`, and set the `io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE` to handle large inputs.
8. There's no equivalent in Python for running a thread with a specified stack size. However, if the requirement is to run the code in a separate thread, you could use the `threading` module, but for this kind of script, it's typically unnecessary.
9. Exception handling for input/output in Python is not shown since it's typically not used with basic scripts using `input()` and `print()`. You should add exception handling where necessary based on your specific needs and environment.
10. Python uses zero-based indexing, therefore the Java code `s[i]-'a'` becomes `ord(char) - ord('a')` to get the correct index.

Make sure to provide any needed input when running this Python script.
