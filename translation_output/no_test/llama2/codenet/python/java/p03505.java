<s> Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
K, A, B = map(int, input().split())
if A <= B and K > A:
    print(-1)
elif A >= K:
    print(1)
else:
    print(1 - int(- (K-A) // (A-B))*2)
```

### Input

The first line of input contains three integers $K, A, B$ ($1 \leq K \leq 10^5, 1 \leq A, B \leq 10^9$).

### Output

Print the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.

### Constraints

- $1 \leq K, A, B \leq 10^9$

### Sample Input

```
3 1000000000 1000000000
```

### Sample Output

```
1
```

### Explanation

The answer is $1$.
