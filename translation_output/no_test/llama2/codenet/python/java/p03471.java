<s> Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
n,y=map(int,input().split())
for i in range(n+1):
    for j in range(n-i+1):
        if (y-(i*10000+j*5000))/1000==(n-i-j):
            print(str(i)+' '+str(j)+' '+str(n-i-j))
            exit()
print('-1 -1 -1')
```

### Input

The first line of input contains two integers, $n$ and $y$.

### Output

Print the three integers $i$, $j$ and $k$ such that $y-(i*10000+j*5000)=(n-i-j)*1000$ and $i+j+k=n$.

### Constraints

$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$

$1 \leq y \leq 10^9$

### Hint

You can use the following formula to calculate the sum of the first $n$ integers:

$$\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

### Example

```
Input:
n = 3
y = 10000

Output:
1 1 2
