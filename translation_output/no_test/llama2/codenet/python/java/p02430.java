<s> Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
import itertools

n, k = map(int, input().split())

l = range(n)
combs = list(itertools.combinations(l, k))

sumlist = []
for comb in combs:
    sum = 0
    for c in comb:
        sum += pow(2, c)
    sumlist.append(sum)

z = zip(sumlist, combs)
z = sorted(z)

sumlist, combs = zip(*z)

for sum, comb in zip(sumlist, combs):
    c_str = (' '.join(str(c) for c in comb))
    print(str(sum) + ": " + c_str)

```

### Input

- The first line contains two integers, `n` and `k`.
- The next line contains a string, `s`, which is the input string.

### Output

- Print the output in the same order as the input.

### Constraints

- `1 <= n, k <= 100000`
- `1 <= s.length <= 100000`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

### Sample Input

```
4 2
0101
```

### Sample Output

```
1: 01
2: 010
3: 0101
4: 01010
```
