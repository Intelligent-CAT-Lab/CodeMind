<s> Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
n, a, b = map(int,input().split())

if n >= 2:
    if b >= a:
        print((n-2)*(b-a)+1)
    else:
        print(0)
else:
    if a == b:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)
```

### Input

The first line contains three integers $n, a, b$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5, 1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9$).

### Output

Print the number of ways to make $n$ consecutive pairs of integers $a$ and $b$ such that $a < b$.

### Constraints

- $1 \leq n \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9$

### Sample Input

```
3 1 2
```

### Sample Output

```
2
```

### Explanation

There are two ways to make three consecutive pairs of integers $1$ and $2$:

- $1, 2, 1$
- $1, 2, 2$
