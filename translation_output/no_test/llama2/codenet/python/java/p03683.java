<s> Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
buf=input().split()
N=int(buf[0])
M=int(buf[1])

thres=10**9+7

if abs(N-M)==1:
    N=min(N,M)
    retVal=1
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        retVal*=(i**2)
        if retVal>=thres:
            retVal=retVal%thres
    retVal*=(N+1)
    if retVal>=thres:
        retVal=retVal%thres
    print(retVal) 
elif N==M:
    retVal=2
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        retVal*=(i**2)
        if retVal>=thres:
            retVal=retVal%thres
    print(retVal)
else:
    print(0)
```

### Input

The first line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M, the number of nodes in the first graph and the number of nodes in the second graph.

### Output

For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer, the number of edges in the union of the two graphs.

### Constraints

1 <= T <= 100

1 <= N, M <= 10^5

### Sample Input

```
2
10 10
10 10
```

### Sample Output

```
100
100
```

### Explanation

In the first test case, the two graphs have the same number of nodes, so the union of the two graphs has 100 nodes.

In the second test case, the two graphs have the same number of nodes, so the union of the two graphs has 100 nodes.
