@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
f, t = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
print(len([i for i in range(f, t+1) if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]]))
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int f = scanner.nextInt();
        int t = scanner.nextInt();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = f; i <= t; i++) {
            if (isPalindrome(i)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }

    private static boolean isPalindrome(int num) {
        String str = String.valueOf(num);
        int start = 0;
        int end = str.length() - 1;
        while (start < end) {
            if (str.charAt(start) != str.charAt(end)) {
                return false;
            }
            start++;
            end--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the user, then counts the number of palindromic numbers between these two integers (inclusive). A palindromic number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. The `isPalindrome` method checks if a number is palindromic.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
