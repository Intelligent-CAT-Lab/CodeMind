<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
s = input()

cnt = 0
l = 0

for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] == 'W':
        cnt += i-l
        l += 1

print(cnt)
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();

        int cnt = 0;
        int l = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'W') {
                cnt += i - l;
                l += 1;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(cnt);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a string from the user, then iterates over the string. If it encounters a 'W', it adds the difference between the current index and the last index to the count, and increments the last index. Finally, it prints the count.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
