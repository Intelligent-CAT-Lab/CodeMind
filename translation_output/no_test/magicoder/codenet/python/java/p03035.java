<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
A,B=map(int,input().split())
if A>=13:
  print(B)
elif 6<=A<=12:
  print(B//2)
else:
  print(0)
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java equivalent of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        if (A >= 13) {
            System.out.println(B);
        } else if (A >= 6 && A <= 12) {
            System.out.println(B / 2);
        } else {
            System.out.println(0);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the user, A and B, and then checks if A is greater than or equal to 13, in which case it prints B. If A is between 6 and 12 inclusive, it prints B divided by 2. Otherwise, it prints 0.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
