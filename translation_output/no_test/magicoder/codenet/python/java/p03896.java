<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
n=input()
for i in range(n-2/n):print-(n<3)or" ".join(`(i-~(j^(n%2<(j+2<n>i*2))))%n+1`for j in range(n-1))
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code you provided:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 2 / n; i++) {
            if (n < 3) {
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
                for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
                    sb.append((i - ~(j ^ (n % 2 < (j + 2 < n > i * 2))) % n + 1).toString());
                    if (j < n - 2) {
                        sb.append(" ");
                    }
                }
                System.out.println(sb.toString());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that the Python code you provided is quite complex and may not produce the expected output. The Java code provided is a direct translation of the Python code you provided. It may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your program.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
