<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
N,A,B = map(int,input().split())
if (A-B)%2==0:
  print((B-A)//2)
else:
  print(min(A-1,N-B)+1+(B-A)//2)
```

@@ Response
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        if ((A - B) % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println((B - A) / 2);
        } else {
            System.out.println(Math.min(A - 1, N - B) + 1 + (B - A) / 2);

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code you provided. It reads three integers from the user (N, A, and B), and then checks if the difference between A and B is even. If it is, it prints the result of dividing the difference between B and A by 2. If it's not, it prints the minimum of A - 1 and N - B, plus 1, plus the result of dividing the difference between B and A by 2.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
