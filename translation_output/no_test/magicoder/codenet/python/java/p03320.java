Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
K = int(input())
a = 0
d = 1
def snuke(x):
    a = 0
    while x>0:
        a += x%10
        x //= 10
    return a
for i in range(1, K+1):
    x = a + d
    y = a + 10*d
    if x/snuke(x) <= y/snuke(y):
        a = x
    else:
        a = y
        d *= 10

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code you provided. It reads an integer `K` from the standard input, initializes `a` and `d` to 0 and 1, and then iterates from 1 to `K`. For each iteration, it calculates `x` and `y`, checks if `x`/`snuke(x)` is less than or equal to `y`/`snuke(y)`, and updates `a` accordingly. Finally, it prints `a`. The `snuke` function is used to calculate the sum of digits of a number.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
