<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
S = input()
if S.count("AC") >= 1:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = scanner.nextLine();
        if (S.contains("AC")) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a string from the user, checks if the string contains the substring "AC", and prints "Yes" if it does, and "No" if it doesn't.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
