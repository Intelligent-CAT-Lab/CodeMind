<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
n,r = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

if n < 10:
    print(r + (100 * (10 - n)))
else:
    print(r)
```

@@ Response
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int r = scanner.nextInt();

        if (n < 10) {
            System.out.println(r + (100 * (10 - n)));
        } else {
            System.out.println(r);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the user, `n` and `r`, and then checks if `n` is less than 10. If it is, it prints `r` plus 100 times the difference between 10 and `n`. If `n` is not less than 10, it just prints `r`.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
