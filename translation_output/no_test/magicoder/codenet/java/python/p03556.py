@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class p03556 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {
			execute(scanner);
		}
	}

	private static void execute(Scanner scanner) {
		int r = (int) Math.sqrt(scanner.nextInt());
		System.out.println(r * r);
	}
}

```

@@ Response
```python
import math

def execute(scanner):
    n = int(scanner.readline())
    r = int(math.sqrt(n))
    print(r * r)

def main():
    try:
        execute(input)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this Python code, we use the `math` module to calculate the square root of a number. The `try` block is used to catch any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the `execute` function. The `main` function is the entry point of the program, and it calls the `execute` function with the `input` function as the argument. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` line is used to ensure that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly, but not when it's imported as a module.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
