@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

//?Â´??????Â°????Â§Â£?????????????????Â°??????
public class p02467 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long n = Long.parseLong(sc.nextLine());
		System.out.print(n + ":");
		for (int i = 2; n >= i * i;) {
			if (n % i == 0) {
				n = n / i;
				System.out.print(" " + i);
			} else {
				i++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(" " + n);
	}

}
```

@@ Response
Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
# Python program to find prime factors of a number

def prime_factors(n):
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

n = int(input())
print(f"{n}:", end="")
for i in prime_factors(n):
    print(f" {i}", end="")
print()
```

This Python program works by repeatedly dividing the input number by the smallest prime number that divides it. The prime factors are stored in a list, which is then printed out.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
