<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class p02817 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		String string = in.next();
		String tString = in.next();
		System.out.println(tString + string);
		in.close();
	}
}
```

@@ Response
Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
# Python code

# Get input from user
string = input()
tString = input()

# Print the concatenated string
print(tString + string)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It prompts the user to enter two strings, then it concatenates them and prints the result.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
