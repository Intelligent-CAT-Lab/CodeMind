<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
a = int ( input ( ) )
for i in range ( a , 0 , - 1 ) :
    if a % i == 0 :
        print ( i , end = ' â ' )
        a = i


```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        for (int i = a; i > 0; i--) {
            if (a % i == 0) {
                System.out.print(i + " ");
                a = i;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer from the user, then iterates from that number down to 1. If the current number is a divisor of the original number, it prints that number and updates the original number to be the current number.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
