* `import sys`: This line imports the `sys` module, which provides access to the standard input and output streams.
* `def main():`: This line defines a function called `main`.
* `N, M = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())`: This line reads a line from standard input, splits it into two integers using the `split()` method, and assigns the first integer to `N` and the second integer to `M`.
* `print(N * M)`: This line multiplies `N` and `M` and prints the result to standard output.
* `if __name__ == "__main__":`: This line checks if the current module is being run as the main program, and if so, it calls the `main()` function.
* `main()`: This line calls the `main()` function.
