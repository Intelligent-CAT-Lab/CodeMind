python code:

 #a = 314159265
#b = 358979323846264338
a, b = map(int, input().split())
count = 1
x = a
#print(x)
while x * 2 <= b:
    x = x * 2
    #print(x)
    count += 1
print(count)

Translate the above python code to java.

Here is the Java code equivalent to the Python code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int count = 1;
        int x = a;
        while (x * 2 <= b) {
            x = x * 2;
            count++;
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```
Note that the `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user, and the `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer value from the user. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the result to the console.</s>
