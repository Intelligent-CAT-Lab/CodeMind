python code:

N = int(input())

ans = 0
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    if i % 5 != 0 and i % 3 != 0:
        ans += i

print(ans)


Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code equivalent to the Python code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            if (i % 5 != 0 && i % 3 != 0) {
                ans += i;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```
Note that the `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user, and the `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer value from the user. The `for` loop is used to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to N, and the `if` statement is used to check if the current number is divisible by 5 or 3. If it is not, the number is added to the sum. Finally, the sum is printed to the console using the `System.out.println()` method.</s>
