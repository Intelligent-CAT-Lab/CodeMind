python code:

ab, bc = map(int, input().split())

fare = int(ab + bc/2)

print(fare)



Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code equivalent to the Python code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FareCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the length of the first side: ");
        int ab = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter the length of the second side: ");
        int bc = scanner.nextInt();
        int fare = (ab + bc) / 2;
        System.out.println("The fare is: " + fare);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `nextInt()` method to read the input as an integer. The `fare` variable is calculated by adding the two sides and dividing by 2. Finally, the `println()` method is used to print the fare to the console.</s>
