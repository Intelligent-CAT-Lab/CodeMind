Translate the above python code to java.

Here is the Java code for the above Python code:
```java

```
Note that the Java code is a bit more verbose than the Python code, as it includes some additional checks and error handling that are not present in the Python code. Additionally, the Java code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, while the Python code uses the `input()` function.</s>
