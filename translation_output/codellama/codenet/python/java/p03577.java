python code:

print(str(input())[:-8])

Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println(input.substring(0, input.length() - 8));
    }
}
```

Explanation:

* `import java.util.Scanner;` imports the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package, which is used to read input from the user.
* `public class Main {` declares a class called `Main`.
* `public static void main(String[] args) {` declares a method called `main` that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns nothing. This method is the entry point of the program.
* `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);` creates a new `Scanner` object that reads input from the user.
* `String input = scanner.nextLine();` reads a line of input from the user and stores it in a string variable called `input`.
* `System.out.println(input.substring(0, input.length() - 8));` prints the first 8 characters of the input string to the console.

Note that the Python code uses the `input()` function to read a line of input from the user, while the Java code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user. The rest of the code is similar in both languages.</s>
