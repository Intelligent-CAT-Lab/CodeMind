python code:

s=input()
i=c=p=0;b=''
while i<len(s):
    if s[i]==b:
        if c > p:r=b;p=c
        c=0
    b=s[i]
    i+=[3,7][s[i]=='c']
    c+=1
if c>p:r=b
print(['chicken','egg'][r=='e'])

Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

[/INST]
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ChickenEgg {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        int i = 0;
        int c = 0;
        int p = 0;
        char b = ' ';
        while (i < s.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == b) {
                if (c > p) {
                    r = b;
                    p = c;
                }
                c = 0;
            }
            b = s.charAt(i);
            i += (s.charAt(i) == 'c') ? 3 : 7;
            c++;
        }
        if (c > p) {
            r = b;
        }
        System.out.println(r == 'e' ? "chicken" : "egg");
    }
}
```
This code is similar to the Python code, but it uses Java's `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and it uses Java's `String` class to manipulate the input string. The logic for determining the most common letter in the string is the same as in the Python code, but it is written in Java syntax. The `r` variable is used to store the most common letter, and the `p` variable is used to store the number of times the most common letter appears in the string. The `c` variable is used to count the number of times each letter appears in the string. The `b` variable is used to store the current letter being processed. The `i` variable is used to keep track of the current index in the string. The `while` loop iterates over each letter in the string, and the `if` statement checks if the current letter is the same as the previous letter. If it is, the `c` variable is incremented. If it is not, the `c` variable is reset to 0, and the `b` variable is updated to the current letter. The `i` variable is incremented by 3 or 7 depending on whether the current letter is 'c' or not. The `while` loop continues until the end of the string is reached. Finally, the `r` variable is printed to the console, along with the appropriate message depending on whether it is 'e' or not.</s>
