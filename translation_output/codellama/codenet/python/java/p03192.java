python code:

N = raw_input()
print len([i for i in N if i == '2'])


Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String N = scanner.nextLine();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N.length(); i++) {
            if (N.charAt(i) == '2') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```

This code uses a `Scanner` object to read the input from the user, and then it uses a `for` loop to iterate over the characters in the input string. For each character, it checks if it is equal to the character '2', and if it is, it increments a counter variable. Finally, it prints the value of the counter variable, which is the number of times the character '2' appears in the input string.</s>
