python code:

import math
H, A = map(int, input().split())
print(math.ceil(H/A))

Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:

import java.util.Scanner;
import java.lang.Math;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int H = sc.nextInt();
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(Math.ceil(H/A));
    }
}

The code first imports the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package, which is used to read input from the user. It also imports the `Math` class from the `java.lang` package, which provides various mathematical functions, including the `ceil` function.

The `main` method is the entry point of the program, and it first creates a new `Scanner` object called `sc` to read input from the user. It then reads two integers `H` and `A` from the user using the `nextInt` method of the `Scanner` class.

The program then uses the `ceil` function from the `Math` class to calculate the ceiling of `H/A`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `H/A`. The result is then printed to the console using the `println` method of the `System` class.

Note that the `ceil` function in Java takes a double value as input, so we need to cast the result of `H/A` to a double before passing it to the `ceil` function.</s>
