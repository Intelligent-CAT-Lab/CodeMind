The Python code you provided is a bit complex and uses some advanced features of Python, such as the `input()` function, list comprehensions, and the `range()` function. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `n = input()`: This line prompts the user to enter a number, and the user's input is stored in the variable `n`.
2. `for i in range(n-2/n)`: This line iterates over a range of numbers from 0 to `n-2/n`. The `range()` function takes two arguments: the start and end of the range. In this case, the start is 0, and the end is `n-2/n`.
3. `print-(n<3)or" ".join(`(i-~(j^(n%2<(j+2<n>i*2))))%n+1`for j in range(n-1))` : This line prints a string that is constructed using the `join()` method. The `join()` method takes two arguments: a string to join, and a list of strings to join. In this case, the string to join is `" "` (a space), and the list of strings to join is a list of strings that are constructed using the `for` loop.
4. `for j in range(n-1)`: This line iterates over a range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
5. `(i-~(j^(n%2<(j+2<n>i*2))))%n+1`: This line is a complex expression that calculates a value based on the current values of `i` and `j`. The expression is too complex to explain in detail here, but it involves modular arithmetic and bitwise operations.

To translate this code to Java, you would need to replace the Python syntax with Java syntax. Here's an example of how you could do this:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 2 / n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
                int value = (i - ~(j ^ (n % 2 < (j + 2 < n > i * 2)))) % n + 1;
                System.out.print(value + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `System.out.print()` and `System.out.println()` methods to print output to the console. The `for` loops are used to iterate over the range of numbers, and the `^` operator is used for bitwise XOR. The `~` operator is used for bitwise NOT, and the `%` operator is used for modular arithmetic.

Note that this code is not equivalent to the Python code, as it does not use the `input()` function or the `range()` function. However, it should produce similar output for the same input.</s>
