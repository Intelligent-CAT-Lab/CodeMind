python code:

r=int(input())
print(3*(r**2))

Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AreaOfCircle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the radius of the circle: ");
        int r = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println("The area of the circle is: " + 3 * (r * r));
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `Math.pow()` method to calculate the square of the radius. The `Math.pow()` method takes two arguments: the base and the exponent. In this case, the base is the radius, and the exponent is 2. The result of the `Math.pow()` method is then multiplied by 3 to get the area of the circle.</s>
