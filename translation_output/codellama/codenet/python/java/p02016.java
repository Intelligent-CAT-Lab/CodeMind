python code:

print('square1001' if input()=='ani' else 'e869120')



Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        if (input.equals("ani")) {
            System.out.println("square1001");
        } else {
            System.out.println("e869120");
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, we first create a `Scanner` object to read input from the user. We then use the `nextLine()` method to read the input as a string.

Next, we use the `equals()` method to compare the input with the string "ani". If the input is equal to "ani", we print "square1001" to the console. Otherwise, we print "e869120".

Note that in Java, we use the `equals()` method to compare strings, rather than the `==` operator. This is because the `==` operator compares the memory addresses of the strings, rather than their contents.</s>
