Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println(s.substring(0, s.length() - 1));
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `substring` method to extract every other character from the input string. The `length` method is used to determine the length of the input string, and the `substring` method is used to extract every other character from the input string. Finally, the `println` method is used to print the resulting string to the console.</s>
