python code:

s = input()
print(s[:4] + ' ' + s[4:])

Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println(s.substring(0, 4) + " " + s.substring(4));
    }
}
```

In this code, we first create a `Scanner` object to read input from the user. We then use the `nextLine()` method to read a line of input from the user and store it in a `String` variable called `s`.

Next, we use the `substring()` method to extract the first 4 characters of the input string and the remaining characters. We then concatenate the two substrings with a space in between them using the `+` operator. Finally, we print the resulting string to the console using the `System.out.println()` method.

Note that the `substring()` method takes two arguments: the first argument is the starting index of the substring, and the second argument is the ending index of the substring. In this case, we are extracting the first 4 characters of the input string, so we use `0` as the starting index and `4` as the ending index.</s>
