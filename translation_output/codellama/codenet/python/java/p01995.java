This is the Java code for the given Python code. It uses the same logic and data structures as the Python code, but with Java syntax.

The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user, and the `Arrays` class is used to perform binary search on the `memo` array. The `dp` array is used to store the number of ways to split the string into two non-empty substrings, and the `ans` variable is used to store the final answer.

The `main` method first reads the input string from the user using the `Scanner` class, and then initializes the `alpha` array and the `memo` array. The `memo` array is used to store the indices of each character in the input string, and the `alpha` array is used to map each character to its corresponding index in the `memo` array.

The `main` method then initializes the `dp` array and sets the value of the first row and column to 1. This is because there is only one way to split the empty string into two non-empty substrings.

The `main` method then iterates over the input string, and for each character, it checks if it is the first or last character in the string. If it is the first character, it sets the value of the corresponding cell in the `dp` array to 1. If it is the last character, it sets the value of the corresponding cell in the `dp` array to the value of the previous cell.

The `main` method then iterates over the input string again, and for each character, it checks if it is the first or last character in the string. If it is the first character, it sets the value of the corresponding cell in the `dp` array to 1. If it is the last character, it sets the value of the corresponding cell in the `dp` array to the value of the previous cell.

The `main` method then iterates over the `dp` array, and for each cell, it checks if the value is greater than 0. If it is, it adds the value to the `ans` variable.

Finally, the `main` method prints the value of the `ans` variable, which is the final answer.

Note that the `ans` variable is initialized to 0, and it is incremented by the value of each cell in the `dp` array that is greater than 0. The `ans` variable is then printed at the end of the program.</s>
