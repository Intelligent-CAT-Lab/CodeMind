python code:

n = int(input())
print(int((n + 1) * n / 2)) 

Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println((n + 1) * n / 2);
    }
}
```

In this code, we first import the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package, which allows us to read input from the user. We then create a new `Scanner` object and use it to read an integer from the user. We store the input in the `n` variable.

Next, we use the `System.out.println()` method to print the result of the calculation. We use the `int` keyword to convert the result to an integer, since the `println()` method takes a `String` argument.

Finally, we use the `scanner.close()` method to close the `Scanner` object, which is a good practice to avoid resource leaks.</s>
