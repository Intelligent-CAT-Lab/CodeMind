python code:

n = int(input())

cnt = 0
for a in range(1, n):
    for b in range(1, n):
        x = a * b
        if x >= n:
            break
        cnt += 1

print(cnt)            


Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code equivalent to the Python code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            for (int b = 1; b <= n; b++) {
                int x = a * b;
                if (x >= n) {
                    break;
                }
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(cnt);
    }
}
```
Note that the `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user, and the `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer value from the user. The `for` loop is used to iterate over the range of values from 1 to `n`, and the `if` statement is used to check if the product of `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the loop is exited using the `break` statement. The `cnt` variable is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. Finally, the `System.out.println()` method is used to print the value of `cnt` to the console.</s>
