python code:

N = int(input())
ans = 0
x = 1
while 2*x-1 <= N:
    x = 2*x
    ans += 1
print(ans)



Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code equivalent to the Python code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int ans = 0;
        int x = 1;
        while (2*x-1 <= N) {
            x = 2*x;
            ans += 1;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```
Note that the `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user, and the `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer value from the user. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the result to the console.</s>
