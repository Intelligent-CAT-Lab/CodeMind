python code:

n,r = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

if n < 10:
    print(r + (100 * (10 - n)))
else:
    print(r)

Translate the above python code to java.

java code:

Here is the Java code equivalent to the Python code:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int r = scanner.nextInt();

        if (n < 10) {
            System.out.println(r + (100 * (10 - n)));
        } else {
            System.out.println(r);
        }
    }
}
```
Note that the `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user, and the `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer value from the user. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the output to the console.</s>
