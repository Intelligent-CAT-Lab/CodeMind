python Code:

print ( input ( ) . replace ( " , " , " â " ) )



Translate the above python code to java.

java Code:

[/INST]

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        String output = input.replace(",", " - ");
        System.out.println(output);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `nextLine()` method is used to read a line of input from the user.
* The `replace()` method is used to replace all occurrences of a substring with another substring. In this case, we are replacing all occurrences of `,` with ` - `.
* The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the output to the console.

Note: The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user, and the `System.out.println()` method is used to print output to the console. These are the most common ways to interact with the user in Java.</s>
