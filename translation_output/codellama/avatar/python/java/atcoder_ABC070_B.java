python Code:

a , b , c , d = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
print ( max ( 0 , min ( b , d ) - max ( a , c ) ) )



Translate the above python code to java.

java Code:

Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MaxMin {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        int max = Math.max(0, Math.min(b, d) - Math.max(a, c));
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}
```

In this code, we first import the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package, which we use to read input from the user. We then define a `main` method that takes an array of strings as an argument.

Inside the `main` method, we create a new `Scanner` object and use it to read four integers from the user. We then use the `Math.max` and `Math.min` methods to calculate the maximum and minimum values of the four integers, respectively.

Finally, we print the maximum value of the two minimum values, which is the same as the Python code.

Note that in Java, we use the `Math.max` and `Math.min` methods to calculate the maximum and minimum values of a set of numbers, respectively. These methods take a variable number of arguments, so we can pass in multiple values to calculate the maximum or minimum of. In the Python code, we use the `max` and `min` functions, which take a list of values as an argument and return the maximum or minimum value in the list.</s>
