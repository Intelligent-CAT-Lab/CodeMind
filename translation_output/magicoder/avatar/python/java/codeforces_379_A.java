@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
a , b = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
x = a
h = 0
s = 0
while x > 0 :
    x -= 1
    h += 1
    s += 1
while s // b != 0 :
    h += 1
    s = s - b + 1
print ( h )


```

@@ Response
Here is the Java equivalent of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String[] input = scanner.nextLine().split(" ");
        int a = Integer.parseInt(input[0]);
        int b = Integer.parseInt(input[1]);
        int x = a;
        int h = 0;
        int s = 0;
        while (x > 0) {
            x -= 1;
            h += 1;
            s += 1;
        }
        while (s / b != 0) {
            h += 1;
            s = s - b + 1;
        }
        System.out.println(h);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the user, `a` and `b`, and then performs the same operations as the Python code. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user, and the `split` method is used to split the input string into an array of strings. The `Integer.parseInt` method is used to convert each string in the array to an integer. The `while` loop is used to decrement `x` and increment `h` and `s` until `x` is less than or equal to 0. The `while` loop is then used to increment `h` and decrement `s` until `s` is less than `b`. Finally, the value of `h` is printed to the console.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
