@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class codeforces_544_B {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scan.nextInt();
        int count = scan.nextInt();
        printIsland(n, count);
    }

    public static void printIsland(int n, int count) {
        int a = (n + 1) / 2;
        int b = n / 2;
        int max = a * a + b * b;
        if (count > max) {
            System.out.println("NO");
            return;
        }
        System.out.println("YES");
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((i + j) % 2 == 0 && count > 0) {
                    sb.append('L');
                    count--;
                } else {
                    sb.append('S');
                }
            }
            sb.append("\n");
        }
    }
}

```python
def printIsland(n, count):
    a = (n + 1) // 2
    b = n // 2
    max = a * a + b * b
    if count > max:
        print("NO")
        return
    print("YES")
    sb = ""
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if (i + j) % 2 == 0 and count > 0:
                sb += 'L'
                count -= 1
            else:
                sb += 'S'
        sb += "\n"
    print(sb)

n = int(input())
count = int(input())
printIsland(n, count)
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the standard input, and then calls the `printIsland` function with these integers as arguments. The `printIsland` function checks if the count is greater than the maximum possible count, and if so, it prints "NO" and returns. If the count is less than or equal to the maximum possible count, it prints "YES" and then prints a grid of 'L's and 'S's. The grid is created by iterating over the range of n and appending 'L's and 'S's to a string. After each row is printed, a newline character is appended to the string. Finally, the string is printed.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
