<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.*;
public class p03697 {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		if (a + b >= 10) {
    		System.out.println("error"); 
		}
		else {
		    System.out.println(a + b);
		}
	}
}
```

@@ Response
Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
import sys

def main():
    a = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    b = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    if a + b >= 10:
        print("error")
    else:
        print(a + b)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads two integers from the standard input, checks if their sum is greater than or equal to 10, and prints "error" if it is, otherwise it prints the sum of the two integers.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
