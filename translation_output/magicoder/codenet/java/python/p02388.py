@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

class p02388 {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		int num = Integer.valueOf(br.readLine());
		System.out.println(num*num*num);
	}

}
```

@@ Response
```python
import sys

def main():
    num = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    print(num**3)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In Python, the equivalent code would be:

1. Import the `sys` module, which provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

2. Define a function `main()`. This function reads a number from the standard input (`sys.stdin.readline()`), converts it to an integer (`int()`), cubes it (`**3`), and prints the result.

3. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to execute `main()` only if the script is run directly (not imported as a module).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
