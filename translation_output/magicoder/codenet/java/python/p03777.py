@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.*;

public class p03777{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    String a = sc.next();
    String b = sc.next();
    if(a.equals(b)){
      System.out.println("H");
    }else{
      System.out.println("D");
    }
  }
}

```

@@ Response
Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
# Python does not require importing libraries like Java

# Python does not have a main function like Java
# Python uses indentation to define blocks of code

# Python uses input() function to get user input
a = input()
b = input()

# Python uses '==' for comparison instead of '.equals()'
if a == b:
    print("H")
else:
    print("D")
```

Please note that Python does not require importing libraries like Java, and it does not have a main function like Java. Also, Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, and it uses the `input()` function to get user input. Python uses `==` for comparison instead of `.equals()`.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
