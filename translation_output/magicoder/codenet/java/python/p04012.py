@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.*;

public class p04012 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String w = sc.next();
		char[] c = w.toCharArray();
		char a = 'a';
		int acha = (int)a;
		a = 'z';
		int zcha = (int)a;
		int count = 0;
		for (int i = acha; i < zcha + 1; i++) {
			for (char x: c) {
				if (x == (char)i) {
					count++;
				}
			}
			if (count % 2 == 1) {
				System.out.println("No");
				return;
			}
			count = 0;
		}
		System.out.println("Yes");
	}
}
```

@@ Response
Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
import sys

def main():
    w = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    c = list(w)
    a = 'a'
    acha = ord(a)
    a = 'z'
    zcha = ord(a)
    count = 0
    for i in range(acha, zcha + 1):
        for x in c:
            if x == chr(i):
                count += 1
        if count % 2 == 1:
            print("No")
            return
        count = 0
    print("Yes")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a string from the standard input, converts it to a list of characters, and then iterates over the ASCII values of the characters 'a' to 'z'. For each character, it counts the number of occurrences in the input string. If the count is odd, it prints "No" and exits. If it goes through all the characters without finding any odd counts, it prints "Yes".<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
