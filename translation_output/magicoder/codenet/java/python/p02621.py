<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.Scanner;
public class p02621
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
    {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int a  = sc.nextInt();
      System.out.println(a + (a*a) + (a*a*a));
    }
      
}    

```

@@ Response
Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
a = int(input())
print(a + (a*a) + (a*a*a))
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It prompts the user to input an integer, squares and cubes that integer, and then prints the sum of the original integer, the square, and the cube.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
