@@ Instruction
Translate the following java code to python and enclose your solution inside ```python```:
```
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class p01479 {
    static final int MAX = 1000000;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        String line = sc.next().replace("egg", "e").replace("chicken", "c");
        line = line.replace("ee", "e e").replace("ee", "e e")
                .replace("cc", "c c").replace("cc", "c c");
        String strs[] = line.split(" ");
        int max = 0;
        String ans = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < strs.length; i++) {
            if (max < strs[i].length()) {
                max = strs[i].length();
                ans = strs[i].charAt(max - 1) == 'e' ? "egg" : "chicken";
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

@@ Response
```python
import re

def main():
    line = input().replace("egg", "e").replace("chicken", "c")
    line = re.sub(r'ee', 'e e', line)
    line = re.sub(r'cc', 'c c', line)
    strs = line.split(" ")
    max_len = 0
    ans = ""
    for s in strs:
        if max_len < len(s):
            max_len = len(s)
            ans = "egg" if s[-1] == 'e' else "chicken"
    print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python code does the same thing as the Java code. It reads a line of input, replaces "egg" and "chicken" with "e" and "c", respectively, and then splits the line into words. It then iterates over the words, keeping track of the longest word and the word that ends with 'e' (which is presumably "egg"). Finally, it prints the word that ends with 'e' if it's longer than any other word, or "chicken" otherwise.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
