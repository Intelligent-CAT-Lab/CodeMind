<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
s=input()
ret=0
for i in range(len(s)):
    ret+=(i%2)-[0,1][int(s[i]=="p")]
print(ret)
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            ret += (i % 2) - (s.charAt(i) == 'p' ? 1 : 0);
        }
        System.out.println(ret);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a string from the user, then iterates over each character in the string. For each character, it calculates the remainder of the index divided by 2 and subtracts either 1 or 0 depending on whether the character is 'p'. The result is then added to the `ret` variable. Finally, it prints the `ret` variable.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
