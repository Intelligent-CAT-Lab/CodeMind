<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
N = raw_input()
print len([i for i in N if i == '2'])

```

@@ Response
Here is the Java equivalent of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String N = scanner.nextLine();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N.length(); i++) {
            if (N.charAt(i) == '2') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a string from the user, counts the number of '2' characters in the string, and then prints the count.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
