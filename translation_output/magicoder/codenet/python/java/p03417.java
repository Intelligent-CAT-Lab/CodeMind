<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
N, M = map(int, input().split())

if max(N,M) == 1 :
    print(1)
elif min(N,M) == 1 :
    print(N*M - 2)
else :
    print((N-2)*(M-2))

```

@@ Response
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int M = scanner.nextInt();

        if (Math.max(N, M) == 1) {
            System.out.println(1);

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code you provided. It reads two integers from the user, then checks if either of them is 1. If so, it prints 1. If neither is 1, it checks if one of them is 1. If so, it prints the product of the two numbers minus 2. If neither is 1, it prints the product of the two numbers minus 4 (since we subtract 2 from each side).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
