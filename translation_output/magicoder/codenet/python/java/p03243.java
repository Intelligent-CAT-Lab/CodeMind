<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
N=int(input())
X=P=0
for i in range(10) :
  P=i*111
  if X < N and N <= P :
    print(P)
  X=P
    
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int X = 0;
        int P = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            P = i * 111;
            if (X < N && N <= P) {
                System.out.println(P);
            }
            X = P;
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer from the user, then iterates over the numbers 0 through 9. For each number, it calculates `P = i * 111`. If `X < N` and `N <= P`, it prints `P`. Then, it updates `X = P`.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
