<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
def solve():
    n, d = map(int, input().split())
    print(-(-n//(2*d+1)))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    solve()

```

@@ Response
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(-(-n/(2*d+1)));
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the user, calculates the result of the expression `-(-n//(2*d+1))`, and prints the result.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
