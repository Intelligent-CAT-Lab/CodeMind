<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
x,a,b=map(int,input().split())
if b<=a:
  print('delicious')
elif (b-a)<=x:
  print('safe')
else:
  print('dangerous')
```

@@ Response
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        if (b <= a) {
            System.out.println("delicious");
        } else if ((b - a) <= x) {
            System.out.println("safe");
        } else {
            System.out.println("dangerous");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads three integers from the user, and then checks if the second integer is less than or equal to the first, if so it prints "delicious". If the second integer is greater than the first, it checks if the difference between the second and the first is less than or equal to the first integer, if so it prints "safe". If neither of these conditions are met, it prints "dangerous".<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
