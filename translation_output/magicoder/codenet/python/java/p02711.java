<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
Translate the following python code to java and enclose your solution inside ```java```:
```
N = input()

if "7" in N:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

@@ Response
Here is the Java version of the given Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String N = scanner.nextLine();

        if (N.contains("7")) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a line of input from the user, checks if the string "7" is present in the input, and prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" if it is not.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
