### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from itertools import groupby
def pack_consecutive_duplicates(list1):
    return [list(group) for key, group in groupby(list1)]
<Code>

What would be the return value of`pack_consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `pack_consecutive_duplicates` takes a list `list1` as input and returns a new list where consecutive duplicates are packed together.

The function uses the `groupby` function from the `itertools` module. `groupby` makes an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the input. The input to `groupby` is the list `list1`.

The `groupby` function groups the input by consecutive identical elements. It returns a tuple for each group, where the first element is the key (the consecutive identical element) and the second element is an iterator that produces the items in the group.

The function `pack_consecutive_duplicates` creates a new list by converting each group to a list and returning this new list.

For example, if the input is `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]`, the output will be `[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]`.

This is because `groupby` groups consecutive identical elements together. For example, `[0, 0]`, `[4, 4]`, and `[6, 6, 6]` are groups of consecutive identical elements.

The `pack_consecutive_duplicates` function packs these groups together into a new list.

So, the output of `pack_consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4])` is `[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]`.

<<<Output>>>
[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]
