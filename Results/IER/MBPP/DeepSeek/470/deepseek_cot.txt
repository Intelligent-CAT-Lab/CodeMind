### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def add_pairwise(test_tup):
  res = tuple(i + j for i, j in zip(test_tup, test_tup[1:]))
  return (res) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of`add_pairwise((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add_pairwise` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input. The tuple contains integers. The function returns a new tuple where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in `test_tup` and the next element in `test_tup`.

The function uses the `zip` function to pair up the elements of `test_tup`. The `zip` function takes two or more iterables and returns a list of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. In this case, it pairs up the elements of `test_tup` and the next element in `test_tup`.

The function then uses a generator expression to create the new tuple. The generator expression iterates over the pairs of elements returned by `zip` and adds the elements of each pair together.

Finally, the function returns the new tuple.

For example, if `test_tup` is `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, the function would return `(6, 12, 15, 18, 10)`.

The first element of the new tuple is the sum of the first and second elements of `test_tup`, which is `1 + 5 = 6`. The second element of the new tuple is the sum of the second and third elements of `test_tup`, which is `5 + 7 = 12`. The third element of the new tuple is the sum of the third and fourth elements of `test_tup`, which is `7 + 8 = 15`. The fourth element of the new tuple is the sum of the fourth and fifth elements of `test_tup`, which is `8 + 10 = 18`. The fifth element of the new tuple is the sum of the fifth and sixth elements of `test_tup`, which is `10 + 10 = 20`.

So, the output of `add_pairwise((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))` would be `(6, 12, 15, 18, 10)`.

<<<Output>>>
(6, 12, 15, 18, 10)
