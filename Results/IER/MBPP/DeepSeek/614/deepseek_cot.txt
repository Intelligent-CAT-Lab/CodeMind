### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def cummulative_sum(test_list):
  res = sum(map(sum, test_list))
  return (res)
<Code>

What would be the return value of`cummulative_sum([(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `cummulative_sum` takes a list of tuples as input. The list contains tuples, where each tuple contains integers. The function is supposed to return the sum of all integers in all tuples.

The function uses the `map` function to apply the `sum` function to each tuple in the list. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of all integers in a tuple. The `map` function returns a map object, which is an iterator, so it needs to be converted to a list using the `list` function.

The `sum` function is then used again to calculate the sum of all sums. This is the final result.

The input `(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)` is a list of tuples. The first tuple contains the integers 1 and 3, the second tuple contains the integers 5, 6 and 7, and the third tuple contains the integers 2 and 6.

The output of the function `cummulative_sum` with this input would be 28, which is the sum of all integers in all tuples.
<<<Output>>>
28
