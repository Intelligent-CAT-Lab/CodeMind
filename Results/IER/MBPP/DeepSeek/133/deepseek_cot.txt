### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_negativenum(nums):
  sum_negativenum = list(filter(lambda nums:nums<0,nums))
  return sum(sum_negativenum)
<Code>

What would be the return value of`sum_negativenum([2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_negativenum` takes a list of integers `nums` as input.
The function uses the `filter` function to create a new list `sum_negativenum` that contains only the negative numbers from the input list `nums`. The `filter` function uses a lambda function as its first argument, which is a function that takes a number and returns `True` if the number is negative and `False` otherwise.
The `sum` function is then used to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the `sum_negativenum` list.
Finally, the sum of all negative numbers in the input list `nums` is returned by the function.

In the given example, the input list is `[2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17]`. The negative numbers in this list are `-6`, `-9`, `-12` and `-5`. Their sum is `-33`.

So, the output of the code would be `-33`.
<<<Output>>>
-33
