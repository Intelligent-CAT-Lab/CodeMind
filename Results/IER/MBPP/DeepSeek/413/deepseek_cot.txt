### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def extract_nth_element(list1, n):
    result = [x[n] for x in list1]
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of`extract_nth_element([('Greyson Fulton', 98, 99), ('Brady Kent', 97, 96), ('Wyatt Knott', 91, 94), ('Beau Turnbull', 94, 98)] ,0)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_nth_element` takes a list of tuples and an integer n as input. The list contains tuples, where each tuple represents a student's name and their scores in two subjects. The integer n represents the index of the element in the tuple to be extracted.

The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each tuple in the list. For each tuple, it extracts the nth element and adds it to the result list.

In the given example, the function is called with a list of tuples and n=0. This means it will extract the first element (i.e., the student's name) from each tuple in the list.

The output of the function will be a list of student names extracted from the tuples.

The list of tuples provided in the example is:
[('Greyson Fulton', 98, 99), ('Brady Kent', 97, 96), ('Wyatt Knott', 91, 94), ('Beau Turnbull', 94, 98)]

The function will extract the first element from each tuple, resulting in the list:
['Greyson Fulton', 'Brady Kent', 'Wyatt Knott', 'Beau Turnbull']

So, the output of `extract_nth_element([('Greyson Fulton', 98, 99), ('Brady Kent', 97, 96), ('Wyatt Knott', 91, 94), ('Beau Turnbull', 94, 98)], 0)` will be `['Greyson Fulton', 'Brady Kent', 'Wyatt Knott', 'Beau Turnbull']`.

<<<Output>>>
['Greyson Fulton', 'Brady Kent', 'Wyatt Knott', 'Beau Turnbull']
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
