### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def move_zero(num_list):
    a = [0 for i in range(num_list.count(0))]
    x = [i for i in num_list if i != 0]
    return x + a
<Code>

What would be the return value of`move_zero([1,0,2,0,3,4])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `move_zero` takes a list `num_list` as input.

First, it counts the number of zeros in the list `num_list` and creates a new list `a` with the same number of zeros.

Then, it creates a new list `x` with all the non-zero elements from `num_list`.

Finally, it returns the concatenation of `x` and `a`.

In the given example, `num_list` is [1,0,2,0,3,4]. There are two zeros in `num_list`, so `a` is [0, 0].

The list `x` contains all non-zero elements from `num_list`, which are [1,2,3,4].

So, the function `move_zero` returns `x + a`, which is [1,2,3,4,0,0].

<<<Output>>>
[1,2,3,4,0,0]
