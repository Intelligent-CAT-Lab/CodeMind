The function `find_Index(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the index of the first term in the sequence of square roots of consecutive powers of 10 that is greater than or equal to `n`.

The variable `x` is initialized to the square root of `2 * 10^(n - 1)`. This is the formula used to calculate the nth term in the sequence of square roots of consecutive powers of 10.

The `round()` function is used to round `x` to the nearest integer. This is the index of the first term in the sequence of square roots of consecutive powers of 10 that is greater than or equal to `n`.

The `round()` function rounds `x` to the nearest integer. This is because the index of the sequence is an integer.

The `math.sqrt()` function is used to calculate the square root of a number. This is used to calculate the nth term in the sequence of square roots of consecutive powers of 10.

The `math.pow()` function is used to calculate the power of a number. This is used to calculate the nth term in the sequence of square roots of consecutive powers of 10.

The `round()` function is used to round `x` to the nearest integer. This is because the index of the sequence is an integer.
