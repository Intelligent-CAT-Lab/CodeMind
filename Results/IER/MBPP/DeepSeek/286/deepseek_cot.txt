### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_sub_array_sum_repeated(a, n, k): 
	max_so_far = -2147483648
	max_ending_here = 0
	for i in range(n*k): 
		max_ending_here = max_ending_here + a[i%n] 
		if (max_so_far < max_ending_here): 
			max_so_far = max_ending_here 
		if (max_ending_here < 0): 
			max_ending_here = 0
	return max_so_far
<Code>

What would be the return value of`max_sub_array_sum_repeated([10, 20, -30, -1], 4, 3)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_sub_array_sum_repeated` takes three parameters: a list `a` of integers, an integer `n` representing the length of the subarray, and an integer `k` representing the number of times the array is repeated.

The variable `max_so_far` is initialized to the smallest possible integer value, which will be used to keep track of the maximum sum found so far.

The variable `max_ending_here` is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the maximum sum ending at the current position.

The code then enters a loop that iterates `n*k` times. This means it will consider `n*k` elements from the array `a`.

For each element `a[i%n]` in this range, it adds the value of `a[i%n]` to `max_ending_here`.

If `max_so_far` is less than `max_ending_here`, it updates `max_so_far` with the value of `max_ending_here`.

If `max_ending_here` is negative, it resets `max_ending_here` to 0.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of `max_so_far`, which is the maximum sum of a subarray that can be obtained by summing up `k` repetitions of the array `a`.

In the given example, `a` is [10, 20, -30, -1], `n` is 4, and `k` is 3. The maximum sum of a subarray that can be obtained by summing up 3 repetitions of the array `a` is 30.

<<<Output>>>
30
