### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def count_Primes_nums(n):
    ctr = 0
    for num in range(n):
        if num <= 1:
            continue
        for i in range(2,num):
            if (num % i) == 0:
                break
        else:
            ctr += 1
    return ctr
<Code>

What would be the return value of`count_Primes_nums(5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_Primes_nums(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of prime numbers less than `n`.

The variable `ctr` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of prime numbers.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to `n` (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.

For each number `num` in this range, it checks if `num` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next number.

If `num` is greater than 1, it enters another loop that iterates from 2 to `num`. For each iteration, it checks if `num` is divisible by the current number `i`. If it is, it breaks the inner loop and proceeds to the next number.

If `num` is not divisible by any number `i` in the range, it means `num` is a prime number. The `else` clause of the inner loop is executed, which increments the `ctr` by 1.

After the outer loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `ctr`, which is 3.

So, the prime numbers less than 5 are 2, 3 and 5.

<<<Output>>>
3
