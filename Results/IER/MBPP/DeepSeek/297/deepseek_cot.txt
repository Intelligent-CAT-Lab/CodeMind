### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def flatten_list(list1):
    result_list = []
    if not list1: return result_list
    stack = [list(list1)]
    while stack:
        c_num = stack.pop()
        next = c_num.pop()
        if c_num: stack.append(c_num)
        if isinstance(next, list):
            if next: stack.append(list(next))
        else: result_list.append(next)
    result_list.reverse()
    return result_list 
<Code>

What would be the return value of`flatten_list([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `flatten_list` takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened list.

The variable `result_list` is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to accumulate the flattened list.

The code then checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns an empty list.

The variable `stack` is initialized to a list containing a copy of the input list. This is done to facilitate the process of flattening the list.

The code enters a loop that continues until the stack is empty. In each iteration of the loop, the code pops the last element from the stack.

If the popped element is a list, the code checks if it is not empty. If it is not, the code appends the list to the stack.

If the popped element is not a list, the code appends it to `result_list`.

After the loop finishes, the code reverses `result_list` and returns it.

The input `[0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]` is a nested list. The code will flatten this list by popping elements from the stack and appending them to `result_list` until the stack is empty.

The flattened list will be `[0, 10, 40, 50, 90, 100, 110, 120, 60, 70, 80, 30, 20]`.

<<<Output>>>
[0, 10, 40, 50, 90, 100, 110, 120, 60, 70, 80, 30, 20]
