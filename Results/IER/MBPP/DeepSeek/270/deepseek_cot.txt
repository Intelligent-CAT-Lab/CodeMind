### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_even_and_even_index(arr):  
    i = 0
    sum = 0
    for i in range(0, len(arr),2): 
        if (arr[i] % 2 == 0) : 
            sum += arr[i]  
    return sum
<Code>

What would be the return value of`sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_even_and_even_index` takes a list `arr` as input.

The variable `i` is initialized to 0, which will be used as the index to traverse the list.

The variable `sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of even numbers at even indices.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list `arr` with a step of 2, meaning it will consider elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) in the list.

For each element `arr[i]` in this range, the code checks if it is an even number. If it is, it adds the current number `arr[i]` to `sum`.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `sum`, which is the sum of even numbers at even indices in the list.

In the given list [5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8], the numbers at even indices are 6 (at index 1) and 8 (at index 5). Both are even numbers, so the sum is 14.

<<<Output>>>
14
