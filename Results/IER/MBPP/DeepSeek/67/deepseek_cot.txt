### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def bell_number(n):   
    bell = [[0 for i in range(n+1)] for j in range(n+1)] 
    bell[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1): 
        bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]  
        for j in range(1, i+1): 
            bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]   
    return bell[n][0] 
<Code>

What would be the return value of`bell_number(2)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `bell_number(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Bell number.

The Bell number is a sequence of numbers that appear in various counting problems in combinatorics. The sequence begins 1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, 21147, ...

The Bell number B(n) is defined by the sum of Bell(i, n-1) for i from 0 to n-1. The Bell number B(n, k) is the number of ways to partition a set of n labeled elements into k non-empty unlabeled subsets.

The code initializes a 2D list `bell` with size (n+1)*(n+1) filled with zeros. The first element `bell[0][0]` is set to 1.

Then it enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates from 1 to i (inclusive).

In the outer loop, `bell[i][0]` is set to `bell[i-1][i-1]`. This is because the first element of the i-th row is the same as the (i-1)-th element of the (i-1)-th row.

In the inner loop, `bell[i][j]` is set to `bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]`. This is because the j-th element of the i-th row is the sum of the (j-1)-th element of the i-th row and the j-th element of the (i-1)-th row.

Finally, the code returns `bell[n][0]`, which is the nth Bell number.

<<<Output>>>
The output of `bell_number(2)` would be 2.
