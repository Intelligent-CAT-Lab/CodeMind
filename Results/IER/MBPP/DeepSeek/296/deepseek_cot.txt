### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_Inv_Count(arr): 
    inv_count = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)): 
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)): 
            if (arr[i] > arr[j]): 
                inv_count += 1
    return inv_count 
<Code>

What would be the return value of`get_Inv_Count([1,20,6,4,5])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_Inv_Count(arr)` takes a list `arr` as input and returns the number of inversions in the list. An inversion is defined as a pair of elements in the list where the first element is greater than the second element.

The variable `inv_count` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of inversions.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements in the list `arr`. For each element `arr[i]` in the list, it enters another loop that iterates over the elements in the list starting from the next index of `arr[i]` to the end of the list.

For each pair of elements `(arr[i], arr[j])`, where `i < j`, the code checks if `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`. If it is, it increments `inv_count` by 1, indicating that there is an inversion.

After the loops finish, the code returns the final value of `inv_count`, which is the total number of inversions in the list.

For the input `[1,20,6,4,5]`, the code will compare each pair of elements and increment `inv_count` if an inversion is found. The pairs that will be compared are (1,20), (1,6), (1,4), (1,5), (20,6), (20,4), (20,5), (6,4), (6,5), (4,5). The inversions are (20,1), (6,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,20), (4,20), (5,20), (4,6), (5,6), (5,4). So, there are 10 inversions in the list, and the function `get_Inv_Count([1,20,6,4,5])` will return 10.

<<<Output>>>
10
