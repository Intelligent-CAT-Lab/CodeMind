### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_digits(nums):
    return sum(int(el) for n in nums for el in str(n) if el.isdigit())
<Code>

What would be the return value of`sum_of_digits([10,2,56])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_of_digits` takes a list of integers as input. It will return the sum of all digits in the list.

The input list `[10,2,56]` is passed to the function.

The function starts by initializing a variable `total` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of all digits.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over each number `n` in the input list. For each number `n`, it converts the number to a string and then iterates over each character `el` in the string.

If the character `el` is a digit (i.e., `el.isdigit()` is True), it converts `el` back to an integer and adds it to `total`.

After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `total`, which is the sum of all digits in the input list.

The sum of the digits in the list `[10,2,56]` is calculated as follows:
- For the number 10, the digits are 1 and 0, so the sum is 1 + 0 = 1.
- For the number 2, the digit is 2, so the sum is 2.
- For the number 56, the digits are 5 and 6, so the sum is 5 + 6 = 11.

So the total sum is 1 + 2 + 11 = 14.

<<<Output>>>
14
