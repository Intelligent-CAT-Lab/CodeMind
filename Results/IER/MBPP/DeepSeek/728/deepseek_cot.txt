### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_list(lst1,lst2):
  res_list = [lst1[i] + lst2[i] for i in range(len(lst1))] 
  return res_list
<Code>

What would be the return value of`sum_list([10,20,30],[15,25,35])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_list` takes two lists `lst1` and `lst2` as input. It returns a new list `res_list` where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in `lst1` and `lst2`.

The length of `lst1` and `lst2` is assumed to be the same. The code uses a list comprehension to create `res_list`. The list comprehension iterates over the indices of `lst1` (or `lst2`, since their lengths are the same), and for each index `i`, it adds the `i`th element of `lst1` and the `i`th element of `lst2` together.

So, for the input `sum_list([10,20,30],[15,25,35])`, the code would do the following:
- For `i=0`, it adds `10+15` (the 0th element of `lst1` and `lst2`) to `res_list`.
- For `i=1`, it adds `20+25` (the 1st element of `lst1` and `lst2`) to `res_list`.
- For `i=2`, it adds `30+35` (the 2nd element of `lst1` and `lst2`) to `res_list`.

Finally, it returns the list `res_list`, which is `[25, 45, 65]`.
<<<Output>>>
[25, 45, 65]
