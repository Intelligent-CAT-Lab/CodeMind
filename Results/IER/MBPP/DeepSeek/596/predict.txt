The function `tuple_size` takes a tuple list as input and returns the size of the tuple list in bytes. The `sys.getsizeof()` function returns the size of an object in bytes.

In the given example, the input is a tuple `("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3)`. The function `sys.getsizeof()` is called with this tuple as an argument.

The `sys.getsizeof()` function calculates the size of the tuple list in bytes. The size includes the memory used by the tuple itself and the memory used by the elements of the tuple. The size of the elements of the tuple is calculated separately by `sys.getsizeof()`.

The output of the function `tuple_size` will be the size of the tuple list in bytes.

The size of the tuple list is calculated as follows:
- The size of the tuple list is the sum of the sizes of the tuple and the elements of the tuple.
- The size of the tuple is the sum of the sizes of the elements of the tuple.
- The size of each element of the tuple is calculated by `sys.getsizeof()`.

The size of the elements of the tuple is calculated as follows:
- The size of each element of the tuple is the sum of the sizes of the element and the memory used by the element.
- The size of each element of the tuple is calculated by `sys.getsizeof()`.

The size of the tuple list and the size of the elements of the tuple are calculated separately by `sys.getsizeof()`.

The size of the tuple list and the size of the elements of the tuple are not the same because the size of the tuple list includes the memory used by the elements of the tuple, while the size of the elements of the tuple does not include the memory used by the tuple itself.

The size of the tuple list and the size of the elements of the tuple are calculated separately because `sys.getsizeof()` calculates the size of the tuple list and the elements of the tuple separately.
