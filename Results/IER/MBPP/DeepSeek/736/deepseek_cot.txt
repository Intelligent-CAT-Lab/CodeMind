### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import bisect
def left_insertion(a, x):
    i = bisect.bisect_left(a, x)
    return i
<Code>

What would be the return value of`left_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `left_insertion(a, x)` takes a sorted list `a` and a number `x` as input. The function uses the `bisect` module in Python, which provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without having to sort the list after each insertion. The `bisect_left` function is used to find the insertion point for `x` in `a` to maintain sorted order.

The `bisect_left` function returns the insertion point which would be used before the existing elements. If `x` is already present in `a`, the insertion point is before (to the left of) any existing entries.

In the given example, the function `left_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)` is called. The list `a` is [1,2,4,5] and `x` is 6. The function will return the index where 6 should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list.

The `bisect_left` function works by finding the insertion point for `x` in `a` to maintain sorted order. It does this by using a binary search algorithm. It starts by comparing `x` with the middle element of `a`. If `x` is equal to the middle element, it returns the middle index. If `x` is less than the middle element, it continues the search in the left half of `a`. If `x` is greater than the middle element, it continues the search in the right half of `a`. This process is repeated until `x` is found or the search space is exhausted.

In the given example, `x` is 6 and `a` is [1,2,4,5]. The middle element is 4. Since 6 is greater than 4, the search continues in the right half of `a`. The middle element in this half is 5. Since 6 is greater than 5, the search continues in the right half of this half. Now the search space is exhausted and `x` is not found in `a`. The function returns the index where `x` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`.

So, the output of `left_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)` would be 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
