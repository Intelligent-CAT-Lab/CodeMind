### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math 
def div_sum(n): 
  total = 1
  i = 2

  while i * i <= n:
    if (n % i == 0):
      total = (total + i + math.floor(n / i))
    i += 1

  return total

def are_equivalent(num1, num2): 
    return div_sum(num1) == div_sum(num2); 
<Code>

What would be the return value of`are_equivalent(36, 57)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `div_sum(n)` takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of all divisors of n.

The variable `total` is initialized to 1, which will be used to accumulate the sum of divisors.

The variable `i` is initialized to 2, which will be used to iterate through all numbers from 2 to sqrt(n).

The code then enters a loop that continues as long as i * i is less than or equal to n.

For each number i in this range, the code checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, i and n / i are added to total.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of total.

The function `are_equivalent(num1, num2)` takes two integers num1 and num2 as input and returns True if the sum of divisors of num1 is equal to the sum of divisors of num2, and False otherwise.

In the case of `are_equivalent(36, 57)`, the function `div_sum(36)` returns 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 60, and `div_sum(57)` returns 1 + 57 + 57 = 115. Since 60 is not equal to 115, the function `are_equivalent(36, 57)` returns False.

<<<Output>>>
False
