### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def pair_xor_Sum(arr,n) : 
    ans = 0 
    for i in range(0,n) :    
        for j in range(i + 1,n) :   
            ans = ans + (arr[i] ^ arr[j])          
    return ans 
<Code>

What would be the return value of`pair_xor_Sum([5,9,7,6],4)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `pair_xor_Sum` takes an array `arr` and its length `n` as input. The function calculates the sum of the bitwise XOR of all pairs of numbers in the array.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of XOR operations.

The code then enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over the array elements, and the inner loop starts from the next element of the current outer loop iteration. This ensures that each pair of numbers is processed only once.

For each pair of numbers `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`, the code calculates the XOR of the two numbers and adds it to `ans`. The XOR operation is performed using the `^` operator in Python.

After the loops finish, the code returns the final value of `ans`, which is the sum of the XOR operations of all pairs of numbers in the array.

The XOR operation is a binary operation that takes two bits, `x` and `y`, and produces a bit `z` such that `z = x XOR y`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then `z` is `1`; otherwise, `z` is `0`.

In the given example, `pair_xor_Sum([5,9,7,6],4)`, the pairs are (5,9), (5,7), (5,6), (9,7), (9,6), (7,6). The XOR operations are calculated as follows:

- (5,9): 5 ^ 9 = 12
- (5,7): 5 ^ 7 = 2
- (5,6): 5 ^ 6 = 3
- (9,7): 9 ^ 7 = 2
- (9,6): 9 ^ 6 = 3
- (7,6): 7 ^ 6 = 5

The sum of these XOR operations is 12 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 30.

So, the output of `pair_xor_Sum([5,9,7,6],4)` would be 30.
<<<Output>>>
30
