### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from itertools import groupby
def consecutive_duplicates(nums):
    return [key for key, group in groupby(nums)] 
<Code>

What would be the return value of`consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4 ])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `consecutive_duplicates` takes a list of integers `nums` as input. It uses the `groupby` function from the `itertools` module to group consecutive duplicates in the list.

The `groupby` function works by taking an iterable (in this case, `nums`) and a key function (in this case, the identity function, which returns the input unchanged). It returns an iterable of tuples, where the first element of each tuple is the key (the value of the input at the start of each group of consecutive duplicates), and the second element is an iterable of the consecutive duplicates.

In this case, the key function is the identity function, which means that the key for each group is the value of the input at the start of the group. The `groupby` function groups the input by this key, so it groups consecutive duplicates together.

The function then returns a list of the keys, which are the values of the input at the start of each group of consecutive duplicates.

For the input `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]`, the output would be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]`.

This is because `groupby` groups consecutive duplicates together, so it groups `0, 0` together, `4, 4` together, and `6, 6, 6` together. The other numbers have only one consecutive duplicate each, so they are returned as they are.

So the output of `consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4])` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]`.

<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]
