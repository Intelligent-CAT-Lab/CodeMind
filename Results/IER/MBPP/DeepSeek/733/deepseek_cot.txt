### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_first_occurrence(A, x):
    (left, right) = (0, len(A) - 1)
    result = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if x == A[mid]:
            result = mid
            right = mid - 1
        elif x < A[mid]:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of`find_first_occurrence([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_first_occurrence` takes a sorted list `A` and a number `x` as input. The goal is to find the first occurrence of `x` in `A`.

The variables `left` and `right` are initialized to the start and end indices of `A`, respectively. `result` is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the index of the first occurrence of `x`.

The code then enters a while loop that continues until `left` is greater than `right`. In each iteration of the loop, the code calculates the middle index `mid` of the current range.

If `x` is equal to the element at index `mid` in `A`, it means that `x` is found. The code then updates `result` to `mid` and moves the `right` pointer to `mid - 1` to continue searching for the first occurrence.

If `x` is less than the element at index `mid`, it means that `x` must be in the left half of the current range. So, the code moves the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.

If `x` is greater than the element at index `mid`, it means that `x` must be in the right half of the current range. So, the code moves the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of `result`, which is the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `A`.

In the given example, `find_first_occurrence([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)`, the output would be 1.

<<<Output>>>
1
