### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def average_tuple(nums):
    result = [sum(x) / len(x) for x in zip(*nums)]
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of`average_tuple(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4)))`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `average_tuple` takes a tuple of tuples `nums` as input. The tuple `nums` contains multiple tuples, where each tuple contains integers. The function calculates the average of each tuple and returns a list of these averages.

The function uses the `zip(*nums)` function to transpose the tuples. This means that it groups the first elements of each tuple together, the second elements together, and so on. The `*` operator is used to unpack the tuples in `nums`.

The function then uses a list comprehension to calculate the average of each group of numbers. The `sum(x) / len(x)` expression calculates the average of the numbers in `x`, where `x` is a group of numbers.

Finally, the function returns the list of averages.

The input `((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))` is a tuple of tuples where each tuple contains four integers.

The output of the function will be a list of averages, calculated for each group of numbers in the input tuples.

For example, the average of the first group of numbers (10, 10, 10, 12) is (10+10+10+12)/4 = 10.5.

The function will return a list of these averages.

<<<Output>>>
[10.5, 42.5, 50.5, 2.5]
