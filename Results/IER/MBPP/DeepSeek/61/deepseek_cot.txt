### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from collections import defaultdict
def count_Substrings(s):
    n = len(s)
    count,sum = 0,0
    mp = defaultdict(lambda : 0)
    mp[0] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        sum += ord(s[i]) - ord('0')
        count += mp[sum - (i + 1)]
        mp[sum - (i + 1)] += 1
    return count
<Code>

What would be the return value of`count_Substrings('112112')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_Substrings(s)` takes a string `s` as input and returns the count of substrings in `s` that have the same sum of digits on the left and right side of the substring.

The variable `n` is initialized to the length of the string `s`.

The variables `count` and `sum` are initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of substrings and the sum of digits respectively.

A dictionary `mp` is created using `defaultdict` from the `collections` module. The default value of all keys in `mp` is 0.

The dictionary `mp` is then incremented by 1 at index 0, indicating that there is 1 substring with a sum of 0.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character `s[i]` in the string `s`. For each character, the ASCII value of the character is subtracted from the ASCII value of '0' to get the integer value of the character, and this value is added to `sum`.

The code then increments `count` by the value of `mp[sum - (i + 1)]`. This is done because `mp[sum - (i + 1)]` gives the count of substrings ending at index `i` that have the same sum of digits on the left and right side of the substring.

Finally, the code increments `mp[sum - (i + 1)]` by 1, indicating that there is now 1 more substring ending at index `i` with the same sum of digits on the left and right side of the substring.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `count`, which is the count of substrings in `s` that have the same sum of digits on the left and right side of the substring.

For the string '112112', the output would be 4. There are 4 substrings that have the same sum of digits on the left and right side: '11', '2112', '12', '112112'.

<<<Output>>>
4
