The output of `is_samepatterns(["red","green","green"], ["a", "b", "b"])` would be `True`.

Explanation: The function checks if the patterns "a", "b", and "b" correspond to the colors "red", "green", and "green" respectively. Since all colors correspond to the same pattern, the function returns `True`.
