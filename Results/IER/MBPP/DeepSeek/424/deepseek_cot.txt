### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def extract_rear(test_tuple):
  res = list(sub[len(sub) - 1] for sub in test_tuple)
  return (res) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of`extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') )`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_rear` takes a tuple of strings as input. It then creates a list of the last elements of the strings in the tuple.

In the given example, the input is `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`.

The code iterates over each element in the tuple, and for each element, it takes the length of the element and subtracts 1 to get the index of the last character. It then uses this index to access the character at that position in the string. This character is added to the list.

Finally, the function returns the list of last characters.

The output of the function `extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers'))` would be `['s', 'r', 's']`.

<<<Output>>>
['s', 'r', 's']
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

This is because 'Mers' ends with 's', 'for' ends with 'r', and 'Vers' ends with 's'.
