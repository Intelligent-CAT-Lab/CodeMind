The output of `all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(4,1,2)` would be `False`.

The binary representation of 4 is 100. The binary representation of 3 is 011. The binary representation of 2 is 010. The binary representation of 1 is 001.

The range from 1 to 2 in the binary representation of 4 is 010. The binary representation of 4 is not equal to 010, so the function returns `False`.
