### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(n,l,r):  
    num = (((1 << r) - 1) ^ ((1 << (l - 1)) - 1)) 
    new_num = n & num
    if (new_num == 0): 
        return True
    return False
<Code>

What would be the return value of`all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(4,1,2)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(n,l,r)` takes three parameters: `n`, `l`, and `r`. 

The variable `n` is an integer that we want to check if all bits are set in the range from `l` to `r`. 

The variable `l` and `r` are the left and right boundaries of the range, respectively. 

The code first calculates a number `num` using bitwise operations. The number `num` is a bitmask that has all bits set from `l` to `r`. 

The bitwise operation `(1 << r) - 1` generates a number with all bits set up to position `r`. The bitwise operation `(1 << (l - 1)) - 1` generates a number with all bits set up to position `l-1`. The bitwise XOR operation `^` is used to invert all bits in the range from `l` to `r` in the number `num`.

The code then calculates a new number `new_num` by performing a bitwise AND operation between `n` and `num`. 

The code checks if `new_num` is equal to 0. If it is, it means that all bits in the range from `l` to `r` in `n` are set, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

<<<Output>>>
The output of `all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(4,1,2)` would be `False`.

The binary representation of 4 is 100. The binary representation of 3 is 011. The binary representation of 2 is 010. The binary representation of 1 is 001.

The range from 1 to 2 in the binary representation of 4 is 010. The binary representation of 4 is not equal to 010, so the function returns `False`.
