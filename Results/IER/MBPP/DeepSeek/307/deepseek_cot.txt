### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from copy import deepcopy
def colon_tuplex(tuplex,m,n):
  tuplex_colon = deepcopy(tuplex)
  tuplex_colon[m].append(n)
  return tuplex_colon
<Code>

What would be the return value of`colon_tuplex(("HELLO", 5, [], True) ,2,50)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `colon_tuplex` takes three arguments: a tuple, an integer `m`, and an integer `n`. The tuple is a collection of elements, and `m` and `n` are indices and values to be appended to the tuple.

The function first makes a deep copy of the input tuple `tuplex`. This is done to ensure that the original tuple is not modified when we modify the copy.

Then, it appends the integer `n` to the list at index `m` of the copied tuple. The `append` method is used to add `n` to the list at index `m`.

Finally, the function returns the modified tuple.

Let's apply this function to the input `("HELLO", 5, [], True)`, `2`, and `50`.

The tuple has four elements: "HELLO", 5, an empty list [], and True. The index `m` is 2, which corresponds to the empty list []. The integer `n` is 50.

So, the function will append 50 to the list at index 2 of the copied tuple. The modified tuple will be `("HELLO", 5, [50], True)`.

So, the output of the function `colon_tuplex(("HELLO", 5, [], True) ,2,50)` will be `("HELLO", 5, [50], True)`.

<<<Output>>>
`("HELLO", 5, [50], True)`
