### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import re
def occurance_substring(text,pattern):
 for match in re.finditer(pattern, text):
    s = match.start()
    e = match.end()
    return (text[s:e], s, e)
<Code>

What would be the return value of`occurance_substring('python programming, python language','python')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `occurance_substring` takes two parameters: `text` and `pattern`. The `text` parameter is the string in which we are searching for the `pattern`. The `pattern` is the substring we are looking for in the `text`.

The function uses the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions in Python. The `re.finditer` function returns an iterator yielding match objects for all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found.

The function then iterates over each match in the `text` using a for loop. For each match, it gets the start and end indices of the match using the `match.start()` and `match.end()` methods respectively. It then returns a tuple containing the substring of `text` that matches the `pattern`, the start index of the match, and the end index of the match.

In the given example, the `text` is 'python programming, python language' and the `pattern` is 'python'. The function will return the first occurrence of 'python' in the text, which is 'python', the start index of 'python' in the text which is 0, and the end index of 'python' in the text which is 5.

So, the output of the function `occurance_substring('python programming, python language','python')` would be `('python', 0, 5)`.

<<<Output>>>
('python', 0, 5)
