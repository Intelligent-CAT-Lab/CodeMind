### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def first_non_repeating_character(str1):
  char_order = []
  ctr = {}
  for c in str1:
    if c in ctr:
      ctr[c] += 1
    else:
      ctr[c] = 1 
      char_order.append(c)
  for c in char_order:
    if ctr[c] == 1:
      return c
  return None
<Code>

What would be the return value of`first_non_repeating_character("abcabc")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `first_non_repeating_character` takes a string `str1` as input.

Two empty lists `char_order` and `ctr` are initialized. `char_order` will be used to keep track of the order of characters in `str1`, and `ctr` will be used to count the occurrence of each character in `str1`.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character `c` in `str1`. For each character, it checks if `c` is already in `ctr`. If `c` is in `ctr`, it increments the count of `c` by 1. If `c` is not in `ctr`, it adds `c` to `ctr` with a count of 1 and appends `c` to `char_order`.

After the loop, the code enters another loop that iterates over each character `c` in `char_order`. For each character, it checks if the count of `c` in `ctr` is 1. If the count is 1, it returns `c` as the first non-repeating character. If no such character is found after the second loop, it returns `None`.

In the given example, the string "abcabc" has no repeating characters, so the function returns `None`.

<<<Output>>>
None
