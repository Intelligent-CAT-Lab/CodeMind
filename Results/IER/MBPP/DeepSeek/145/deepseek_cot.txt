### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_Abs_Diff(arr): 
    n = len(arr)
    minEle = arr[0] 
    maxEle = arr[0] 
    for i in range(1, n): 
        minEle = min(minEle,arr[i]) 
        maxEle = max(maxEle,arr[i]) 
    return (maxEle - minEle) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of`max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3))`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_Abs_Diff(arr)` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in the list.

The variable `n` is initialized to the length of the input list `arr`.

The variables `minEle` and `maxEle` are initialized to the first element of the list `arr`. These variables will be used to keep track of the minimum and maximum elements in the list.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n` (exclusive), meaning it will consider elements from the second to the last element of the list.

For each element `arr[i]` in this range, it updates `minEle` to be the minimum of `minEle` and `arr[i]`, and `maxEle` to be the maximum of `maxEle` and `arr[i]`. This is done using Python's built-in `min()` and `max()` functions.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the difference between `maxEle` and `minEle`. This is the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in the list.

For the input `(2,1,5,3)`, the minimum element is 1 and the maximum element is 5. So, the function returns `(5 - 1) = 4`.

<<<Output>>>
4
