### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def insert_element(list,element):
 list = [v for elt in list for v in (element, elt)]
 return list
<Code>

What would be the return value of`insert_element(['Red', 'Green', 'Black'] ,'c')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `insert_element` takes a list and an element as input. It returns a new list where the element is inserted between each pair of elements in the original list.

The original list is ['Red', 'Green', 'Black']. The element to be inserted is 'c'.

The function creates a new list by iterating over each element in the original list. For each element, it creates a pair of the element and the inserted element, and adds these pairs to the new list.

So, for the first element 'Red', the pair is ('c', 'Red'). For the second element 'Green', the pair is ('Green', 'c'). For the third element 'Black', the pair is ('Black', 'c').

The new list is then ['c', 'Red', 'c', 'Green', 'c', 'Black'].

The function then returns this new list.

<<<Output>>>
['c', 'Red', 'c', 'Green', 'c', 'Black']
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

This is the output of the code execution.
