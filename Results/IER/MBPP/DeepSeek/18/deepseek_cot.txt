### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
	temp = [] 
	for x in string: 
		temp.append(x) 
	return temp 
def lst_to_string(List): 
	return ''.join(List) 
def get_char_count_array(string): 
	count = [0] * NO_OF_CHARS 
	for i in string: 
		count[ord(i)] += 1
	return count 
def remove_dirty_chars(string, second_string): 
	count = get_char_count_array(second_string) 
	ip_ind = 0
	res_ind = 0
	temp = '' 
	str_list = str_to_list(string) 
	while ip_ind != len(str_list): 
		temp = str_list[ip_ind] 
		if count[ord(temp)] == 0: 
			str_list[res_ind] = str_list[ip_ind] 
			res_ind += 1
		ip_ind+=1
	return lst_to_string(str_list[0:res_ind]) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of`remove_dirty_chars("probasscurve", "pros")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_dirty_chars` takes two strings as input. The first string is the one that we want to remove characters from, and the second string is the reference string that contains the characters we want to keep.

The function first creates a count array of the characters in the second string. The count array is a list where each index corresponds to the ASCII value of a character, and the value at that index is the count of that character in the second string.

Then, the function iterates over the first string. For each character in the first string, it checks the count array to see if the character is in the second string. If it is, it keeps the character and moves on to the next one. If it isn't, it removes the character.

Finally, the function returns the cleaned string.

In the example `remove_dirty_chars("probasscurve", "pros")`, the function will remove the 'b', 'a', and 's' characters from the string "probasscurve", because they are not present in the string "pros". The cleaned string will be "probcurve", which is the output of the function.

<<<Output>>>
"probcurve"
