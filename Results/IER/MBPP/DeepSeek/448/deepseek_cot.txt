### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def cal_sum(n): 
	a = 3
	b = 0
	c = 2
	if (n == 0): 
		return 3
	if (n == 1): 
		return 3
	if (n == 2): 
		return 5
	sum = 5
	while (n > 2): 
		d = a + b 
		sum = sum + d 
		a = b 
		b = c 
		c = d 
		n = n-1
	return sum
<Code>

What would be the return value of`cal_sum(9)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `cal_sum(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the first `n` numbers in a sequence defined by the following rules:

- The sequence starts with the numbers 3, 3, 5.
- Each subsequent number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers.
- If `n` is 0, 1, or 2, the function returns 3, 3, or 5 respectively.

The variable `a`, `b`, `c` are initialized to 3, 0, 2, respectively.

The variable `sum` is initialized to 5, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the sequence.

Then, if `n` is not 0, 1, or 2, the code enters a loop that continues until `n` is 2 or less. In each iteration of the loop, the code calculates the next number in the sequence by adding `a` and `b`, updates `sum` by adding the new number to `sum`, and then updates `a`, `b`, and `c` to the last two numbers in the sequence and `c` to the new number.

Finally, the function returns the value of `sum`, which is the sum of the first `n` numbers in the sequence.

For `cal_sum(9)`, the function will calculate the sum of the first 9 numbers in the sequence.

<<<Output>>>
The output of `cal_sum(9)` will be 112.
