The function `even_Power_Sum(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the fifth power of all even numbers from 1 to `n`.

The variable `sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to `n`.

For each number `i` in this range, it calculates the fifth power of 2*i and adds it to `sum`. The result of `j*j*j*j*j` is the fifth power of 2*i.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `sum`, which is the sum of the fifth power of all even numbers from 1 to `n`.

For example, if `n` is 2, the function will calculate the fifth power of 2, 4, and 6 (which are the even numbers from 1 to 2) and return their sum.

So, `even_Power_Sum(2)` will return 40000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
