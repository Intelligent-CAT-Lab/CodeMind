### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def check_value(dict, n):
    result = all(x == n for x in dict.values()) 
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of`check_value({'Cierra Vega': 12, 'Alden Cantrell': 12, 'Kierra Gentry': 12, 'Pierre Cox': 12},10)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_value` takes a dictionary and a number n as input. The dictionary contains names as keys and numbers as values. The function checks if all the values in the dictionary are equal to the number n.

In the given example, the dictionary is `{'Cierra Vega': 12, 'Alden Cantrell': 12, 'Kierra Gentry': 12, 'Pierre Cox': 12}` and the number n is 10.

The function `all()` is used with a generator expression that checks if all the values in the dictionary are equal to n. The `==` operator is used to compare each value in the dictionary with n. If all values are equal to n, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

So, the function `check_value` will return `False` because not all values in the dictionary are equal to 10.

<<<Output>>>
False
