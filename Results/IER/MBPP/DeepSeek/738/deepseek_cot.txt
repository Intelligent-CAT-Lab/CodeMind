### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def geometric_sum(n):
  if n < 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return 1 / (pow(2, n)) + geometric_sum(n - 1)
<Code>

What would be the return value of`geometric_sum(7)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `geometric_sum` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the geometric series. The geometric series is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the ratio. In this case, the ratio is 2.

The base of the geometric series is 1 and the ratio is 2. The series is defined as: 1, 2, 4, 8, ...

The function uses recursion to calculate the sum of the geometric series. The base case of the recursion is when `n` is less than 0, in which case the function returns 0.

For each recursive call, the function calculates the next term of the series by dividing 1 by 2 to the power of `n` and adds this to the result of the recursive call with `n` decremented by 1.

The function is called with the argument 7, which means it will calculate the sum of the first 7 terms of the geometric series.

The sum of the first 7 terms of the geometric series is approximately 0.125.

<<<Output>>>
0.125

Note: The actual output may vary slightly due to the precision of floating point arithmetic.
