### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    count = 0
    for item in tup: 
        if item in lst: 
            count+= 1 
    return count  
<Code>

What would be the return value of`count_Occurrence(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'),['a', 'b'] )`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_Occurrence` takes two inputs: a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`. The tuple `tup` contains elements to be counted, and the list `lst` contains elements to be searched in the tuple.

The function iterates over each item in the tuple `tup`. For each item, it checks if the item is in the list `lst`. If the item is in the list, it increments the count by 1.

Finally, the function returns the count, which represents the number of occurrences of elements in the tuple `tup` that are also in the list `lst`.

In the given example, the function is called with the tuple `('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd')` and the list `['a', 'b']`.

The count starts at 0. For each item in the tuple, if the item is in the list, the count is incremented by 1. The final count is 2, because the items 'a' and 'b' both appear in the list.

So, the output of the function `count_Occurrence(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'),['a', 'b'] )` would be 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
