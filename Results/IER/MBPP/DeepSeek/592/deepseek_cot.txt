### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    C = [0] * (k + 1); 
    C[0] = 1; # nC0 is 1 
    for i in range(1,n + 1):  
        for j in range(min(i, k),0,-1): 
            C[j] = C[j] + C[j - 1]; 
    return C[k]; 
def sum_Of_product(n): 
    return binomial_Coeff(2 * n,n - 1); 
<Code>

What would be the return value of`sum_Of_product(3)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `binomial_Coeff(n, k)` calculates the binomial coefficient `nCk`. It does this by first initializing a list `C` of size `k + 1` with all elements set to 0, and then setting the first element of `C` to 1.

The outer loop in `binomial_Coeff(n, k)` runs from 1 to `n + 1`. For each `i`, the inner loop runs from the minimum of `i` and `k` down to 1. For each `j` in this range, `C[j]` is updated by adding `C[j]` and `C[j - 1]`.

The function `sum_Of_product(n)` calculates the sum of products. It does this by calling `binomial_Coeff(2 * n, n - 1)`.

When `sum_Of_product(3)` is called, it calculates the binomial coefficient of `2 * 3 = 6` and `3 - 1 = 2`, respectively.

The output of `sum_Of_product(3)` is the value of `6C2`, which is 15.

<<<Output>>>
15

Note: The binomial coefficient `nCk` is a mathematical concept that represents the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements. It is denoted as `nCk` and is calculated as `nCk = nCk-1 * (n - k + 1) / k`.

In the given code, `binomial_Coeff(2 * n, n - 1)` is used to calculate the sum of products. This is equivalent to calculating `(2n)C(n-1)`, which is the number of ways to choose `n - 1` elements from a set of `2n` elements.

The output of `sum_Of_product(3)` is 15, which is the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of 6 elements.
