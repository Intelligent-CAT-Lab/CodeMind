### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def multiply_elements(test_tup):
  res = tuple(i * j for i, j in zip(test_tup, test_tup[1:]))
  return (res) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of`multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `multiply_elements` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input. The tuple contains integers. The function will return a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in `test_tup` and the next element in the tuple.

The function uses the `zip` function to pair up the elements of `test_tup` with the next element in the tuple. The `tuple` function is then used to convert the result of the `zip` function into a tuple. The result is a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in `test_tup` and the next element in the tuple.

For example, if `test_tup` is (1, 5, 7, 8, 10), the function will return a tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in `test_tup` and the next element in the tuple. So the output will be (5, 35, 56, 80).

The `zip` function pairs up the elements of `test_tup` with the next element in the tuple, resulting in a sequence of pairs. The `tuple` function then converts this sequence of pairs into a tuple.

The `tuple` function is used with a generator expression that multiplies each pair of elements. The result is a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in `test_tup` and the next element in the tuple.

The function does not modify the original tuple. Instead, it creates a new tuple that contains the products of the elements in `test_tup`.

The function does not check if the input is a tuple. It assumes that the input is always a tuple of integers.

The function does not handle the case where `test_tup` has less than two elements. If `test_tup` has less than two elements, the function will return an empty tuple.
