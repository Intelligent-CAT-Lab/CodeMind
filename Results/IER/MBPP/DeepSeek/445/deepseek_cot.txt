### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def index_multiplication(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
   for tup1, tup2 in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))
  return (res) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of`index_multiplication(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)),((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3)) )`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `index_multiplication` takes two tuples of tuples as input. The first tuple of tuples contains two elements each, and the second tuple of tuples also contains two elements each. The function returns a new tuple of tuples where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in the input tuples.

The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the input tuples in parallel. For each pair of tuples, it uses the `zip` function again to iterate over the elements of the tuples in parallel. For each pair of elements, it multiplies them together and stores the result in a new tuple. This new tuple is then added to the result tuple.

The result is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple contains the products of the corresponding elements in the input tuples.

The input given is `((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)),((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))`.

The output of the function will be a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple contains the products of the corresponding elements in the input tuples.

The calculation is as follows:

- For the first pair of tuples, the product is `(1*6, 3*7)` which is `(6, 21)`.
- For the second pair of tuples, the product is `(4*3, 5*9)` which is `(12, 45)`.
- For the third pair of tuples, the product is `(2*1, 9*1)` which is `(2, 9)`.
- For the fourth pair of tuples, the product is `(1*7, 10*3)` which is `(7, 30)`.

So, the output of the function will be `((6, 21), (12, 45), (2, 9), (7, 30))`.

<<<Output>>>
((6, 21), (12, 45), (2, 9), (7, 30))
