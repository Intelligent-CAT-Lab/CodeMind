### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def tuple_to_int(nums):
    result = int(''.join(map(str,nums)))
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of`tuple_to_int((1,2,3))`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `tuple_to_int` takes a tuple `nums` as input. The tuple contains integers. The function converts each integer in the tuple to a string, joins them together, and then converts the resulting string to an integer.

The `map` function applies the `str` function to each element in `nums`, converting each integer to a string. The `join` function then concatenates all the strings in the list into a single string. Finally, the `int` function converts this string to an integer.

The output of the function is the integer formed by concatenating the strings of the input integers.

For example, if the input is `(1,2,3)`, the function first converts the integers to strings: `['1', '2', '3']`. It then joins these strings into a single string: `'123'`. Finally, it converts this string to an integer, resulting in the output `123`.

So, the return value of `tuple_to_int((1,2,3))` would be `123`.

<<<Output>>>
123
