### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def intersection_array(array_nums1,array_nums2):
 result = list(filter(lambda x: x in array_nums1, array_nums2)) 
 return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of`intersection_array([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10],[1, 2, 4, 8, 9])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `intersection_array` takes two arrays as input, `array_nums1` and `array_nums2`.

The function uses the `filter` function to create a new list that includes only the elements that are present in both `array_nums1` and `array_nums2`. The `filter` function takes a function and a list as arguments, and returns a new list that includes only the elements for which the function returns `True`.

The lambda function `lambda x: x in array_nums1` is used as the function argument. This function takes an element `x` from `array_nums2` and checks if `x` is in `array_nums1`. If `x` is in `array_nums1`, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

The `filter` function then returns a new list that includes only the elements from `array_nums2` that are in `array_nums1`.

Finally, the function returns this new list as the result.

Given the input `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10],[1, 2, 4, 8, 9]`, the function will return a new list that includes only the elements that are present in both lists.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the function `intersection_array([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10],[1, 2, 4, 8, 9])` will be `[1, 2, 8, 9]`.
