### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_sum(arr): 
	MSIBS = arr[:] 
	for i in range(len(arr)): 
		for j in range(0, i): 
			if arr[i] > arr[j] and MSIBS[i] < MSIBS[j] + arr[i]: 
				MSIBS[i] = MSIBS[j] + arr[i] 
	MSDBS = arr[:] 
	for i in range(1, len(arr) + 1): 
		for j in range(1, i): 
			if arr[-i] > arr[-j] and MSDBS[-i] < MSDBS[-j] + arr[-i]: 
				MSDBS[-i] = MSDBS[-j] + arr[-i] 
	max_sum = float("-Inf") 
	for i, j, k in zip(MSIBS, MSDBS, arr): 
		max_sum = max(max_sum, i + j - k) 
	return max_sum
<Code>

What would be the return value of`max_sum([1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_sum` takes a list `arr` as input and returns the maximum sum of subsequences that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the array.

The function first initializes two lists `MSIBS` and `MSDBS` with the same length as `arr`. `MSIBS` will be used to store the maximum sum of increasing subsequences ending at each index, and `MSDBS` will be used to store the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences ending at each index.

The function then enters two nested loops. The first loop iterates over `arr` and for each element `arr[i]`, it checks all previous elements `arr[j]` where `j < i`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` and `MSIBS[i]` is less than `MSIBS[j] + arr[i]`, it updates `MSIBS[i]` to `MSIBS[j] + arr[i]`. This is done to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequences ending at each index.

The second loop does the same but for the elements in reverse order. It checks all previous elements `arr[-j]` where `-j > -i` and updates `MSDBS[-i]` accordingly. This is done to find the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences ending at each index.

Finally, the function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and iterates over `MSIBS`, `MSDBS`, and `arr` simultaneously. For each triplet `(i, j, k)`, it calculates `i + j - k` and updates `max_sum` if the calculated value is greater than the current `max_sum`. This is done to find the maximum sum of subsequences that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the array.

The function then returns `max_sum`.

Given the input `[1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]`, the function will return the maximum sum of subsequences that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the array.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the function `max_sum([1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9])` is 263.
