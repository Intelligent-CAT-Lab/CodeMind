The output of the code will be the surface area of the cylinder.

Let's calculate it:

surfacearea = ((2*3.1415*10*10) +(2*3.1415*10*5))

surfacearea = 628.32 + 314.15

surfacearea = 942.47

So, the surface area of the cylinder with a radius of 10 units and a height of 5 units is 942.47 square units.
