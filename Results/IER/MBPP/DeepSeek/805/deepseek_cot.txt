### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_sum_list(lists):
 return max(lists, key=sum)
<Code>

What would be the return value of`max_sum_list([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [10,11,12], [7,8,9]])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_sum_list(lists)` takes a list of lists as input. The function is supposed to return the list from the input list of lists that has the maximum sum of its elements.

The `max()` function is a built-in Python function that returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments. The `key` parameter of the `max()` function specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the list.

In this case, the `key` parameter is set to `sum`, which means that the `max()` function will use the sum of the elements in each list as the comparison key. The list with the largest sum will be returned by the function.

The input `[[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [10,11,12], [7,8,9]]` is a list of lists. Each inner list represents a set of numbers. The function will return the list that has the largest sum of its elements.

The sum of the elements in each list is calculated as follows:
- For the first list [1,2,3], the sum is 1+2+3 = 6.
- For the second list [4,5,6], the sum is 4+5+6 = 15.
- For the third list [10,11,12], the sum is 10+11+12 = 33.
- For the fourth list [7,8,9], the sum is 7+8+9 = 24.

The list with the largest sum is [10,11,12] with a sum of 33.

So, the output of `max_sum_list([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [10,11,12], [7,8,9]])` will be `[10,11,12]`.

<<<Output>>>
[10,11,12]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

```python
def max_sum_list(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)

print(max_sum_list([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [10,11,12], [7,8,9]]))
```

This will output: `[10,11,12]`
