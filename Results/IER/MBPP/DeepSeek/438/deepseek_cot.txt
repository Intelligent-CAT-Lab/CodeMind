### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def count_bidirectional(test_list):
  res = 0
  for idx in range(0, len(test_list)):
    for iidx in range(idx + 1, len(test_list)):
      if test_list[iidx][0] == test_list[idx][1] and test_list[idx][1] == test_list[iidx][0]:
        res += 1
  return res
<Code>

What would be the return value of`count_bidirectional([(5, 6), (1, 2), (6, 5), (9, 1), (6, 5), (2, 1)] )`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_bidirectional` takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains two elements. The function is counting the number of pairs in the list where the second element of one pair is the first element of the next pair and vice versa.

The variable `res` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of pairs meeting the condition.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the list. For each index `idx`, it enters another loop that iterates over the indices of the list starting from `idx + 1`.

Inside this inner loop, the code checks if the second element of the pair at index `iidx` is equal to the first element of the pair at index `idx` and if the first element of the pair at index `idx` is equal to the second element of the pair at index `iidx`. If both conditions are met, it increments `res` by 1.

After the inner loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `res`, which is the count of pairs meeting the condition.

For the input `[(5, 6), (1, 2), (6, 5), (9, 1), (6, 5), (2, 1)]`, the pairs meeting the condition are `(6, 5)` and `(5, 6)`, so the output of the code would be 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
