### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def square_nums(nums):
 square_nums = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, nums))
 return square_nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of`square_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `square_nums` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input.
The function uses the `map` function to apply a lambda function to each element in `nums`. The lambda function squares each element (`x: x ** 2`).
The result is a new list `square_nums` where each element is the square of the corresponding element in `nums`.
Finally, the function returns `square_nums`.

In the given example, `square_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])`, the lambda function squares each number in the list.

So, the analysis is:
1. The function `square_nums` is defined with one parameter `nums`.
2. The `map` function is used to apply a lambda function to each element in `nums`.
3. The lambda function squares each element (`x: x ** 2`).
4. The result is a new list `square_nums` where each element is the square of the corresponding element in `nums`.
5. The function returns `square_nums`.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
