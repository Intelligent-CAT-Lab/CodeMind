### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import re

def find_literals(text, pattern):
  match = re.search(pattern, text)
  s = match.start()
  e = match.end()
  return (match.re.pattern, s, e)
<Code>

What would be the return value of`find_literals('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.', 'fox')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_literals` takes two parameters: `text` and `pattern`. The `text` parameter is the string in which the function will search for the `pattern`. The `pattern` is the regular expression that the function will use to search for matches in the `text`.

The function uses the `re.search` method from Python's `re` module to search for the `pattern` in the `text`. The `re.search` method returns a match object if the `pattern` is found in the `text`, otherwise it returns `None`.

The `match.start()` method returns the starting index of the matched substring in the `text`. The `match.end()` method returns the ending index of the matched substring in the `text`.

The function returns a tuple containing the `pattern`, the starting index of the match in the `text`, and the ending index of the match in the `text`.

In the example given, the `text` is 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.' and the `pattern` is 'fox'. The function will return the pattern, the starting index of the match in the text, and the ending index of the match in the text.

The `re.search` method will find the first occurrence of the `pattern` in the `text`, so the starting index of the match will be 16 and the ending index of the match will be 20.

So, the output of the function `find_literals('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.', 'fox')` will be ('fox', 16, 20).

<<<Output>>>
('fox', 16, 20)
