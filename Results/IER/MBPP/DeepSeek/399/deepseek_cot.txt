### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def bitwise_xor(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(ele1 ^ ele2 for ele1, ele2 in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))
  return (res) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of`bitwise_xor((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `bitwise_xor` takes two tuples as input, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. It uses the built-in `zip` function to pair up corresponding elements from `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. For each pair of elements, it applies the bitwise XOR operation (`^`) and stores the result in a new tuple `res`.

The bitwise XOR operation is a binary operation that takes two equal-length binary representations (here, each element in the tuples is represented as a binary number), and performs the logical XOR operation on both pairs of the two binary digits, which are 0 and 1. The result of the XOR operation is 1 if the two bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.

In the given example, `bitwise_xor((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`, the pairs are (10, 5), (4, 2), (6, 3), and (9, 3). The XOR operation is performed on each pair, resulting in the tuple (15, 6, 5, 0).

So, the output of the function `bitwise_xor` for the given input would be `(15, 6, 5, 0)`.
<<<Output>>>
(15, 6, 5, 0)
