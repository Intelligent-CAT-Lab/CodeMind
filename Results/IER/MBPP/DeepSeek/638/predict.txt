The function `wind_chill(v, t)` takes two inputs: `v` and `t`. `v` represents the wind speed in miles per hour and `t` represents the temperature in Fahrenheit.

The formula used to calculate the wind chill index is:

`windchill = 13.12 + 0.6215*t - 11.37*v^0.16 + 0.3965*t*v^0.16`

Here, `^` denotes the power operation.

The function first calculates the wind chill index using the given formula. Then it rounds the result to the nearest integer and returns it.

Given the inputs `v = 120` and `t = 35`, the function first calculates the wind chill index using the given formula. Then it rounds the result to the nearest integer and returns it.

The wind chill index is calculated based on the wind speed and temperature. The higher the wind speed and the colder the temperature, the higher the wind chill index.

The wind chill index is a measure of how cold it feels outside, based on the wind speed and temperature. It's commonly used in meteorology and is used in weather forecasting.
