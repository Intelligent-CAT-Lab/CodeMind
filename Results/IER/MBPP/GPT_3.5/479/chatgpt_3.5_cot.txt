<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 123.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than or equal to 10.
Inside the loop, n is divided by 10, effectively removing the last digit of n.
This process continues until n becomes less than 10.
Finally, the code returns the integer value of n.
In this case, the loop will run twice, dividing n by 10 two times, resulting in n becoming 1.23.
The return statement then converts this value to an integer, returning 1.
