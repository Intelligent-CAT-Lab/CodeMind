<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `find_kth` that takes three arguments: `arr1`, `arr2`, and `k`.
It initializes variables `m` and `n` to the lengths of `arr1` and `arr2` respectively.
It creates a new list called `sorted1` with a length of `m + n` and initializes all elements to 0.
It also initializes variables `i`, `j`, and `d` to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than `m` and `j` is less than `n`.
Inside the loop, it compares the elements at indices `i` and `j` in `arr1` and `arr2` respectively.
If the element at `arr1[i]` is less than the element at `arr2[j]`, it assigns `arr1[i]` to `sorted1[d]` and increments `i` by 1.
Otherwise, it assigns `arr2[j]` to `sorted1[d]` and increments `j` by 1.
After each assignment, it increments `d` by 1.
This process continues until either `i` reaches `m` or `j` reaches `n`.
Once the loop ends, it enters two more while loops to handle the remaining elements in `arr1` and `arr2` if any.
These loops simply assign the remaining elements to `sorted1` and increment `d` and the respective index variables.
Finally, it returns the element at index `k - 1` in `sorted1`.
In this case, `find_kth([2, 3, 6, 7, 9], [1, 4, 8, 10], 5)` will return the 5th smallest element in the merged and sorted list of `[2, 3, 6, 7, 9]` and `[1, 4, 8, 10]`, which is 6.
