<<<Analysis>>>
The function `last` takes two arguments: `arr` and `x`.
The variable `n` is initialized to the length of `arr`, which is 3 in this case.
The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to 0 and `n-1` respectively, which are 0 and 2 in this case.
The variable `res` is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr`.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index `mid` as the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.
If the value at `arr[mid]` is greater than `x`, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
If the value at `arr[mid]` is less than `x`, it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
If the value at `arr[mid]` is equal to `x`, it updates `res` to `mid` and updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
This process continues until `low` becomes greater than `high`.
Finally, the function returns the value of `res`, which is the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr` or -1 if `x` is not found.
In this case, the value of `res` will be 0, as the last occurrence of 1 in [1,2,3] is at index 0.
