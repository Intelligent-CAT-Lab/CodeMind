<<<Analysis>>>
The function `opposite_Signs` takes two parameters `x` and `y`.
The function returns True if `x` and `y` have opposite signs, and False otherwise.
To determine if two numbers have opposite signs, we can use the bitwise XOR operator (^) on the two numbers and check if the result is negative.
In this case, `x` is 1 and `y` is -2.
The bitwise XOR of 1 and -2 is -3, which is negative.
Therefore, the return value of `opposite_Signs(1,-2)` is True.
<<<Output>>>
True
