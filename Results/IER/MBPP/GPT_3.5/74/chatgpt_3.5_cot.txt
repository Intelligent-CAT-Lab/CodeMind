<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_samepatterns` takes two lists as input: `colors` and `patterns`.
First, it checks if the lengths of `colors` and `patterns` are equal. If they are not, it returns False.
Then, it initializes an empty dictionary `sdict`, a set `pset`, and a set `sset`.
Next, it iterates over the indices of `patterns` using a for loop.
Inside the loop, it adds the current pattern `patterns[i]` to `pset` and the current color `colors[i]` to `sset`.
If the current pattern is not already a key in `sdict`, it adds it as a key with an empty list as its value.
Then, it appends the current color to the list of colors associated with the current pattern in `sdict`.
After the loop, it checks if the lengths of `pset` and `sset` are equal. If they are not, it returns False.
Then, it iterates over the values in `sdict` using another for loop.
Inside this loop, it iterates over the indices of the values using a nested for loop.
If the current value is not equal to the next value in the list, it returns False.
If the function reaches this point without returning False, it returns True.
