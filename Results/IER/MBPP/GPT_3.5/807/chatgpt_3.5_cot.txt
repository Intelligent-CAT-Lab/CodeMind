<<<Analysis>>>
The function `first_odd` takes a list of numbers as input.
It uses a generator expression `(el for el in nums if el%2!=0)` to iterate over the elements of the list and return the first element that is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2).
If no odd element is found, it returns -1.
In this case, the input list is [1,3,5], and all the elements are odd.
Therefore, the first odd element is 1.
