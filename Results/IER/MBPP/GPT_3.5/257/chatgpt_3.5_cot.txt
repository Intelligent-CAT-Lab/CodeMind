<<<Analysis>>>
The function `swap_numbers` takes two arguments `a` and `b`.
Inside the function, the value of `a` is stored in a temporary variable `temp`.
Then, the value of `b` is assigned to `a`.
Finally, the value of `temp` (which is the original value of `a`) is assigned to `b`.
The function returns a tuple containing the new values of `a` and `b`.

In this case, the function is called with arguments `10` and `20`.
So, the value of `a` is initially `10` and the value of `b` is initially `20`.
After swapping the values, the new value of `a` is `20` and the new value of `b` is `10`.
The function returns the tuple `(20, 10)`.

<<<Output>>>
(20, 10)
