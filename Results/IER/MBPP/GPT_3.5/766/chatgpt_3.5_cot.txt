<<<Analysis>>>
The function `pair_wise` takes a list `l1` as input.
It initializes an empty list `temp` to store the pairs of elements.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of `l1` minus 1.
For each iteration, it assigns the current element `current_element` to the element at index `i` in `l1`, and assigns the next element `next_element` to the element at index `i + 1` in `l1`.
It creates a tuple `x` with `current_element` and `next_element`, and appends `x` to the `temp` list.
After the loop finishes, it returns the `temp` list containing all the pairs of elements.
In this case, the input list is [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,5].
The pairs of elements are [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)].
<<<Output>>>
[(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)]
