<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `mul_even_odd` that takes a list as input.
The function uses the `next` function to find the first even number in the list. If no even number is found, it returns -1.
Similarly, it uses the `next` function to find the first odd number in the list. If no odd number is found, it returns -1.
Finally, it returns the product of the first even number and the first odd number.
In this case, the input list is [1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8].
The first even number in the list is 4 and the first odd number is 1.
So, the return value of `mul_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])` would be 4*1 = 4.
