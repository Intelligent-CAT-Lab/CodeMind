<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called max_val that takes a list as input.
Inside the function, it uses a generator expression to iterate over the elements of the list and filter out only the integers.
Then, it uses the max() function to find the maximum value among the filtered integers.
Finally, it returns the maximum value.
In this case, the input list is ['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'].
The generator expression filters out the integers 3, 2, 4, and 5.
The max() function then finds the maximum value among these integers, which is 5.
Therefore, the return value of max_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) is 5.
