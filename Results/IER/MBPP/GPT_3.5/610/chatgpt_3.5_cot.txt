<<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_kth_element` takes two arguments: `list1` and `L`.
It returns a new list that is obtained by removing the element at index `L-1` from `list1`.
In this case, the input `list1` is [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1] and `L` is 3.
The code removes the element at index 2 (since `L-1` is 2) from `list1` and returns the modified list.
The element at index 2 in `list1` is 2, so the modified list will be [1,1,3,4,4,5,1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]
