<<<Analysis>>>
The function `drop_empty` takes a dictionary `dict1` as input.
Inside the function, a new dictionary `dict1` is created using dictionary comprehension.
The comprehension iterates over the items of `dict1` and filters out the items where the value is `None`.
The filtered items are then used to create a new dictionary.
Finally, the new dictionary is returned as the output.
In this case, the input dictionary is `{'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green', 'c3':None}`.
The value of the key `'c3'` is `None`, so it will be filtered out in the new dictionary.
The output will be `{'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}`.
<<<Output>>>
{'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}
