<<<Analysis>>>
The function max_product_tuple takes a list of tuples as input.
The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each tuple in the input list.
For each tuple, it calculates the product of the absolute values of its elements and stores it in a list.
The max() function is then used to find the maximum value in this list.
Finally, the maximum value is returned as the output.
In this case, the input list is [(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)].
The code calculates the products as [14, 12, 8, 36].
The maximum value in this list is 36.
Therefore, the return value of max_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)]) is 36.
