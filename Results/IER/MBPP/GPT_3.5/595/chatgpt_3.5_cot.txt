<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two strings, str1 and str2, as input.
It initializes a variable count to 0, which will be used to count the number of differences between the two strings.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character of str1.
For each character, it checks if it is different from the corresponding character in str2. If it is, it increments the count by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the count is divisible by 2. If it is, it returns the count divided by 2. Otherwise, it returns the string "Not Possible".
In this case, the count is 2, which is divisible by 2. So the code returns 1.
