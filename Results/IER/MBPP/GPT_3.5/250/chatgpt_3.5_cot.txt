<<<Analysis>>>
The variable tup is initialized to the tuple (10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), and the variable x is initialized to 4.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the occurrences of x in the tuple.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element ele in the tuple.
For each element ele, it checks if ele is equal to x. If it is, it increments the count by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of count, which is 0 because there are no occurrences of 4 in the tuple.
<<<Output>>>
0
