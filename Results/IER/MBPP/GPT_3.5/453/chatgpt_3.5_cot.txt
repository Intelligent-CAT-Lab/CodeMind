<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 18.
The code first checks if n is odd. If it is, it returns 0.
The code then initializes the variable res to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of the sums of factors.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive). For each number i in this range, it checks if i is a factor of n.
If i is a factor, it counts the number of times i divides n and stores it in the variable count.
It then calculates the sum of the terms in the geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio i, and stores it in the variable curr_sum.
If i is 2 and count is 1, it sets curr_sum to 0.
It then calculates the product of the terms in the geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio i, and stores it in the variable curr_term.
It adds curr_term to curr_sum.
The code multiplies res by curr_sum.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if n is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it multiplies res by (1 + n).
Finally, it returns the value of res, which is the product of the sums of factors.
