<<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_string` takes two arguments: `str`, which is a list of strings, and `l`, which is an integer.
The code initializes an empty list called `result`.
Then, it enters a list comprehension loop that iterates over each element `e` in `str`.
For each element, it checks if the length of `e` is equal to `l`.
If it is, it appends `e` to the `result` list.
Finally, it returns the `result` list.
In this case, the input `['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution']` has elements with lengths 6, 4, 9, 8, and 8.
The code checks if each element has a length of 8, and only the last two elements ('practice' and 'solution') satisfy this condition.
Therefore, the return value of `extract_string(['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution'] ,8)` will be `['practice', 'solution']`.
<<<Output>>>
['practice', 'solution']
