<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `two_unique_nums` that takes a list of numbers as input.
Inside the function, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `i` in the input list `nums`.
For each element `i`, it checks if the count of `i` in the list `nums` is equal to 1. If it is, it means that `i` is unique in the list.
The list comprehension then returns a new list containing only the unique elements.
In this case, the input list is [1,2,3,2,3,4,5]. The unique elements in this list are 1, 4, and 5.
Therefore, the return value of `two_unique_nums([1,2,3,2,3,4,5])` would be [1, 4, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 5]
