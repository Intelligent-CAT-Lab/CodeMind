<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input parameters: r, g, and b, which represent the red, green, and blue values of a color in the RGB color model.
The code first normalizes the values of r, g, and b by dividing them by 255.0, which scales them to the range [0, 1].
Next, it calculates the maximum (mx) and minimum (mn) values among r, g, and b.
Then, it calculates the difference between mx and mn and stores it in the variable df.
The code then checks several conditions to determine the value of h, which represents the hue in the HSV color model.
If mx is equal to mn, it means that all three RGB values are equal, so the hue is set to 0.
If mx is equal to r, it means that red is the dominant color, so the hue is calculated using the formula (60 * ((g-b)/df) + 360) % 360.
If mx is equal to g, it means that green is the dominant color, so the hue is calculated using the formula (60 * ((b-r)/df) + 120) % 360.
If mx is equal to b, it means that blue is the dominant color, so the hue is calculated using the formula (60 * ((r-g)/df) + 240) % 360.
Next, the code calculates the saturation (s) by dividing df by mx and multiplying by 100. If mx is 0, it means that the color is black, so the saturation is set to 0.
Finally, the code calculates the value (v) by multiplying mx by 100.
The code returns the values of h, s, and v as a tuple.
<<<Output>>>
(0, 0.0, 100.0)
