<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an array `arr` and its length `n` as input.
It initializes a variable `j` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the position of the first positive number in the array.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider each element in the array.
For each element `arr[i]`, it checks if it is negative. If it is, it swaps it with the element at position `j` and increments `j` by 1.
This effectively moves all the negative numbers to the left side of the array and all the positive numbers to the right side.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the modified array `arr`.
In this case, the input array is [-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9] and its length is 9.
The code swaps -1 with itself, 2 with -1, -3 with 2, -7 with -3, and leaves the rest of the array unchanged.
The modified array is [-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9].
<<<Output>>>
[-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9]
