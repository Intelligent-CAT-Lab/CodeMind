<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_list is initialized to [(5, 3, 2, 1, 4), (3, 4, 9, 2, 1),(9, 1, 2, 3, 5), (4, 8, 2, 1, 7)] and variable K is initialized to 2.
The code then initializes an empty list called res, which will store the trimmed tuples.
The code enters a loop that iterates over each element ele in test_list.
For each element ele, it calculates the length of ele and stores it in variable N.
It then appends a tuple to res, which is created by converting ele to a list, slicing it from index K to N-K, and then converting it back to a tuple.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the string representation of res.
<<<Output>>>
'[(2, 1), (9, 2), (2, 3), (2, 1)]'
