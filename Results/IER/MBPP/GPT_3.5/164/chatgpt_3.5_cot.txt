The code defines two functions: div_sum and are_equivalent.
The div_sum function takes an integer n as input and calculates the sum of all the divisors of n.
It initializes a variable total to 1 and a variable i to 2.
Then it enters a while loop that continues as long as i*i is less than or equal to n.
Inside the loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i and the floor division of n by i to the total.
After that, it increments i by 1.
Once the loop finishes, the function returns the value of total.

The are_equivalent function takes two integers num1 and num2 as input and checks if the sum of divisors of num1 is equal to the sum of divisors of num2.
It calls the div_sum function for both num1 and num2 and compares the return values.
If they are equal, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

In this case, the function call are_equivalent(36, 57) will call the div_sum function for both 36 and 57.
The div_sum function for 36 will calculate the sum of divisors as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 + 36 = 91.
The div_sum function for 57 will calculate the sum of divisors as 1 + 3 + 19 + 57 = 80.
Since 91 is not equal to 80, the function will return False.
