<<<Analysis>>>
The function `digit_distance_nums` takes two arguments, `n1` and `n2`.
The function calculates the absolute difference between `n1` and `n2` using the `abs()` function.
Then, it converts the absolute difference to a string using the `str()` function.
Next, it uses the `map()` function to apply the `int()` function to each character in the string, converting them to integers.
The `map()` function returns an iterator, so the `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of the integers.
Finally, the function returns the sum of the digits.
In this case, the absolute difference between 1 and 2 is 1, and the sum of the digits in 1 is 1.
