<<<Analysis>>>
The function `cummulative_sum` takes a list of tuples as input.
The code initializes a variable `res` to 0.
It then uses the `map` function to apply the `sum` function to each tuple in the input list.
The `map` function returns an iterator, so the `sum` function is applied to each tuple and the result is a list of sums.
Finally, the `sum` function is applied to this list of sums, and the result is stored in `res`.
The function then returns the value of `res`.
In this case, the input list is [(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)].
The sums of the tuples are [4, 18, 8].
The sum of this list is 30.
Therefore, the return value of `cummulative_sum([(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)])` is 30.
