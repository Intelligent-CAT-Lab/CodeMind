<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the Counter class from the collections module.
The function sort_counter takes a dictionary as input.
It creates a Counter object x using the input dictionary.
The most_common() method of the Counter object returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an element from the Counter object and its count, sorted in descending order.
The code assigns the sorted list to the variable sort_counter.
Finally, the function returns the value of sort_counter.
In this case, the input dictionary is {'Math':81, 'Physics':83, 'Chemistry':87}.
The Counter object x will count the occurrences of each key in the dictionary, resulting in {'Math':1, 'Physics':1, 'Chemistry':1}.
The most_common() method will return a list of tuples in descending order of count, so the output will be [('Math', 1), ('Physics', 1), ('Chemistry', 1)].
<<<Output>>>
[('Math', 1), ('Physics', 1), ('Chemistry', 1)]
