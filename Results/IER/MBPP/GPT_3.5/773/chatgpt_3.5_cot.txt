<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `occurance_substring` that takes two arguments: `text` and `pattern`.
The function uses the `re.finditer()` function to find all occurrences of the `pattern` in the `text`.
For each match found, the function retrieves the start and end indices of the match and stores them in variables `s` and `e`.
The function then returns a tuple containing the matched substring, the start index, and the end index.
In this case, the `text` is "python programming, python language" and the `pattern` is "python".
The code will find the first occurrence of "python" in the `text` and return a tuple containing the substring "python", the start index 0, and the end index 6.
<<<Output>>>
('python', 0, 6)
