<<<Analysis>>>
The function `tuple_to_dict` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input.
The code initializes an empty dictionary `res`.
Then, it uses a generator expression to iterate over the `test_tup` tuple in steps of 2.
For each iteration, it takes two elements from the tuple and creates a key-value pair in the dictionary `res`.
The key is the first element of the pair, and the value is the second element of the pair.
The code continues this process until it has processed all the elements in the tuple.
Finally, it returns the dictionary `res` as the output.
In this case, the input tuple is `(1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)`.
The code will create the following key-value pairs in the dictionary:
- Key: 1, Value: 5
- Key: 7, Value: 10
- Key: 13, Value: 5
So, the output will be `{1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}`.
<<<Output>>>
{1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}
