<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add_nested_tuples` takes two tuples as input: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
It initializes an empty list `res` to store the result.
The code then uses the `zip` function to iterate over corresponding elements of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
For each pair of tuples `tup1` and `tup2`, it uses another `zip` function to iterate over corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`.
For each pair of elements `a` and `b`, it adds them together and creates a new tuple.
This process is repeated for all pairs of tuples in `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, resulting in a nested tuple.
Finally, the nested tuple `res` is returned as the output.
