<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called unique_Element that takes an input parameter arr.
Inside the function, it creates a set s from the input array arr. A set is an unordered collection of unique elements, so any duplicate elements in arr will be removed in s.
The code then checks if the length of s is equal to 1. If it is, it means that all elements in arr are the same, so the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
In this case, the input array is [1, 1, 1]. When this array is converted to a set, it will only contain one element, which is 1. Therefore, the length of the set is 1, and the function will return True.
