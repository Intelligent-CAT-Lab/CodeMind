<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as i*i is less than or equal to n.
Inside the loop, it checks if n is divisible by i and if the quotient is equal to i. If both conditions are true, it means that i is a factor of n and the quotient is also equal to i, which indicates that n is a perfect square. In this case, the code returns True.
If the conditions inside the if statement are not met, the code increments i by 1 and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If the loop finishes without returning True, it means that n is not a perfect square, so the code returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
