<<<Analysis>>>
The function `division_elements` takes two tuples as input: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
It initializes an empty list `res` to store the division results.
Then, it uses the `zip` function to iterate over the corresponding elements of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
For each pair of elements, it performs integer division (`//`) and appends the result to `res`.
Finally, it returns `res` as a tuple.

In this case, the input tuples are `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`.
The corresponding elements are `(10, 5)`, `(4, 2)`, `(6, 3)`, and `(9, 3)`.
The division results are `2`, `2`, `2`, and `3`.
Therefore, the return value of the function is `(2, 2, 2, 3)`.

<<<Output>>>
(2, 2, 2, 3)
