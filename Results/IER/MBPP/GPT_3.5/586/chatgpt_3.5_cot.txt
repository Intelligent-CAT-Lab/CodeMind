The function `split_Arr` takes two parameters: `l` and `n`. `l` is a list and `n` is an integer.
The function returns a new list that is obtained by splitting the original list `l` at index `n` and concatenating the two resulting parts.
In this case, the input list is [12, 10, 5, 6, 52, 36] and the index `n` is 2.
The function splits the list at index 2, resulting in two parts: [5, 6, 52, 36] and [12, 10].
Then, it concatenates these two parts to form the new list: [5, 6, 52, 36, 12, 10].
Therefore, the return value of `split_Arr([12, 10, 5, 6, 52, 36], 2)` is [5, 6, 52, 36, 12, 10].

[5, 6, 52, 36, 12, 10]
