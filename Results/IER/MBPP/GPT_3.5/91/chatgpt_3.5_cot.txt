<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_substring` takes two parameters: `str1` and `sub_str`.
The code checks if `sub_str` is present in any of the strings in `str1`.
If `sub_str` is found in any of the strings, the function returns True.
If `sub_str` is not found in any of the strings, the function returns False.
In this case, the code checks if "ack" is present in any of the strings in the list ["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"].
The substring "ack" is found in the string "black", so the function will return True.
<<<Output>>>
True
