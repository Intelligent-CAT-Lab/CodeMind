<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: even_ele and extract_even.
The even_ele function takes a tuple (test_tuple) and a function (even_fnc) as input.
It initializes an empty tuple called res.
Then, it iterates over each element in the test_tuple.
If the element is itself a tuple, it recursively calls the even_ele function on that tuple and appends the result to the res tuple.
If the element is not a tuple, it checks if it satisfies the condition specified by the even_fnc function.
If it does, it appends the element to the res tuple.
Finally, it returns the res tuple.

The extract_even function takes a tuple (test_tuple) as input.
It calls the even_ele function with the test_tuple and a lambda function that checks if a number is even (x % 2 == 0).
It assigns the result of the even_ele function to a variable called res.
Finally, it returns the res tuple.

In this case, the input to the extract_even function is (4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8).
The even_ele function is called recursively on the nested tuples to extract the even numbers.
The final result is a tuple containing all the even numbers from the input tuple: (4, 6, 2, 4).

<<<Output>>>
(4, 6, 2, 4)
