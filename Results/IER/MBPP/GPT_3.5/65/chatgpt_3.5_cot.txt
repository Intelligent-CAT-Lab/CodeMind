<<<Analysis>>>
The function `recursive_list_sum` takes a list `data_list` as input.
It initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of all elements in the list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in `data_list`.
For each element, it checks if the element is a list. If it is, it recursively calls the `recursive_list_sum` function on that element and adds the returned value to `total`.
If the element is not a list, it simply adds the element to `total`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `total`.

In this case, the input `([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]])` is a list containing integers and nested lists.
The function will first encounter the element 1, which is not a list, so it adds 1 to `total`.
Next, it encounters the element 2, which is also not a list, so it adds 2 to `total`.
Then, it encounters the nested list `[3,4]`. It recursively calls `recursive_list_sum` on this list.
The recursive call will first encounter the element 3, which is not a list, so it adds 3 to `total`.
Next, it encounters the element 4, which is also not a list, so it adds 4 to `total`.
The recursive call returns the value 7, which is added to `total`.
Finally, the function encounters the nested list `[5,6]`. It recursively calls `recursive_list_sum` on this list.
The recursive call will first encounter the element 5, which is not a list, so it adds 5 to `total`.
Next, it encounters the element 6, which is also not a list, so it adds 6 to `total`.
The recursive call returns the value 11, which is added to `total`.
After all elements have been processed, the function returns the final value of `total`, which is 1 + 2 + 7 + 11 = 21.
