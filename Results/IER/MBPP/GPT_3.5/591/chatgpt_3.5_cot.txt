<<<Analysis>>>
The function `swap_List` takes a list as input and performs the following steps:
1. It calculates the size of the input list and stores it in the variable `size`.
2. It assigns the first element of the input list to the variable `temp`.
3. It assigns the last element of the input list to the first element of the list.
4. It assigns the value of `temp` to the last element of the list.
5. It returns the modified list.

In this case, the input list is [12, 35, 9, 56, 24].
The size of the list is 5.
The first element of the list is 12.
The last element of the list is 24.
After swapping the first and last elements, the modified list becomes [24, 35, 9, 56, 12].
Therefore, the return value of `swap_List([12, 35, 9, 56, 24])` is [24, 35, 9, 56, 12].
<<<Output>>>
[24, 35, 9, 56, 12]
