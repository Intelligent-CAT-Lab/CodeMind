<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called check_element that takes two arguments: a list and an element.
Inside the function, it uses a list comprehension to check if all elements in the list are equal to the given element.
The result of this check is stored in the variable check_element.
Finally, the function returns the value of check_element.
In this case, the list is ["green", "orange", "black", "white"] and the element is 'blue'.
The code checks if all elements in the list are equal to 'blue', which is False.
Therefore, the return value of the function is False.
<<<Output>>>
