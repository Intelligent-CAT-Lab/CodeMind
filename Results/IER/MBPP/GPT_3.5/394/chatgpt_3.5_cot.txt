<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `check_distinct` that takes a tuple `test_tup` as input.
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to `True` and a set `temp` is created.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element `ele` in the tuple `test_tup`.
For each element, it checks if it is already present in the set `temp`. If it is, it sets `res` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
If the element is not present in the set, it adds it to the set.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of `res`, which will be `True` if all elements in the tuple are distinct and `False` otherwise.
In this case, the tuple `(1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)` contains duplicate elements (1 and 4), so the function will return `False`.
