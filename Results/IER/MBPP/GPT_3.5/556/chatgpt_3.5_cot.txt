The variable A is initialized to [5,4,7,2,1] and variable N is initialized to 5.
The variable oddPair is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of odd pairs.
The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to N-1, and the inner loop iterates from i+1 to N-1.
For each pair of indices (i, j) where i < j, it checks if the bitwise XOR of A[i] and A[j] is odd. If it is, it increments the oddPair variable by 1.
In this case, the pairs that satisfy the condition are (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 7), (4, 2), (4, 1), (7, 2), (7, 1), (2, 1), for a total of 10 pairs.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of oddPair, which is 10.
