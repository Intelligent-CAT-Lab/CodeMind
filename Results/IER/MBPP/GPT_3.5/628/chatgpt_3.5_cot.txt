<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `replace_spaces` that takes a string as input.
Inside the function, it uses the `replace` method of strings to replace all occurrences of a space (" ") with "%20".
The modified string is then returned as the output of the function.
In this case, the input string is "My Name is Dawood".
The code replaces the spaces in the string with "%20" and returns the modified string as the output.
<<<Output>>>
"My%20Name%20is%20Dawood"
