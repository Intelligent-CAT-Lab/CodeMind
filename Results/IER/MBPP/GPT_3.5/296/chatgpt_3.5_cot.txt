<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `get_Inv_Count` that takes an array `arr` as input.
The variable `inv_count` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of inversions in the array.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all pairs of elements in the array.
For each pair (i, j) where i < j, it checks if arr[i] is greater than arr[j]. If it is, it increments `inv_count` by 1.
This means that for each element in the array, it counts the number of elements that come after it and are smaller than it.
After the nested loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `inv_count`.
In this case, the array [1, 20, 6, 4, 5] has 5 inversions: (20, 6), (20, 4), (20, 5), (6, 4), and (6, 5).
So the return value of `get_Inv_Count([1, 20, 6, 4, 5])` would be 5.
