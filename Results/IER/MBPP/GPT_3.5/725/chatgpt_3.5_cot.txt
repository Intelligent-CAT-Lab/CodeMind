<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `extract_quotation` that takes a string `text1` as input.
Inside the function, it uses the `re.findall()` function from the `re` module to find all occurrences of text enclosed in double quotation marks in `text1`.
The regular expression pattern `r'"(.*?)"'` is used to match any text that is enclosed in double quotation marks.
The `.*?` part of the pattern matches any character (except a newline) zero or more times, but as few times as possible.
The `re.findall()` function returns a list of all matches found in `text1`.
The function then returns this list as the output.
In this case, the input string is `'Cortex "A53" Based "multi" tasking "Processor"'`.
The function will find all occurrences of text enclosed in double quotation marks in this string, which are `"A53"`, `"multi"`, and `"Processor"`.
Therefore, the return value of `extract_quotation('Cortex "A53" Based "multi" tasking "Processor"')` will be `['A53', 'multi', 'Processor']`.
<<<Output>>>
['A53', 'multi', 'Processor']
