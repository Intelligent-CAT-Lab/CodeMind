<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code then calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula S = (n*(n + 1))//2.
In this case, S = (3*(3 + 1))//2 = 6.
The code then calculates the difference between S and 1 and stores it in the variable res.
In this case, res = 6*(6-1) = 30.
Finally, the code returns the value of res, which is 30.
<<<Output>>>
30
