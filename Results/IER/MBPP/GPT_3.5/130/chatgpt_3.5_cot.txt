<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module.
The function `max_occurrences` takes a list of numbers as input.
Inside the function, a `defaultdict` object named `dict` is created, which will store the count of occurrences of each number in the input list.
The code then iterates over each number `i` in the input list and increments the count of `i` in the `dict` object.
After the loop finishes, the code finds the key-value pair with the maximum value in the `dict` object using the `max` function and a lambda function as the key argument. This will return a tuple containing the key and value of the maximum occurrence.
Finally, the code returns the key of the tuple, which represents the number with the maximum occurrences in the input list.
In this case, the number with the maximum occurrences is 2, which appears 5 times in the input list.
