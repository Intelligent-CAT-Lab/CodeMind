<<<Analysis>>>
The input to the function is a list of lists: [[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]].
The code first flattens the list of lists into a single list using a list comprehension. The resulting list is [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 7, 8, 9, 5].
Then, it initializes an empty dictionary called dic_data.
Next, it iterates over each number in the flattened list.
For each number, it checks if the number is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the value associated with that key by 1.
If the number is not a key in the dictionary, it creates a new key-value pair with the number as the key and 1 as the value.
After iterating over all the numbers, the code returns the dictionary dic_data, which contains the frequency of each number in the input list.
<<<Output>>>
{1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}
