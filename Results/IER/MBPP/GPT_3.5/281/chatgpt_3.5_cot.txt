<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `all_unique` that takes a list called `test_list` as input.
The code checks if the length of `test_list` is greater than the length of the set of `test_list`. 
If it is, it means that there are duplicate elements in the list, so the function returns False.
Otherwise, it means that all elements in the list are unique, so the function returns True.
In this case, the input list is [1,2,3], which has no duplicate elements. Therefore, the function will return True.
<<<Output>>>
True
