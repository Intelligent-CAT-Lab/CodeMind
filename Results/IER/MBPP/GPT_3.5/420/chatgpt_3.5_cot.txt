<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the cubes.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the cube of 2*i and adds it to sum.
In the first iteration, i is 1, so the cube of 2*1 is added to sum.
In the second iteration, i is 2, so the cube of 2*2 is added to sum.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum, which is 24.
<<<Output>>>
24
