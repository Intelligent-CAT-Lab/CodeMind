<<<Analysis>>>
The function `rectangle_area` takes two parameters `l` and `b`, which represent the length and breadth of a rectangle, respectively.
Inside the function, it calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying `l` and `b` and stores it in the variable `area`.
Finally, it returns the value of `area`.
In this case, the function is called with arguments `10` and `20`, so the length is `10` and the breadth is `20`.
The area of the rectangle is calculated as `10 * 20 = 200`.
<<<Output>>>
200
