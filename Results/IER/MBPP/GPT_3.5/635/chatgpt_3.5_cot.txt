<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the `heapq` module as `hq`.
The function `heap_sort` takes an iterable as input.
Inside the function, an empty list `h` is created.
The code then iterates over each value in the input iterable and pushes it onto the heap `h` using the `heappush` function from the `hq` module.
After all the values have been pushed onto the heap, the code creates a list comprehension that pops the smallest value from the heap `h` using the `heappop` function and appends it to a new list. This process is repeated for the length of the heap.
Finally, the sorted list is returned.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
