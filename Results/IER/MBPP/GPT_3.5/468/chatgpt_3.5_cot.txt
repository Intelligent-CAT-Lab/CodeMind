<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called max_product that takes an array as input.
It initializes a variable n to the length of the array and creates a copy of the array called mpis.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each iteration, it initializes a variable current_prod to the value of the current element in the array.
It also initializes a variable j to i + 1, which represents the next index in the array.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as j is less than n.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the previous element (arr[j-1]) is greater than the current element (arr[j]).
If it is, it breaks out of the while loop.
Otherwise, it multiplies the current_prod by the current element and checks if the result is greater than the corresponding element in mpis.
If it is, it updates the corresponding element in mpis with the new value.
Finally, it increments j by 1.
After the while loop finishes, the code returns the maximum value in mpis.
In this case, the maximum value in mpis is 150, so the return value of max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) is 150.
<<<Output>>>
150
