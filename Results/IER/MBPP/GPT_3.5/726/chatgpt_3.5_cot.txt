<<<Analysis>>>
The function `multiply_elements` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input.
It initializes an empty list `res` to store the result.
Then it uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `test_tup` and multiply each element with the next element in the tuple.
The result of each multiplication is added to the `res` list.
Finally, the function returns the `res` list as a tuple.

In this case, the input tuple is `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`.
The function will iterate over the elements of the tuple and multiply each element with the next element.
The resulting list will be `[1*5, 5*7, 7*8, 8*10]`, which is `[5, 35, 56, 80]`.
The function will then return this list as a tuple.

<<<Output>>>
(5, 35, 56, 80)
