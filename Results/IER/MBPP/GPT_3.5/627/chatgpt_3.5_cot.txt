<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_First_Missing` takes an array as input and finds the first missing number in the array. It uses a binary search algorithm to find the missing number.

The function first checks if the `end` parameter is None. If it is, it sets `end` to the length of the array minus 1. This allows the function to be called with only the array parameter, assuming the start index is 0 and the end index is the last index of the array.

Next, the function checks if the `start` index is greater than the `end` index. If it is, it means that there are no missing numbers in the remaining subarray, so the function returns `end + 1`.

Then, the function checks if the value at the `start` index is equal to the `start` index itself. If it is not, it means that the missing number is at the `start` index, so the function returns `start`.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function calculates the `mid` index as the average of the `start` and `end` indices. It then checks if the value at the `mid` index is equal to the `mid` index itself. If it is, it means that the missing number is in the subarray to the right of the `mid` index, so the function recursively calls itself with the `mid + 1` as the new `start` index.

If the value at the `mid` index is not equal to the `mid` index, it means that the missing number is in the subarray to the left of the `mid` index, so the function recursively calls itself with the same `start` index and the `mid` index as the new `end` index.

The function continues to recursively call itself until it finds the missing number or determines that there are no missing numbers in the remaining subarray.
