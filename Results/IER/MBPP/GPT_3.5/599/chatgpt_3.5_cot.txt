<<<Analysis>>>
The variable number is initialized to 10.
The variable total is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to number (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number value in this range, it adds the current value to the total.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the average by dividing the total by the number.
Finally, it returns a tuple containing the total and the average.
<<<Output>>>
(55, 5.5)
