<<<Analysis>>>
The function `neg_nos` takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the negative numbers from the input list.
In this case, the input list is [-1, 4, 5, -6].
The function initializes an empty list called `out`, which will be used to store the negative numbers.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over each element `num` in the input list.
Inside the loop, it checks if `num` is less than 0. If it is, it appends `num` to the `out` list.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the `out` list, which contains the negative numbers from the input list.
<<<Output>>>
[-1, -6]
