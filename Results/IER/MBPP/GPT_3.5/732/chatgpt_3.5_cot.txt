<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called replace_specialchar that takes a string as input.
Inside the function, it uses the re.sub() function from the re module to replace any occurrence of a space, comma, or period in the input string with a colon.
The modified string is then returned as the output of the function.
In this case, the input string is 'Python language, Programming language.'.
The function replaces the space, comma, and period with a colon, resulting in the string 'Python:language::Programming:language:'.
<<<Output>>>
'Python:language::Programming:language:'
