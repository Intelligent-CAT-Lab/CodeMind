<<<Analysis>>>
The function `move_zero` takes a list `num_list` as input.
It creates a new list `a` with the same number of elements as the count of zeros in `num_list`, where each element is 0.
It creates a new list `x` by filtering out all the elements in `num_list` that are not equal to 0.
Finally, it returns the concatenation of `x` and `a`.
In this case, the input list is [1,0,2,0,3,4].
The count of zeros in the list is 2, so `a` will be [0, 0].
The filtered list `x` will be [1, 2, 3, 4].
The return value of the function will be the concatenation of `x` and `a`, which is [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0]
