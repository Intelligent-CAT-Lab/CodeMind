<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the `itemgetter` function from the `operator` module.
The function `index_minimum` takes a list `test_list` as input.
The code uses the `min` function to find the minimum value in `test_list` based on the second element of each tuple.
The `itemgetter(1)` function is used as the key argument to specify that the second element of each tuple should be used for comparison.
The result of `min` is a tuple containing the minimum value and its corresponding tuple from `test_list`.
The code then extracts the first element of this tuple, which is the name of the person with the minimum value.
Finally, the function returns this name.
In this case, the minimum value is 100 and the corresponding name is 'Varsha', so the function will return 'Varsha'.
<<<Output>>>
'Varsha'
