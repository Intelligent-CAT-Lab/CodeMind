<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions and constants.
The function area_tetrahedron takes a parameter side, which represents the length of a side of the tetrahedron.
Inside the function, it calculates the area of the tetrahedron using the formula: area = sqrt(3) * side^2.
The code then returns the calculated area.
In this case, the side is 3, so the area would be sqrt(3) * 3^2 = sqrt(3) * 9 = 9 * sqrt(3).
<<<Output>>>
9 * sqrt(3)
