<<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_rear` takes a tuple `test_tuple` as input.
It initializes an empty list `res`.
Then, it iterates over each element `sub` in `test_tuple`.
For each `sub`, it accesses the last character by using `sub[len(sub) - 1]` and appends it to `res`.
Finally, it returns the tuple `res`.
In this case, the input tuple is `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`.
The function will iterate over each element and extract the last character, resulting in the list `['s', 'r', 's']`.
This list is then returned as the output.
<<<Output>>>
['s', 'r', 's']
