<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_coordinates` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input.
The function calls the `adjac` function with `test_tup` as the argument.
The `adjac` function is a recursive generator function that takes two arguments: `ele` and `sub`.
If `ele` is an empty list, it yields the value of `sub`.
Otherwise, it generates a list comprehension that iterates over a range of values from `ele[0] - 1` to `ele[0] + 1` (inclusive).
For each value in this range, it recursively calls the `adjac` function with `ele[1:]` as the first argument and `sub + [j]` as the second argument.
The generator yields each value generated by the list comprehension.
The `get_coordinates` function returns the result of calling `list` on the generator object returned by `adjac`.
So, the function generates all possible combinations of values in the range `ele[0] - 1` to `ele[0] + 1` for each element in `ele`, and returns a list of these combinations.
In this case, `get_coordinates((3, 4))` will return the following list:
[[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]
<<<Output>>>
[[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]
