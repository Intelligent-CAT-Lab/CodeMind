The function `unique_sublists` takes a list of lists as input.
It initializes an empty dictionary called `result`.
Then, it iterates over each sublist `l` in the input list.
For each sublist, it converts it to a tuple and uses it as a key in the `result` dictionary.
If the key does not exist in the dictionary, it sets the value to an empty list.
Then, it appends the value 1 to the list associated with the key.
This process ensures that each unique sublist is represented as a key in the dictionary, and the value associated with each key is the count of occurrences of that sublist.
After the first loop finishes, the dictionary `result` will contain all the unique sublists as keys and their counts as values.
Then, the function iterates over the items in the `result` dictionary using a for loop.
For each key-value pair, it replaces the value with the sum of the list associated with that key.
Finally, it returns the updated `result` dictionary.

In this case, the input list is [[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [13, 15, 17], [5, 7], [9, 11]].
The function will create the following dictionary:
{
    (1, 3): 2,
    (5, 7): 2,
    (13, 15, 17): 1,
    (9, 11): 1
}
The function will then return this dictionary as the output.

<<<Output>>>
{(1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1, (9, 11): 1}
