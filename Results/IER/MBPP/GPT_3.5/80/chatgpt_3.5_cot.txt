<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code then calculates the tetrahedral number using the formula (n * (n + 1) * (n + 2)) / 6.
Substituting n = 5 into the formula, we get (5 * (5 + 1) * (5 + 2)) / 6 = (5 * 6 * 7) / 6 = 210 / 6 = 35.
Therefore, the return value of tetrahedral_number(5) is 35.
<<<Output>>>
35
