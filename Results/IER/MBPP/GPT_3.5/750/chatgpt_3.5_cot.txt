<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add_tuple` takes two arguments: `test_list` and `test_tup`.
The code first concatenates `test_list` and `test_tup` using the `+=` operator, which appends the elements of `test_tup` to `test_list`.
The resulting list is then returned as the output.
In this case, `test_list` is initially `[5, 6, 7]` and `test_tup` is `(9, 10)`.
After concatenation, the resulting list is `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`.
<<<Output>>>
[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
