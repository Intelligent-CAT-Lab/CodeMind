<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function named Split that takes a list as input.
Inside the function, an empty list named od_li is initialized.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element i in the input list.
For each element i, the code checks if it is odd (i % 2 != 0). If it is, the element is appended to the od_li list.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the od_li list.
In this case, the input list is [1,2,3,4,5,6]. The code checks each element and appends the odd elements to the od_li list. The odd elements in the input list are 1, 3, and 5. Therefore, the function will return [1, 3, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 5]
