<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `_sum` that takes an array as input.
Inside the function, a variable `sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the elements in the array.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element `i` in the array.
In each iteration, the current element `i` is added to the `sum` variable.
After the loop finishes, the final value of `sum` is returned.
In this case, the input array is [1, 2, 3]. So, the sum of these elements would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
