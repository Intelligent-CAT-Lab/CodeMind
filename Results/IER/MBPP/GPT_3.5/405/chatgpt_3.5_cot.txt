<<<Analysis>>>
The variable tuplex is initialized to the tuple ("w", 3, "r", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e").
The variable tuple1 is initialized to the string 'r'.
The code checks if tuple1 is present in tuplex. If it is, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
In this case, the string 'r' is present in the tuple, so the function will return True.
<<<Output>>>
