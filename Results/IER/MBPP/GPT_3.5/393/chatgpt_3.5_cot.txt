<<<Analysis>>>
The input_list is [[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]].
The code first calculates the maximum length of the sublists in input_list using a generator expression. It iterates over each sublist in input_list and calculates its length using the len() function. The max() function then returns the maximum length.
In this case, the maximum length is 3, which corresponds to the sublist [13, 15, 17].
The code then uses the max() function again to find the sublist with the maximum length. It uses a lambda function as the key argument to specify that the length of each sublist should be used for comparison.
In this case, the sublist [13, 15, 17] has the maximum length of 3, so it is returned as the second element of the tuple.
Therefore, the return value of max_length_list([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) is (3, [13, 15, 17]).
<<<Output>>>
(3, [13, 15, 17])
