<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `capital_words_spaces` that takes a string `str1` as input.
Inside the function, it uses the `re.sub()` function from the `re` module to replace occurrences of a lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter with a space between them.
The regular expression pattern `r"(\w)([A-Z])"` matches any word character followed by an uppercase letter.
The replacement pattern `r"\1 \2"` inserts a space between the matched characters.
The `re.sub()` function applies this replacement to the input string `str1` and returns the modified string.
In this case, the input string is "Python". There are no occurrences of a lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter in this string, so the function returns the original string "Python".
<<<Output>>>
"Python"
