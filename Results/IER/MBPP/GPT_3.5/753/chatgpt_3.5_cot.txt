<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_list is initialized to [('Manjeet', 10), ('Akshat', 4), ('Akash', 2), ('Nikhil', 8)] and variable K is initialized to 2.
The code then sorts the test_list based on the second element of each tuple, which is the integer value. The lambda function `lambda x: x[1]` is used as the key to sort the list.
The sorted list is then sliced to get the first K elements, which is 2 in this case.
Finally, the code returns the sliced list as the result.
<<<Output>>>
[('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4)]
