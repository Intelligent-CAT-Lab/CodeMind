<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: is_Power_Of_Two and differ_At_One_Bit_Pos.
The function is_Power_Of_Two checks if a number x is a power of two. It does this by first checking if x is not zero (x) and then checking if x AND (x - 1) is zero. If both conditions are true, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
The function differ_At_One_Bit_Pos takes two numbers a and b as input. It calculates the XOR of a and b using the ^ operator. It then calls the is_Power_Of_Two function with the result of the XOR operation as input. The return value of differ_At_One_Bit_Pos is the return value of is_Power_Of_Two.
In this case, the input values are 13 and 9. The XOR of 13 and 9 is 12. The is_Power_Of_Two function is called with 12 as input. The function checks if 12 is not zero (True) and if 12 AND (12 - 1) is zero (False). Since the second condition is False, the function returns False.
Therefore, the return value of differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13, 9) is False.
