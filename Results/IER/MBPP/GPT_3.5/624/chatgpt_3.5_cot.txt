<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `is_upper` that takes a string as input.
Inside the function, it calls the `upper()` method on the input string, which converts all characters in the string to uppercase.
The function then returns the result of this conversion.
In this case, the input string is "person". When the `upper()` method is called on it, it will return "PERSON".
Therefore, the return value of `is_upper("person")` will be "PERSON".
<<<Output>>>
PERSON
