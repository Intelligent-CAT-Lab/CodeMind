<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `sort_matrix` that takes a matrix `M` as input.
Inside the function, it uses the `sorted` function to sort the matrix `M` based on the sum of each row.
The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is set to `sum`, which means that the sorting will be based on the sum of each row.
The sorted matrix is then stored in the variable `result` and returned as the output of the function.
In this case, the input matrix is [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]].
The sum of the first row is 6, the sum of the second row is 11, and the sum of the third row is 3.
Therefore, the sorted matrix will be [[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]].
<<<Output>>>
[[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]
