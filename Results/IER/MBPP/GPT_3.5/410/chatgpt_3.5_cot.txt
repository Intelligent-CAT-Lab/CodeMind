<<<Analysis>>>
The function `min_val` takes a list as input and finds the minimum value from the list. 
It initializes a variable `min_val` to the minimum value from the list `listval` using a generator expression. The generator expression iterates over the elements of `listval` and checks if each element is an integer using the `isinstance()` function. If the element is an integer, it is considered for finding the minimum value.
The minimum value is then returned by the function.
In this case, the list `['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']` contains both strings and integers. The minimum value among the integers is 2.
