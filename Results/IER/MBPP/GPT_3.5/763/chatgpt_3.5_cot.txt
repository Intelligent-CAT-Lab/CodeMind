<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to (1,5,3,19,18,25) and variable n is initialized to 6.
The code then sorts the array arr in ascending order, resulting in (1,3,5,18,19,25).
The variable diff is initialized to a very large number, 10^20.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider elements from index 0 to index n-2 in the sorted array.
For each pair of adjacent elements in the sorted array, it calculates the difference between them and stores it in diff if it is smaller than the current value of diff.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of diff, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
