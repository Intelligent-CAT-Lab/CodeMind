<<<Analysis>>>
The function `word_len` takes a string `s` as input.
The code first splits the string `s` into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter.
Then, it iterates over each word in the list.
For each word, it checks if the length of the word is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2).
If the length is odd, it returns True.
If the length is even, it returns False.
In this case, the input string is "Hadoop", which has a length of 6, which is even.
Therefore, the code will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
