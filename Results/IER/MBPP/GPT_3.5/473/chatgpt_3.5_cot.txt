<<<Analysis>>>
The function `tuple_intersection` takes two lists as input: `test_list1` and `test_list2`.
The code first creates a set of tuples from `test_list1` by sorting each tuple and then converting it to a tuple. This set is stored in the variable `res`.
The same process is repeated for `test_list2` and the resulting set is intersected with `res` using the `&` operator.
Finally, the resulting set is returned as the output of the function.
In this case, the input lists are `[(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)]` and `[(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)]`.
After sorting and converting each tuple, the sets become `{(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)}` and `{(4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 11)}`.
The intersection of these two sets is `{(3, 4), (5, 6)}`.
<<<Output>>>
{(3, 4), (5, 6)}
