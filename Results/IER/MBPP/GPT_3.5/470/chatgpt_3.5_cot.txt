<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add_pairwise` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input.
Inside the function, a new tuple `res` is created using a list comprehension.
The list comprehension iterates over the elements of `test_tup` and their pairwise sums are calculated using the `zip` function and the `+` operator.
The resulting list is then converted back to a tuple and assigned to `res`.
Finally, the function returns `res`.
In this case, the input tuple is (1, 5, 7, 8, 10).
The pairwise sums are calculated as follows:
(1 + 5) = 6
(5 + 7) = 12
(7 + 8) = 15
(8 + 10) = 18
Therefore, the return value of `add_pairwise((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))` is (6, 12, 15, 18).
<<<Output>>>
(6, 12, 15, 18)
