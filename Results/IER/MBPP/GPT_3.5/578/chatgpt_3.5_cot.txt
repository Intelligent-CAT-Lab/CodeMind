<<<Analysis>>>
The function `interleave_lists` takes three lists as input: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`.
It uses the `zip` function to combine the elements of the three lists into tuples.
Then, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each tuple and flatten it into a single list.
The resulting list is stored in the variable `result` and returned as the output of the function.
In this case, the input lists are [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [10,20,30,40,50,60,70], and [100,200,300,400,500,600,700].
The `zip` function combines the corresponding elements of the three lists into tuples:
[(1, 10, 100), (2, 20, 200), (3, 30, 300), (4, 40, 400), (5, 50, 500), (6, 60, 600), (7, 70, 700)].
The list comprehension then flattens each tuple into a single list:
[1, 10, 100, 2, 20, 200, 3, 30, 300, 4, 40, 400, 5, 50, 500, 6, 60, 600, 7, 70, 700].
This is the final output of the function.
