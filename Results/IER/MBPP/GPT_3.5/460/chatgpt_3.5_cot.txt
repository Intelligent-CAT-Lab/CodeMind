<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Extract` takes a list `lst` as input.
It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each item in `lst` and extract the first element of each item.
The extracted elements are then returned as a new list.
In this case, the input list `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]` contains three items: [1, 2], [3, 4, 5], and [6, 7, 8, 9].
The function will extract the first element from each item, resulting in the list [1, 3, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 6]
