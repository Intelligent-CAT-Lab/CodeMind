<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_difference` takes a list of tuples as input.
It creates a new list `temp` by calculating the absolute difference between the second element and the first element of each tuple in the input list.
For example, for the first tuple (3, 5), the absolute difference is |5 - 3| = 2.
The function then finds the maximum value in the `temp` list and assigns it to the variable `res`.
Finally, the function returns the value of `res`.
In this case, the input list is [(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)].
The absolute differences are [2, 6, 7, 1].
The maximum value in this list is 7, so the function will return 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
