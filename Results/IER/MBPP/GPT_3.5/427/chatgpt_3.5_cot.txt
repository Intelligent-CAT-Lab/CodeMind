<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `change_date_format` that takes a string `dt` as input.
Inside the function, it uses the `re.sub()` function from the `re` module to replace a pattern in the string `dt` with a new format.
The pattern is defined as `(\d{4})-(\d{1,2})-(\d{1,2})`, which matches a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
The replacement format is defined as '\\3-\\2-\\1', which rearranges the date to the format "DD-MM-YYYY".
The `re.sub()` function replaces all occurrences of the pattern in the string `dt` with the replacement format.
The modified string is then returned as the output of the function.
In this case, the input string is "2026-01-02".
The pattern matches the entire string, so it is replaced with "02-01-2026".
Therefore, the return value of `change_date_format("2026-01-02")` is "02-01-2026".
<<<Output>>>
"02-01-2026"
