<<<Analysis>>>
The function `noprofit_noloss` takes two parameters: `actual_cost` and `sale_amount`.
It checks if `sale_amount` is equal to `actual_cost`. If they are equal, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
In this case, `actual_cost` is 1500 and `sale_amount` is 1200. Since they are not equal, the function will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
