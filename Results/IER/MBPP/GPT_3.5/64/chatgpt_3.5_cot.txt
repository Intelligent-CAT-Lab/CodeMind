<<<Analysis>>>
The function `subject_marks` takes a list of tuples `subjectmarks` as input.
The code sorts the list `subjectmarks` based on the second element of each tuple, which represents the marks.
The `sort` function is called with a lambda function as the key argument. This lambda function takes each tuple `x` and returns the second element `x[1]`.
The `sort` function sorts the list in ascending order based on the marks.
Finally, the sorted list `subjectmarks` is returned.
