<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count` takes a list `lst` as input.
The function uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of all the elements in the list.
In this case, the list `[True, False, True]` contains boolean values. In Python, `True` is equivalent to 1 and `False` is equivalent to 0.
So, the sum of the elements in the list would be 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.
Therefore, the return value of `count([True, False, True])` would be 2.
