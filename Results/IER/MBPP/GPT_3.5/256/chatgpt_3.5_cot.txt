<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable ctr is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of prime numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number num in this range, it checks if num is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If num is not less than or equal to 1, it enters another loop that iterates from 2 to num-1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if num is divisible by i. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If num is not divisible by any number in the range [2, num-1], it means num is a prime number and ctr is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ctr, which is 3.
