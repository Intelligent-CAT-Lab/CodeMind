<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 60.
A list called res is created and initialized with the values [0, 1].
The code then enters a while loop that iterates from 2 to n+1.
Inside the loop, it calculates the maximum value between i and the sum of four elements from the res list: res[i/2], res[i/3], res[i/4], and res[i/5].
The result is appended to the res list.
The loop continues until i reaches n+1.
Finally, the function returns the value at index n in the res list.
