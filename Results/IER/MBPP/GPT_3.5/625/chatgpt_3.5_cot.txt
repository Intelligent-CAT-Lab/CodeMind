<<<Analysis>>>
The function `swap_List` takes a list as input and performs the following steps:
1. It calculates the size of the input list and stores it in the variable `size`.
2. It assigns the value of the first element of the input list to the variable `temp`.
3. It assigns the value of the last element of the input list to the first element of the input list.
4. It assigns the value of `temp` to the last element of the input list.
5. It returns the modified input list.

In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3].
1. The size of the input list is 3.
2. The value of the first element of the input list is 1, which is assigned to `temp`.
3. The value of the last element of the input list, which is 3, is assigned to the first element of the input list.
4. The value of `temp`, which is 1, is assigned to the last element of the input list.
5. The modified input list is [3, 2, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[3, 2, 1]
