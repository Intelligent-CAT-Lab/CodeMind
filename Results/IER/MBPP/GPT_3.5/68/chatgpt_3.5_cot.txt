<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `is_Monotonic` that takes a list `A` as input.
The function returns True if the list is either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing, and False otherwise.
To determine if the list is monotonically increasing, the code uses the `all` function with a generator expression that checks if each element `A[i]` is less than or equal to the next element `A[i + 1]` for all indices `i` from 0 to `len(A) - 2`.
To determine if the list is monotonically decreasing, the code uses the `all` function with a similar generator expression that checks if each element `A[i]` is greater than or equal to the next element `A[i + 1]` for all indices `i` from 0 to `len(A) - 2`.
If either of these conditions is True, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
In this case, the input list is [6, 5, 4, 4]. The code checks if the list is monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing.
Since the list is not monotonically increasing (6 > 5) and not monotonically decreasing (5 < 4), the function returns False.
