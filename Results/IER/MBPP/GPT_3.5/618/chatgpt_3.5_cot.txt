<<<Analysis>>>
The function `div_list` takes two lists `nums1` and `nums2` as input.
It uses the `map` function to apply the lambda function `lambda x, y: x / y` to each pair of corresponding elements from `nums1` and `nums2`.
The lambda function divides each element from `nums1` by the corresponding element from `nums2`.
The result of the `map` function is a map object, so the code converts it to a list using the `list` function.
Finally, the function returns the resulting list.
In this case, the lambda function will divide 4 by 1, 5 by 2, and 6 by 3, resulting in the list [4.0, 2.5, 2.0].
<<<Output>>>
[4.0, 2.5, 2.0]
