<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from n to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 10 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is a power of 2 by performing the bitwise AND operation between i and (i-1). If the result is 0, it means i is a power of 2.
If i is a power of 2, it updates the variable res to the current value of i and breaks out of the loop.
In this case, the loop will find that 8 is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to 10, so the value of res will be 8.
Finally, the code returns the value of res, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
