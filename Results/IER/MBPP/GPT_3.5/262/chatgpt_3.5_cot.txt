<<<Analysis>>>
The function `split_two_parts` takes two arguments: `list1` and `L`.
The function returns two parts of the input list `list1`, where the first part contains the first `L` elements of `list1` and the second part contains the remaining elements.
In this case, the input list is `[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1]` and `L` is 3.
The first part of the list will contain the first 3 elements: `[1, 1, 2]`.
The second part of the list will contain the remaining elements: `[3, 4, 4, 5, 1]`.
Therefore, the return value of `split_two_parts([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)` will be `([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`.
<<<Output>>>
([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])
