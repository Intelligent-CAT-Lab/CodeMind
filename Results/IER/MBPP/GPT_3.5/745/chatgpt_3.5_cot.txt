<<<Analysis>>>
The function `divisible_by_digits` takes two parameters, `startnum` and `endnum`.
It returns a list comprehension that iterates over the range from `startnum` to `endnum+1`.
For each number `n` in this range, it checks if any digit in the string representation of `n` is equal to 0 or if `n` is not divisible by that digit.
If any of these conditions is true, the number `n` is not added to the list comprehension.
The resulting list contains all the numbers in the range that are divisible by all their digits.
In this case, the range is from 1 to 22 (inclusive).
The numbers in this range that are divisible by all their digits are 11 and 12.
Therefore, the return value of `divisible_by_digits(1,22)` is [11, 12].
<<<Output>>>
[11, 12]
