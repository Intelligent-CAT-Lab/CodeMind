<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called pancake_sort that takes a list of numbers as input.
It initializes a variable arr_len to the length of the input list.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as arr_len is greater than 1.
Inside the loop, it finds the index of the maximum value in the sublist nums[0:arr_len] and stores it in the variable mi.
Next, it performs two operations on the nums list:
1. It reverses the sublist from index mi to the beginning of the list (nums[mi::-1]) and concatenates it with the sublist from index mi+1 to the end of the list (nums[mi+1:len(nums)]). This effectively moves the maximum value to the beginning of the list.
2. It reverses the sublist from index arr_len-1 to the beginning of the list (nums[arr_len-1::-1]) and concatenates it with the sublist from index arr_len to the end of the list (nums[arr_len:len(nums)]). This effectively moves the maximum value to the end of the list.
After performing these operations, it decrements the value of arr_len by 1.
Once the while loop finishes, it returns the modified nums list.
