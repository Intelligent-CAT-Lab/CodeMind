<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the `groupby` function from the `itertools` module.
The function `pack_consecutive_duplicates` takes a list as input.
It uses the `groupby` function to group consecutive elements in the list that are the same.
The `groupby` function returns an iterator that produces pairs of the form `(key, group)`, where `key` is the common element and `group` is an iterator over the consecutive elements.
The code then creates a new list comprehension that converts each group into a list.
Finally, the function returns the list of lists.
In this case, the input list is [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4].
The consecutive duplicates in this list are [0, 0], [4, 4], [6, 6, 6], and [4, 4].
Therefore, the return value of `pack_consecutive_duplicates` will be [[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]].
<<<Output>>>
[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]
