<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3 and the variable m is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a series of if statements to check for base cases.
First, it checks if m is greater than or equal to n or if n is equal to 0. In this case, neither condition is true, so it continues to the next if statement.
Next, it checks if m is equal to 0. Again, this condition is not true, so it continues to the return statement.
The return statement calculates the value of the Eulerian number using recursion.
It calls the eulerian_num function with the arguments (n - 1, m - 1) and multiplies it by (n - m).
It also calls the eulerian_num function with the arguments (n - 1, m) and multiplies it by (m + 1).
Finally, it adds the two results together and returns the final value.
In this case, the function will make recursive calls with the arguments (2, 0) and (2, 1).
The base case will be reached when n is equal to 0 or m is equal to 0.
The final return value will be the sum of the two recursive calls, which is 4.
