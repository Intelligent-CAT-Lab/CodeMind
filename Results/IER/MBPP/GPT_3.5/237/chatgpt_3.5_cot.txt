<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the Counter class from the collections module.
The function check_occurences takes a list of tuples as input.
Inside the function, the code maps each tuple in the input list to a sorted version of itself using the map() function. This means that each tuple is sorted in ascending order.
The code then converts each sorted tuple into a tuple of integers using the tuple() function.
The Counter class is then used to count the occurrences of each unique tuple in the list of sorted tuples. The result is stored in the res variable as a dictionary.
Finally, the function returns the res dictionary.
In this case, the input list is [(3, 1), (1, 3), (2, 5), (5, 2), (6, 3)].
After sorting each tuple, the list becomes [(1, 3), (1, 3), (2, 5), (2, 5), (3, 6)].
The Counter class counts the occurrences of each unique tuple, resulting in the dictionary {(1, 3): 2, (2, 5): 2, (3, 6): 1}.
<<<Output>>>
{(1, 3): 2, (2, 5): 2, (3, 6): 1}
