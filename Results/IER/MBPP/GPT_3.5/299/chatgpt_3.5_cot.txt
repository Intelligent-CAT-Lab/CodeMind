The code imports the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module.
The function `max_aggregate` takes a list of tuples `stdata` as input.
Inside the function, a `defaultdict` object `temp` is created, which will store the aggregate marks for each student.
The code then iterates over each tuple in `stdata`. For each tuple, it extracts the name and marks and adds the marks to the corresponding entry in `temp`.
Finally, the code returns the maximum value in `temp` using the `max` function and the `key` argument, which specifies that the maximum should be determined based on the second element of each tuple (the marks).
In this case, the input `max_aggregate([('Juan Whelan',90),('Sabah Colley',88),('Peter Nichols',7),('Juan Whelan',122),('Sabah Colley',84)])` will result in the following steps:
1. The first tuple is ('Juan Whelan', 90). The name is 'Juan Whelan' and the marks are 90. The code adds 90 to the entry for 'Juan Whelan' in `temp`.
2. The second tuple is ('Sabah Colley', 88). The name is 'Sabah Colley' and the marks are 88. The code adds 88 to the entry for 'Sabah Colley' in `temp`.
3. The third tuple is ('Peter Nichols', 7). The name is 'Peter Nichols' and the marks are 7. The code adds 7 to the entry for 'Peter Nichols' in `temp`.
4. The fourth tuple is ('Juan Whelan', 122). The name is 'Juan Whelan' and the marks are 122. The code adds 122 to the entry for 'Juan Whelan' in `temp`.
5. The fifth tuple is ('Sabah Colley', 84). The name is 'Sabah Colley' and the marks are 84. The code adds 84 to the entry for 'Sabah Colley' in `temp`.
6. The code then returns the maximum value in `temp`, which is ('Juan Whelan', 212).
<<<Output>>>
('Juan Whelan', 212)
