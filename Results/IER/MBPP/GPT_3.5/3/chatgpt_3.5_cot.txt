<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called is_not_prime that takes an integer n as input.
The variable result is initialized to False.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it sets result to True.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of result.
In this case, the input is 2. The loop does not execute because the range is from 2 to the square root of 2, which is less than 2. Therefore, the code returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
