<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [1,2,1] and variable n is initialized to 3.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.
The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n-1, and the inner loop iterates from i+1 to n-1.
For each pair of indices (i, j) where i < j, it checks if the elements at those indices in the array are not equal. If they are not equal, it increments cnt by 1.
In this case, the pairs that satisfy the condition are (1, 2) and (2, 1), so cnt will be incremented by 2.
After the loops finish, the code returns the final value of cnt, which is 2.
