<<<Analysis>>>
The function `big_diff` takes a list of numbers as input.
It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list using the `max` and `min` functions.
In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4].
The maximum value in the list is 4 and the minimum value is 1.
So, the difference is 4 - 1 = 3.
The function returns this difference as the output.
