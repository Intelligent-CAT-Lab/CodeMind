<<<Analysis>>>
The function `union_elements` takes two tuples as input: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
The code first concatenates the two tuples using the `+` operator, resulting in a new tuple that contains all the elements from both tuples.
Then, the code converts this new tuple into a set using the `set()` function. A set is an unordered collection of unique elements, so any duplicate elements will be removed.
Next, the code converts the set back into a tuple using the `tuple()` function.
Finally, the code returns the resulting tuple.

In this case, the input tuples are `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`.
The code concatenates these two tuples to get `(3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7, 4, 10)`.
Then, it converts this tuple into a set, which removes the duplicate elements, resulting in `{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10}`.
Finally, the set is converted back into a tuple, resulting in `(3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)`.

<<<Output>>>
(3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)
