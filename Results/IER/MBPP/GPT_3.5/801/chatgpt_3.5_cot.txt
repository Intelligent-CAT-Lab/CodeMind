<<<Analysis>>>
The function `test_three_equal` takes three arguments: `x`, `y`, and `z`.
It creates a set `result` containing the three arguments.
If the length of `result` is equal to 3, it means that all three arguments are different, so the function returns 0.
Otherwise, it returns the difference between 4 and the length of `result`.
In this case, the arguments are all equal to 1, so the length of `result` is 1.
Therefore, the function will return 4 - 1 = 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
