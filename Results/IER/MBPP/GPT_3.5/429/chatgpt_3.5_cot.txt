<<<Analysis>>>
The function `and_tuples` takes two tuples as input: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
It initializes an empty list `res` to store the result.
Then, it uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` simultaneously.
For each pair of elements, it performs a bitwise AND operation (`&`) and appends the result to the `res` list.
Finally, it returns the `res` list as a tuple.

In this case, the input tuples are `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`.
The function will perform the following operations:
- For the first pair of elements, `10 & 5`, the result is `0`.
- For the second pair of elements, `4 & 2`, the result is `0`.
- For the third pair of elements, `6 & 3`, the result is `2`.
- For the fourth pair of elements, `9 & 3`, the result is `1`.

Therefore, the return value of `and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` will be `(0, 0, 2, 1)`.

<<<Output>>>
(0, 0, 2, 1)
