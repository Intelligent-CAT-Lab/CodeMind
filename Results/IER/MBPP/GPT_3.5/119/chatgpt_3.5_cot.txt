<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `search` that takes an array `arr` as input.
It initializes a variable `n` to the length of the array `arr`.
It also initializes a variable `XOR` to 0.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the array `arr`.
In each iteration, it performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `XOR` and the current element of `arr`, and stores the result back in `XOR`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `XOR`.
In this case, the input array is [1, 1, 2, 2, 3].
The XOR operation is commutative and associative, meaning that the order of the elements does not matter.
So, the XOR of [1, 1, 2, 2, 3] is the same as the XOR of [1, 2, 3].
The XOR of 1 and 2 is 3, and the XOR of 3 and 3 is 0.
Therefore, the final value of `XOR` is 0.
