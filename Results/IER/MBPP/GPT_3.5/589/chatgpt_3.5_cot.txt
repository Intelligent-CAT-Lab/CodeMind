<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized to 1 and variable b is initialized to 30.
An empty list named "lists" is created to store the perfect squares.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to b (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 30.
For each number i in this range, it initializes j to 1 and enters a while loop.
The while loop continues as long as j*j is less than or equal to i.
Inside the while loop, it checks if j*j is equal to i. If it is, it means that i is a perfect square, so it appends i to the "lists" list.
After that, it increments the value of j by 1.
Finally, it increments the value of i by 1 and the loop continues to the next iteration.
Once the loop finishes, it returns the "lists" list containing all the perfect squares between a and b.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 30]
