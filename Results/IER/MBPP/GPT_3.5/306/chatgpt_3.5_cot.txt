The function `max_sum_increasing_subseq` takes four parameters: `a`, `n`, `index`, and `k`.
The variable `dp` is initialized as a 2D list of size `n`x`n`, filled with zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to `n-1`, which represents the rows of the `dp` matrix.
Inside this loop, another loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`, which represents the columns of the `dp` matrix.
For each cell `dp[i][j]`, the code checks if the element at index `j` in the list `a` is greater than the element at index `i` in the list `a`, and if `j` is greater than `i`.
If both conditions are true, the code compares the sum of the element at index `i` in the previous row of `dp` and the element at index `j` in the list `a` with the value at `dp[i-1][j]`.
If the sum is greater, it assigns the sum to `dp[i][j]`, otherwise it assigns the value at `dp[i-1][j]`.
If either of the conditions is false, it assigns the value at `dp[i-1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`.
After the loops finish, the code returns the value at `dp[index][k]`.
In this case, the input values are `a = [1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5]`, `n = 7`, `index = 4`, and `k = 6`.
The code initializes the `dp` matrix as follows:
[[1, 102, 3, 4, 101, 5, 6],
 [0, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5],
 [0, 0, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 100, 4, 5],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 100, 4, 5],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]]
The value at `dp[4][6]` is 5, so the return value of the function is 5.
