<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized to 99.
The code converts num to a string and assigns it to the variable numstr.
The code then enters a loop that starts from num+1 and continues indefinitely.
In each iteration of the loop, the code checks if the current number i is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. If it is, the code returns i and exits the loop.
In this case, the loop starts from 100 and continues until it finds a palindrome number, which is 101.
<<<Output>>>
101
