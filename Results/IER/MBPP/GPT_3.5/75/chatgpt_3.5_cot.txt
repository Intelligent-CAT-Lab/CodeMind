<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_list is initialized to [(6, 24, 12), (7, 9, 6), (12, 18, 21)], and the variable K is initialized to 6.
The code then creates a new list called res using a list comprehension. It iterates over each sub-list in test_list and checks if all elements in the sub-list are divisible by K. If they are, the sub-list is added to res.
In this case, the first sub-list (6, 24, 12) and the third sub-list (12, 18, 21) meet the condition, as all elements in each sub-list are divisible by 6.
Therefore, the return value of the function is [(6, 24, 12), (12, 18, 21)].
<<<Output>>>
[(6, 24, 12), (12, 18, 21)]
