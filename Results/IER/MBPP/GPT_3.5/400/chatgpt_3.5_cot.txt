<<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_freq` takes a list of tuples `test_list` as input.
The code first creates a new list by iterating over `test_list` and sorting each tuple in ascending order. This is done using a list comprehension.
Then, the code converts the list of sorted tuples into a set to remove any duplicates.
Next, the code converts each tuple in the set back into a tuple and sorts it again. This is done using another list comprehension.
The code then calculates the length of the resulting list and assigns it to the variable `res`.
Finally, the code returns the value of `res`.
In this case, the input `[(3, 4), (1, 2), (4, 3), (5, 6)]` will be transformed into `[(3, 4), (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]` after sorting and removing duplicates. The length of this list is 3, so the return value of the function will be 3.
