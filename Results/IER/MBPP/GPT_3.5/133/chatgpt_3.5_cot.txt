<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `sum_negativenum` that takes a list of numbers as input.
Inside the function, it uses the `filter` function along with a lambda function to filter out the negative numbers from the input list.
The filtered list is then passed to the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the negative numbers.
Finally, the function returns the sum of the negative numbers.
In this case, the input list is [2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17].
The negative numbers in this list are -6, -9, -12, and -5.
The sum of these negative numbers is -32.
<<<Output>>>
-32
