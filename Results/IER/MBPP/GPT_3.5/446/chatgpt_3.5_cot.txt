<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the Counter class from the collections module.
The function count_Occurrence takes two arguments: a tuple (tup) and a list (lst).
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the occurrences of items in tup that are also present in lst.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each item in tup.
For each item, it checks if it is present in lst using the "in" operator.
If the item is found in lst, count is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of count, which represents the number of occurrences of items in tup that are also present in lst.
In this case, the tuple is ('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd') and the list is ['a', 'b'].
The items 'a' and 'b' are both present in both the tuple and the list, so the count will be 2.
