<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
A 2D list called bell is created with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1), filled with zeros.
The value at bell[0][0] is set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider values 1 and 2.
For each value i in this range, it sets bell[i][0] to the value at bell[i-1][i-1].
Then, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to i (inclusive).
For each value j in this range, it sets bell[i][j] to the sum of the value at bell[i-1][j-1] and the value at bell[i][j-1].
After the loops finish, the code returns the value at bell[n][0], which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
