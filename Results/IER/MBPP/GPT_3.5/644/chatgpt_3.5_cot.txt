<<<Analysis>>>
The function `reverse_Array_Upto_K` takes two arguments: `input` and `k`.
The function returns a new list that is obtained by reversing the elements of `input` up to the index `k-1`, and then appending the remaining elements of `input` starting from index `k`.

In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and the value of `k` is 4.
To reverse the elements up to index `k-1`, we need to reverse the elements up to index 3 (since `k-1` is 3 in this case).
So, the reversed elements would be [4, 3, 2, 1].
To get the remaining elements starting from index `k`, we need to get the elements starting from index 4.
So, the remaining elements would be [5, 6].
Finally, we concatenate the reversed elements and the remaining elements to get the final result: [4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6].

<<<Output>>>
[4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]
