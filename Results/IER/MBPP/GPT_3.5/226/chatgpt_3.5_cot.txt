<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `odd_values_string` that takes a string as input.
It initializes an empty string called `result`.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the input string.
For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is divisible by 2 (i.e., if `i` is an even number).
If `i` is even, it appends the character at index `i` of the input string to the `result` string.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the `result` string.
In this case, the input string is 'abcdef', and the code will append the characters at indices 0, 2, and 4 to the `result` string.
Therefore, the `result` string will be 'ace'.
<<<Output>>>
'ace'
