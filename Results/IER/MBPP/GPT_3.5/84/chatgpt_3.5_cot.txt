<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sequence` takes an integer `n` as input.
If `n` is equal to 1 or 2, the function returns 1.
Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with the argument `sequence(n-1)` and `n-sequence(n-1)`, and adds the results together.
The function continues to recursively call itself until `n` becomes 1 or 2, at which point it returns 1.
In this case, we want to find the return value of `sequence(10)`.
To do this, we need to trace the recursive calls and calculate the return value step by step.
sequence(10) = sequence(sequence(9)) + sequence(10-sequence(9))
sequence(9) = sequence(sequence(8)) + sequence(9-sequence(8))
sequence(8) = sequence(sequence(7)) + sequence(8-sequence(7))
sequence(7) = sequence(sequence(6)) + sequence(7-sequence(6))
sequence(6) = sequence(sequence(5)) + sequence(6-sequence(5))
sequence(5) = sequence(sequence(4)) + sequence(5-sequence(4))
sequence(4) = sequence(sequence(3)) + sequence(4-sequence(3))
sequence(3) = sequence(sequence(2)) + sequence(3-sequence(2))
sequence(2) = 1
sequence(1) = 1

Now we can substitute the values back into the previous equations to calculate the return value of `sequence(10)`.

sequence(3) = sequence(1) + sequence(2) = 1 + 1 = 2
sequence(4) = sequence(2) + sequence(3) = 1 + 2 = 3
sequence(5) = sequence(3) + sequence(4) = 2 + 3 = 5
sequence(6) = sequence(4) + sequence(5) = 3 + 5 = 8
sequence(7) = sequence(5) + sequence(6) = 5 + 8 = 13
sequence(8) = sequence(6) + sequence(7) = 8 + 13 = 21
sequence(9) = sequence(7) + sequence(8) = 13 + 21 = 34
sequence(10) = sequence(8) + sequence(10-sequence(9)) = 21 + sequence(10-34) = 21 + sequence(-24)

Since `n` is less than 1, the function will return 1.

Therefore, the return value of `sequence(10)` is 21 + 1 = 22.
