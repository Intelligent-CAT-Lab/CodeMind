<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code then calculates the value of x using the math.sqrt() and math.pow() functions.
The math.pow() function is used to calculate 10 raised to the power of (n - 1), which is 10^1 = 10.
The math.sqrt() function is used to calculate the square root of (2 * 10), which is sqrt(20) = 4.47213595499958.
The code then rounds the value of x using the round() function, which gives the nearest integer value.
So, the return value of the function find_Index(2) is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
