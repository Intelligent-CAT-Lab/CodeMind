<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `lcs_of_three` that takes three strings as input: X, Y, and Z.
The code initializes variables m, n, and o to the lengths of strings X, Y, and Z, respectively.
The code then creates a 3D list called L with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1) x (o+1), filled with zeros.
The code then enters three nested loops that iterate over the indices i, j, and k, representing the positions in strings X, Y, and Z, respectively.
Inside the nested loops, the code checks if any of the indices i, j, or k are zero. If any of them are zero, it sets the corresponding element in L to zero.
Otherwise, the code checks if the characters at positions (i-1), (j-1), and (k-1) in strings X, Y, and Z, respectively, are equal. If they are equal, it sets the current element in L to the value of the element at position (i-1, j-1, k-1) in L plus one.
If the characters are not equal, it sets the current element in L to the maximum value among the elements at positions (i-1, j, k), (i, j-1, k), and (i, j, k-1) in L.
After the nested loops finish, the code returns the value of the element at position (m, n, o) in L, which represents the length of the longest common subsequence of strings X, Y, and Z.
