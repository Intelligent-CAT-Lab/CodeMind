<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 7.
The code then increments n by 1, so n becomes 8.
The code then calculates the logarithm of n with base 2, and adds it to n.
Finally, the code converts the result to an integer and returns it.
So, the code returns the value of 8 + log(8 + log(8, 2), 2), which is approximately 10.0.
<<<Output>>>
