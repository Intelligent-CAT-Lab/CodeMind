<<<Analysis>>>
The function `surface_Area` takes two parameters `b` and `s`.
It calculates the surface area of a shape using the formula `2 * b * s + pow(b,2)`.
The code multiplies `b` and `s` by 2, then adds the square of `b` to the result.
In this case, `b` is 3 and `s` is 4.
So the calculation would be `2 * 3 * 4 + pow(3,2)`.
Multiplying 3 and 4 gives 12, and the square of 3 is 9.
Adding them together gives a result of 21.
Therefore, the return value of `surface_Area(3,4)` would be 21.

21
