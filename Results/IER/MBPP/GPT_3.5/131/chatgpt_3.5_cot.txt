<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "Python".
The code initializes an empty string called "vowels" to store the vowels in the input string.
Then, it iterates through each character in the input string and checks if it is a vowel. If it is, the character is added to the "vowels" string.
Next, the code initializes an empty string called "result_string" to store the final result.
It then iterates through each character in the input string again. If the character is a vowel, it adds the last vowel from the "vowels" string to the "result_string" and removes that vowel from the "vowels" string.
If the character is not a vowel, it simply adds the character to the "result_string".
Finally, the code returns the "result_string", which is the input string with its vowels reversed.
<<<Output>>>
"Python" -> "PythOn"
