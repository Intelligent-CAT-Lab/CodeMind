<<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_index_list` takes three lists as input: `l1`, `l2`, and `l3`.
It initializes an empty list called `result` to store the common elements from the three input lists.
The code then enters a loop using the `zip` function, which iterates over the three lists simultaneously.
For each iteration, it checks if the current elements `m`, `n`, and `o` are equal. If they are, it appends the element `m` to the `result` list.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the `result` list.
In this case, the common elements in the three input lists are 1, 4, and 5. Therefore, the return value of the function would be [1, 4, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 5]
