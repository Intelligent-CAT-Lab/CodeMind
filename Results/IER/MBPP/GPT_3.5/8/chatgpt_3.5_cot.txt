<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called square_nums that takes a list of numbers as input.
Inside the function, it uses the map function to apply a lambda function to each element of the input list. The lambda function squares each element.
The result of the map function is converted to a list and stored in the variable square_nums.
Finally, the function returns the square_nums list.
When the function is called with the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], it will square each element and return the list [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
