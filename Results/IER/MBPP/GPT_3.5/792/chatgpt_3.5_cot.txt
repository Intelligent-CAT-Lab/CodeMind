<<<Analysis>>>
The function count_list takes a list as input and returns the length of the list using the len() function.
In this case, the input list is [[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]].
The length of this list is 4, so the return value of count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) would be 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
