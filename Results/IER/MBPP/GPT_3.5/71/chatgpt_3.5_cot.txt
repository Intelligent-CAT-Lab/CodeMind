<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `comb_sort` that takes a list of numbers as input.
It initializes the variables `shrink_fact` to 1.3, `gaps` to the length of the input list, and `swapped` to True.
It also initializes the variable `i` to 0.

The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as `gaps` is greater than 1 or `swapped` is True.
Inside the loop, it updates the value of `gaps` by dividing it by `shrink_fact` and converting it to an integer.
It also sets `swapped` to False.

Inside the loop, there is another while loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the input list minus `gaps`.
For each iteration, it checks if the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i+gaps`.
If the condition is true, it swaps the elements at these indices and sets `swapped` to True.

After the while loop finishes, the function returns the sorted list.
