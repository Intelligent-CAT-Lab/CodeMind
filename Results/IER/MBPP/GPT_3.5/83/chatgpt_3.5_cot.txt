<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `get_Char` that takes a string `strr` as input.
The variable `summ` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the character values.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string `strr`.
For each character, it calculates the difference between its ASCII value and the ASCII value of 'a' and adds 1 to it. This gives the position of the character in the alphabet.
The calculated value is added to `summ`.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if `summ` is divisible by 26. If it is, it returns the ASCII value of 'z'.
Otherwise, it calculates the remainder of `summ` divided by 26 and assigns it back to `summ`.
Finally, it returns the character whose ASCII value is obtained by adding `summ` to the ASCII value of 'a' and subtracting 1.
In this case, the input string is "abc". The ASCII values of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are 97, 98, and 99 respectively.
The sum of these values is 294.
Since 294 is not divisible by 26, the remainder is calculated as 294 % 26 = 12.
The ASCII value of 'a' is 97, so the return value of the function is the character whose ASCII value is 97 + 12 - 1 = 108, which is 'l'.
<<<Output>>>
'l'
