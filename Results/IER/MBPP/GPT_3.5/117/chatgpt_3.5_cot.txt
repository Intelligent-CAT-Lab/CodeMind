<<<Analysis>>>
The function `list_to_float` takes a list of tuples as input.
It initializes an empty list `res` to store the final result.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over each tuple in the input list.
For each tuple, it initializes an empty list `temp` to store the modified elements.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates over each element in the tuple.
If the element is alphabetic, it appends it as it is to the `temp` list.
If the element is numeric, it converts it to a float and appends it to the `temp` list.
After processing all the elements in the tuple, it appends a new tuple `(temp[0], temp[1])` to the `res` list.
Finally, it returns the `res` list as the output.

In the given input ` [("3", "4"), ("1", "26.45"), ("7.32", "8"), ("4", "8")]`, each tuple contains two elements.
For the first tuple `("3", "4")`, both elements are numeric strings, so they will be converted to floats.
For the second tuple `("1", "26.45")`, the first element is a numeric string and the second element is already a float.
For the third tuple `("7.32", "8")`, the first element is already a float and the second element is a numeric string.
For the fourth tuple `("4", "8")`, both elements are numeric strings.
So, the final result will be a list of tuples with the modified elements: `[(3.0, 4.0), (1.0, 26.45), (7.32, 8.0), (4.0, 8.0)]`.

<<<Output>>>
[(3.0, 4.0), (1.0, 26.45), (7.32, 8.0), (4.0, 8.0)]
