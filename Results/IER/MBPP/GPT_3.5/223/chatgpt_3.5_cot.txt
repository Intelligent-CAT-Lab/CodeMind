<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: `is_majority` and `binary_search`.
The `is_majority` function takes three arguments: `arr`, `n`, and `x`. It first calls the `binary_search` function to find the index of the first occurrence of `x` in the array `arr`. If `x` is not found, the function returns False.
If `x` is found, the function checks if the index of `x` plus half of `n` is less than or equal to the index of the last element in `arr` and if the element at that index is equal to `x`. If both conditions are true, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
The `binary_search` function takes four arguments: `arr`, `low`, `high`, and `x`. It performs a binary search on the array `arr` between the indices `low` and `high` to find the index of the first occurrence of `x`. If `x` is found, the function returns the index; otherwise, it recursively calls itself with updated `low` and `high` values based on the comparison of `x` with the middle element of the current range. If the range becomes empty (i.e., `high` becomes less than `low`), the function returns -1 to indicate that `x` was not found.
In this case, the `is_majority` function is called with the array [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10], the length 7, and the value 3. The `binary_search` function is called to find the index of the first occurrence of 3 in the array. It returns 2, indicating that 3 is found at index 2. The `is_majority` function then checks if the index of 3 plus half of 7 (which is 5) is less than or equal to the index of the last element in the array (which is 6) and if the element at that index is equal to 3. Both conditions are true, so the function returns True.
