<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_Volume` takes three parameters: `l`, `b`, and `h`.
It calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula `(l * b * h) / 2`.
In this case, the values of `l`, `b`, and `h` are 10, 8, and 6 respectively.
So, the volume would be `(10 * 8 * 6) / 2 = 240`.
<<<Output>>>
240
