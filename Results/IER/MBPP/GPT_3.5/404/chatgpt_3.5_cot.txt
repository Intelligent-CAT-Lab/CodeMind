<<<Analysis>>>
The function `minimum` takes two arguments `a` and `b`.
The code checks if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. If it is, then it returns `a`. Otherwise, it returns `b`.
In this case, `a` is 1 and `b` is 2. Since 1 is less than 2, the condition `a <= b` is true and the function returns 1.
