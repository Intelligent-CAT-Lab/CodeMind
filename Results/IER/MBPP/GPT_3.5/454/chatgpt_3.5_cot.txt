<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `text_match_wordz` that takes a string `text` as input.
Inside the function, it defines a regular expression pattern `patterns` which matches any word that contains the letter 'z' followed by any other character.
The code then uses the `re.search()` function to search for a match of the pattern in the input `text`.
If a match is found, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
In this case, the input `text` is "pythonz.". The pattern matches the word "pythonz" in the input, so the function will return True.
<<<Output>>>
True
