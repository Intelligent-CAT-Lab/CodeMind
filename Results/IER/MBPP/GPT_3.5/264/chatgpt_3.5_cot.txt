The variable h_age is initialized to 12.
The code then checks if h_age is less than 0. Since it is not, it proceeds to the next condition.
The code checks if h_age is less than or equal to 2. Since 12 is greater than 2, this condition is not met.
Therefore, the code executes the else block, which calculates the dog's age based on the given formula: 21 + (h_age - 2)*4.
In this case, the dog's age would be 21 + (12 - 2)*4 = 21 + 40 = 61.
Finally, the code returns the value of d_age, which is 61.
<<<Output>>>
61
