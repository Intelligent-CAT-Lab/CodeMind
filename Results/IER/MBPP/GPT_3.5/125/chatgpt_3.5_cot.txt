<<<Analysis>>>
The variable string is initialized to "11000010001".
The code then initializes the variables n, current_sum, and max_sum to 11, 0, and 0 respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider each character in the string.
For each character, if it is '0', the code increments current_sum by 1. Otherwise, it decrements current_sum by 1.
The code then checks if current_sum is less than 0. If it is, it sets current_sum to 0.
The code then updates max_sum to be the maximum value between current_sum and max_sum.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if max_sum is non-zero. If it is, it returns max_sum. Otherwise, it returns 0.
In this case, the maximum value of current_sum is 4, which occurs between the 3rd and 7th characters in the string. Therefore, the code returns 4.
