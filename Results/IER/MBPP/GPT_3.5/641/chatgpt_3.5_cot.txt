<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_nonagonal` takes an input `n` and calculates the nonagonal number corresponding to that input.
The nonagonal number is calculated using the formula `n * (7 * n - 5) / 2`.
In this case, the input `n` is 10.
Plugging in the value of `n` into the formula, we get `10 * (7 * 10 - 5) / 2`.
Simplifying the expression, we get `10 * (70 - 5) / 2 = 10 * 65 / 2 = 650 / 2 = 325`.
Therefore, the return value of `is_nonagonal(10)` is 325.
<<<Output>>>
325
