<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_first_elements` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of `test_tup` using the `enumerate` function.
For each element `ele` in `test_tup`, it checks if `ele` is an instance of a tuple using the `isinstance` function.
If `ele` is a tuple, the loop breaks and the current index `count` is returned.
In this case, the loop breaks when it encounters the element `(4, 6)` at index 3.
Therefore, the return value of `count_first_elements((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10))` is 3.
