<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called max_sub_array_sum that takes two parameters: a list of integers called a and an integer called size.
The function initializes two variables: max_so_far and max_ending_here, both set to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to size-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider each element in the list.
For each element a[i], it adds it to max_ending_here and checks if max_ending_here is negative. If it is, max_ending_here is set to 0.
If max_ending_here is greater than max_so_far, max_so_far is updated to the current value of max_ending_here.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of max_so_far.
In this case, the input list is [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3] and the size is 8.
The code iterates through each element of the list and updates max_ending_here and max_so_far accordingly.
The final value of max_so_far is 7, so the function will return 7.
