<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function named return_sum that takes a dictionary as input.
The function initializes a variable sum to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the values in the dictionary.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the values of the dictionary.
For each value i, it adds i to the current value of sum.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum.
In this case, the input dictionary has values 100, 200, and 300. So the sum of these values is 600.
<<<Output>>>
600
