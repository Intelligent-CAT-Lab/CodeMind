<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `check_expression` that takes a string `exp` as input.
The code first checks if the length of `exp` is odd. If it is, it returns False, as an expression with an odd number of characters cannot be balanced.
The code then initializes an empty stack using the `deque` class from the `collections` module.
The code then iterates over each character `ch` in the input string `exp`.
If `ch` is an opening bracket ('(', '{', or '['), it is pushed onto the stack.
If `ch` is a closing bracket (')', '}', or ']'), the code checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket, so the expression is not balanced and the function returns False.
If the stack is not empty, the code pops the top element from the stack and assigns it to the variable `top`.
The code then checks if the popped element `top` is an opening bracket that matches the current closing bracket `ch`. If they do not match, it means the expression is not balanced and the function returns False.
After iterating over all characters in `exp`, the code checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means all opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, and the expression is balanced. In this case, the function returns True. Otherwise, if the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, and the expression is not balanced. In this case, the function returns False.
