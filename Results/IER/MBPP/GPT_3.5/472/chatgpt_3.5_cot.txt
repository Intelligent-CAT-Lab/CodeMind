<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_Consecutive` takes a list `l` as input.
The function first sorts the list `l` using the `sorted()` function.
Then it creates a new list using the `list()` function, which contains a range of numbers from the minimum value of `l` to the maximum value of `l` (inclusive).
Finally, it checks if the sorted list is equal to the newly created list using the `==` operator.
If the sorted list is equal to the newly created list, it means that the original list `l` contains consecutive numbers.
The function returns `True` if the condition is met, and `False` otherwise.

In this case, the input list is [1,2,3,4,5].
The sorted list of this input is [1,2,3,4,5].
The newly created list using the range function is [1,2,3,4,5].
Since the sorted list is equal to the newly created list, the function will return `True`.
