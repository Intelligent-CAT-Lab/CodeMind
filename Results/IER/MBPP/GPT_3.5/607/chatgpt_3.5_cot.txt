<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `find_literals` that takes two arguments: `text` and `pattern`.
Inside the function, it uses the `re.search()` function to search for the `pattern` in the `text`.
If a match is found, it stores the starting index of the match in the variable `s` and the ending index in the variable `e`.
Finally, it returns a tuple containing the pattern, the starting index, and the ending index of the match.

In this case, the `text` is 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.' and the `pattern` is 'fox'.
The code will search for the pattern 'fox' in the text and find a match starting at index 16 and ending at index 19.
The function will then return the tuple ('fox', 16, 19).

<<<Output>>>
('fox', 16, 19)
