<<<Analysis>>>
The function `kth_element` takes two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `k`, which is an integer representing the position of the element we want to find.

The code first initializes a variable `n` to the length of the input list `arr`.

Then, it enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`, and the inner loop iterates from 0 to `n-i-1`. This loop is used to perform bubble sort on the input list `arr`. In each iteration, it compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

After the sorting is done, the code returns the element at index `k-1` in the sorted list `arr`.

In this case, the input list is [12, 3, 5, 7, 19] and we want to find the 2nd smallest element. After sorting the list, we get [3, 5, 7, 12, 19]. The 2nd smallest element is 5.

5
