<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 12.
The code converts n into a list of its digits and stores it in the variable nums.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the second-to-last digit of nums to the first digit (inclusive), meaning it will consider the digits 1 and 2.
For each digit i in this range, it checks if the digit at index i is smaller than the digit at index i+1. In this case, 1 is smaller than 2, so the condition is met.
The code then creates a sublist z starting from index i to the end of nums. In this case, z is [1, 2].
The code finds the smallest digit y in z that is greater than the first digit of z, which is 2. In this case, y is 2.
The code removes y from z, resulting in z = [1].
The code sorts z in ascending order, resulting in z = [1].
The code replaces the sublist starting from index i in nums with the digit y followed by z. In this case, nums becomes [2, 1].
The code converts nums back into an integer and returns it. In this case, the return value is 21.
<<<Output>>>
21
