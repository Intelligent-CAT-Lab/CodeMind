<<<Analysis>>>
The function `rotate_right` takes two arguments: a list and an integer `m`.
The code creates a new list `result` by concatenating the last `m` elements of the input list with the first `n-m` elements of the input list, where `n` is the length of the input list.
In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and `m` is 3.
The last 3 elements of the input list are [8, 9, 10] and the first 7 elements are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
So, the resulting list `result` will be [8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
<<<Output>>>
[8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
