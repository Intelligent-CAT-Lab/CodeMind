<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called max_sum that takes an array as input.
The code initializes two arrays, MSIBS and MSDBS, with the same values as the input array arr.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the input array arr.
Inside this loop, there is another loop that iterates over the indices from 0 to i (exclusive).
For each pair of indices (i, j), the code checks if the element at index i is greater than the element at index j and if the value in MSIBS at index i is less than the sum of the value in MSIBS at index j and the value in arr at index i.
If both conditions are true, the code updates the value in MSIBS at index i to be the sum of the value in MSIBS at index j and the value in arr at index i.
After this loop finishes, the code initializes another array MSDBS with the same values as the input array arr.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices from 1 to the length of the input array arr + 1.
Inside this loop, there is another loop that iterates over the indices from 1 to i (exclusive).
For each pair of indices (-i, -j), the code checks if the element at index -i (i.e., counting from the end of the array) is greater than the element at index -j and if the value in MSDBS at index -i is less than the sum of the value in MSDBS at index -j and the value in arr at index -i.
If both conditions are true, the code updates the value in MSDBS at index -i to be the sum of the value in MSDBS at index -j and the value in arr at index -i.
After this loop finishes, the code initializes a variable max_sum to negative infinity.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the values in the arrays MSIBS, MSDBS, and arr simultaneously using the zip function.
For each triplet of values (i, j, k), the code calculates the sum of i, j, and -k and updates the value of max_sum to be the maximum of its current value and the calculated sum.
Finally, the code returns the value of max_sum.
