<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `check_greater` that takes two arguments: `arr` and `number`.
Inside the function, the code sorts the list `arr` in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
Then, it checks if the `number` is greater than the last element of the sorted `arr` using the comparison operator `>`.
Finally, it returns the result of this comparison.

In this case, the input `arr` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and `number` is 4.
The code sorts the list `arr` to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Then, it checks if 4 is greater than the last element of the sorted `arr`, which is 5.
Since 4 is not greater than 5, the function returns False.
