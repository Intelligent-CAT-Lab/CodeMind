<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is 'GeMKSForGERksISBESt'.
The code initializes two variables, cnt and res, to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is uppercase using the isupper() method.
If the character is uppercase, it increments the cnt variable by 1.
If the character is not uppercase, it assigns the value of cnt to res and resets cnt to 0.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the last character in the string is uppercase.
If it is, it assigns the value of cnt to res.
Finally, the code returns the value of res.
In this case, the code counts the maximum consecutive run of uppercase letters in the input string.
The maximum run is 'MKS' with a length of 3.
