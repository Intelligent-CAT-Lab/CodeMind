<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several helper functions: str_to_list, lst_to_string, and get_char_count_array.
The main function, remove_dirty_chars, takes two strings as input: string and second_string.
It first calls the get_char_count_array function on second_string to get the count of each character in the second string.
Then, it initializes two indices: ip_ind and res_ind, to keep track of the current position in the input string and the resulting string, respectively.
It also initializes a temporary variable, temp, to store the current character being processed.
Next, it converts the input string into a list of characters using the str_to_list function.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until ip_ind reaches the end of the input string.
In each iteration, it checks if the count of the character at the current position in the input string is 0.
If it is 0, it means that the character is not present in the second string, so it should be included in the resulting string.
The code then copies the character from the input string to the resulting string and increments the res_ind.
Finally, it returns the resulting string by converting the list of characters back to a string using the lst_to_string function.
In this case, the input string is "probasscurve" and the second string is "pros".
The resulting string after removing the characters present in the second string from the input string is "bacurve".
<<<Output>>>
"bacurve"
