<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `is_Diff` that takes an argument `n`.
The function checks if `n` is divisible by 11 by using the modulo operator `%`. If the remainder of `n` divided by 11 is 0, then `n` is divisible by 11 and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
In this case, the input value is 12345. When we divide 12345 by 11, the remainder is not 0. Therefore, the function will return `False`.
<<<Output>>>
False
