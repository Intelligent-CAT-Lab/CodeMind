<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_length` takes a list of lists as input.
It initializes the variable `max_length` to the maximum length of any sublist in the input list. It does this by using a generator expression to calculate the length of each sublist and then taking the maximum value.
It initializes the variable `max_list` to the maximum sublist in the input list. It does this by using a generator expression to compare each sublist and then taking the maximum value.
Finally, it returns a tuple containing the `max_length` and `max_list`.
In this case, the input list is `[[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`.
The lengths of the sublists are `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]`, and the maximum length is `3`.
The maximum sublist is `[13, 15, 17]`.
Therefore, the return value of `max_length([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]])` is `(3, [13, 15, 17])`.
<<<Output>>>
(3, [13, 15, 17])
