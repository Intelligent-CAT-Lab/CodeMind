<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_series` takes an integer `n` as input.
If `n` is less than 1, the function returns 0.
Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `n-2` as the argument and adds `n` to the result.
The recursion continues until `n` becomes less than 1, at which point the function returns 0.
In this case, `sum_series(6)` will make the following recursive calls:
- `sum_series(6)` -> `6 + sum_series(4)`
- `sum_series(4)` -> `4 + sum_series(2)`
- `sum_series(2)` -> `2 + sum_series(0)`
- `sum_series(0)` -> `0`
So the final result will be `6 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 12`.
<<<Output>>>
