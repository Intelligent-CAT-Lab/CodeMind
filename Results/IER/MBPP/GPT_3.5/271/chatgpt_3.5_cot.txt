<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the even powered numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates j as 2*i, which means it will consider even numbers.
The code then calculates the fifth power of j and adds it to sum.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum, which is 512.
<<<Output>>>
512
