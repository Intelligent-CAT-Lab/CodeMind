<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input number n and checks if it is divisible by 2. If n is divisible by 2, it returns True, indicating that n is a sum of powers of two. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating that n is not a sum of powers of two.
In this case, the input number is 10. Since 10 is divisible by 2, the code will return True.
<<<Output>>>
True
