<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called max_Abs_Diff that takes an array as input.
The variable n is initialized to the length of the array.
The variables minEle and maxEle are initialized to the first element of the array.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all elements of the array except the first one.
For each element arr[i] in the array, it updates minEle to be the minimum of minEle and arr[i], and updates maxEle to be the maximum of maxEle and arr[i].
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the absolute difference between maxEle and minEle and returns it.
In this case, the array is (2, 1, 5, 3). The minimum element is 1 and the maximum element is 5. The absolute difference between them is 4.
