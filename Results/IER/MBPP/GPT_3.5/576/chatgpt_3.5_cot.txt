<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `is_Sub_Array` that takes two lists as input: A and B.
It initializes variables n and m to the lengths of A and B, respectively.
It also initializes variables i and j to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as i is less than n and j is less than m.
Inside the loop, it checks if the element at index i in A is equal to the element at index j in B.
If they are equal, it increments both i and j by 1.
If j becomes equal to m, it means that all elements of B have been matched in order in A, so the function returns True.
If the elements are not equal, it resets i to i - j + 1 and j to 0.
This means that it starts checking for a subarray match from the next index in A.
If the loop finishes without finding a subarray match, the function returns False.
In this case, A = [1,4,3,5] and B = [1,2].
The code will iterate through A and B, comparing the elements at each index.
Since A[0] = 1 and B[0] = 1, i and j are incremented by 1.
Since A[1] = 4 and B[1] = 2, i is reset to 1 and j is reset to 0.
Since A[1] = 4 and B[0] = 1, i and j are incremented by 1.
Since A[2] = 3 and B[1] = 2, i is reset to 2 and j is reset to 0.
Since A[2] = 3 and B[0] = 1, i and j are incremented by 1.
Since A[3] = 5 and B[1] = 2, i is reset to 3 and j is reset to 0.
Since A[3] = 5 and B[0] = 1, i and j are incremented by 1.
Since j becomes equal to m (2), the function returns True.
