<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the `deepcopy` function from the `copy` module.
The function `colon_tuplex` takes three arguments: `tuplex`, `m`, and `n`.
Inside the function, a deep copy of `tuplex` is created and assigned to the variable `tuplex_colon`.
The code then appends the value `n` to the list at index `m` in `tuplex_colon`.
Finally, the function returns `tuplex_colon`.
In this case, the input `tuplex` is `("HELLO", 5, [], True)`, `m` is `2`, and `n` is `50`.
So, the code will create a deep copy of `tuplex`, which will be `("HELLO", 5, [], True)`.
Then, it will append `50` to the list at index `2` in the copied tuple, resulting in `("HELLO", 5, [50], True)`.
The function will return this modified tuple.
<<<Output>>>
("HELLO", 5, [50], True)
