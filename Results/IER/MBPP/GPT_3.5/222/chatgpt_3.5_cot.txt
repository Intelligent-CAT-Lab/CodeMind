<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_type` takes a tuple `test_tuple` as input.
It initializes a variable `res` to True, which will be used to store the result of the check.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over each element `ele` in `test_tuple`.
Inside the loop, it checks if the type of `ele` is not equal to the type of the first element of `test_tuple`.
If the types are not equal, it sets `res` to False and breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it returns the value of `res`.

In this case, the input tuple is `(5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)`.
The first element of the tuple is 5, so the code checks if the type of each element in the tuple is int.
Since all elements in the tuple are integers, the code does not set `res` to False and the loop completes.
Therefore, the function returns True.

True
