<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_lucas` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth number in the Lucas series.
The Lucas series is defined as follows:
- The 0th number is 2.
- The 1st number is 1.
- The nth number is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers in the series.

In this case, we are interested in finding the 9th number in the Lucas series.

To find the 9th number, the function first checks if `n` is equal to 0. Since it is not, it proceeds to the next condition.

Next, the function checks if `n` is equal to 1. Since it is not, it proceeds to the return statement.

The return statement calls the `find_lucas` function recursively with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments and adds the results together.

The recursive calls continue until `n` reaches 0 or 1, at which point the base cases are reached and the function starts returning values.

The recursive calls can be visualized as follows:
find_lucas(9) -> find_lucas(8) + find_lucas(7)
find_lucas(8) -> find_lucas(7) + find_lucas(6)
find_lucas(7) -> find_lucas(6) + find_lucas(5)
find_lucas(6) -> find_lucas(5) + find_lucas(4)
find_lucas(5) -> find_lucas(4) + find_lucas(3)
find_lucas(4) -> find_lucas(3) + find_lucas(2)
find_lucas(3) -> find_lucas(2) + find_lucas(1)
find_lucas(2) -> find_lucas(1) + find_lucas(0)
find_lucas(1) -> 1
find_lucas(0) -> 2

By substituting the base cases and working our way up, we can calculate the value of `find_lucas(9)`.
