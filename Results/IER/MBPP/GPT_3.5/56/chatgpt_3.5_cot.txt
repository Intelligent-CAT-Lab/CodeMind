<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: rev(num) and check(n).
The rev(num) function takes an integer num as input and reverses its digits. It initializes a variable rev_num to 0 and enters a while loop. In each iteration of the loop, it multiplies rev_num by 10 and adds the last digit of num to it. Then, it updates num by removing the last digit. This process continues until num becomes 0. Finally, it returns the reversed number rev_num.
The check(n) function takes an integer n as input. It calls the rev() function with n as the argument and multiplies the result by 2. It then checks if the doubled reversed number is equal to n + 1. If it is, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

In this case, the input to the check() function is 70.
The rev() function is called with 70 as the argument. It reverses the digits of 70, resulting in 7. The doubled reversed number is 14.
The check() function checks if 14 is equal to 70 + 1, which is False.
Therefore, the return value of check(70) is False.
