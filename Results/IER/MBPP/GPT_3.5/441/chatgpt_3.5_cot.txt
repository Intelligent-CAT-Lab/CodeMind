<<<Analysis>>>
The variable l is initialized to 5.
The code then calculates the surface area of a cube using the formula 6*l*l, where l is the length of the side of the cube.
In this case, the length of the side is 5, so the surface area is 6*5*5 = 150.
Finally, the code returns the value of surfacearea, which is 150.
<<<Output>>>
150
