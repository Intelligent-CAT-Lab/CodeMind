<<<Analysis>>>
The function `convert_list_dictionary` takes three lists as input: l1, l2, and l3.
The code uses the `zip` function to iterate over the three lists simultaneously and create a new list of dictionaries.
For each iteration, it creates a dictionary with the value of l1 as the key, and a nested dictionary with the values of l2 and l3 as the keys and values, respectively.
The result is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has the structure {l1: {l2: l3}}.
In this case, the input lists are:
l1 = ["S001", "S002", "S003", "S004"]
l2 = ["Adina Park", "Leyton Marsh", "Duncan Boyle", "Saim Richards"]
l3 = [85, 98, 89, 92]
The code will iterate over these lists and create the following list of dictionaries:
[{"S001": {"Adina Park": 85}}, {"S002": {"Leyton Marsh": 98}}, {"S003": {"Duncan Boyle": 89}}, {"S004": {"Saim Richards": 92}}]
<<<Output>>>
[{"S001": {"Adina Park": 85}}, {"S002": {"Leyton Marsh": 98}}, {"S003": {"Duncan Boyle": 89}}, {"S004": {"Saim Richards": 92}}]
