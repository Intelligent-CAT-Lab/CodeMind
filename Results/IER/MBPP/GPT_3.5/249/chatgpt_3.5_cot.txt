<<<Analysis>>>
The function `intersection_array` takes two arrays as input: `array_nums1` and `array_nums2`.
It uses the `filter` function along with a lambda function to filter out elements from `array_nums2` that are also present in `array_nums1`.
The lambda function checks if each element `x` in `array_nums2` is present in `array_nums1`.
The filtered elements are then converted into a list and stored in the variable `result`.
Finally, the function returns the `result` list.
In this case, the common elements between `array_nums1` and `array_nums2` are [1, 2, 8, 9].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 8, 9]
