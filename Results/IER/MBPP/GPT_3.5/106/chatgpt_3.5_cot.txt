<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add_lists` takes two arguments: `test_list` and `test_tup`.
It converts `test_tup` to a list using the `list()` function and then concatenates it with `test_list` using the `+` operator.
The result is then converted back to a tuple using the `tuple()` function and stored in the variable `res`.
Finally, the function returns `res`.
In this case, `test_list` is [5, 6, 7] and `test_tup` is (9, 10).
The code converts `test_tup` to a list, which becomes [9, 10].
Then it concatenates [9, 10] with [5, 6, 7], resulting in [9, 10, 5, 6, 7].
This list is then converted back to a tuple, which becomes (9, 10, 5, 6, 7).
Therefore, the return value of `add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` is (9, 10, 5, 6, 7).
<<<Output>>>
(9, 10, 5, 6, 7)
