<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_list` takes two lists as input: `lst1` and `lst2`.
It creates a new list `res_list` using a list comprehension. The comprehension iterates over the indices of `lst1` (or `lst2`, since they have the same length) and adds the corresponding elements from `lst1` and `lst2`.
In this case, the comprehension will create a new list `[10+15, 20+25, 30+35]`, which evaluates to `[25, 45, 65]`.
Finally, the function returns `res_list`, which is `[25, 45, 65]`.
<<<Output>>>
[25, 45, 65]
