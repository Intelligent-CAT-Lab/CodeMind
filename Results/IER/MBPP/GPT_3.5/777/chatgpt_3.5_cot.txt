<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `find_sum` that takes an array `arr` as input.
The code first sorts the array in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
Then, it initializes a variable `sum` to the first element of the sorted array `arr[0]`.
Next, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the array minus 1.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is not equal to the next element `arr[i+1]`.
If the condition is true, it adds the next element to the `sum` variable.
Finally, it returns the value of `sum`.

In this case, the input array is [1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6].
After sorting the array, it becomes [1,1,1,2,3,4,5,6].
The loop iterates from 0 to 6 (length of the array minus 1).
At each iteration, it checks if the current element is not equal to the next element.
Starting from the first element, it adds the next element to the `sum` variable if they are different.
So, the sum is calculated as 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21.
Therefore, the return value of `find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6])` is 21.
