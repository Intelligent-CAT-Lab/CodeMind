<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `big_sum` that takes a list of numbers as input.
Inside the function, it calculates the sum of the largest and smallest numbers in the list and stores it in the variable `sum`.
Finally, it returns the value of `sum`.
In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3]. The largest number is 3 and the smallest number is 1. So, the sum would be 3 + 1 = 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
