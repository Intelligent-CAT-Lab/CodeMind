<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `remove_whitespaces` that takes a string `text1` as input.
Inside the function, it uses the `re.sub()` function from the `re` module to substitute all occurrences of one or more whitespace characters (`\s+`) with an empty string (`''`).
In other words, it removes all whitespace characters from the input string.
The function then returns the modified string.
In this case, the input string is `' Google    Flutter '`.
After removing the whitespace characters, the resulting string is `'GoogleFlutter'`.
<<<Output>>>
'GoogleFlutter'
