<<<Analysis>>>
The variable l is initialized to 5.
The code then calculates the lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube using the formula LSA = 4 * (l * l), where l is the length of one side of the cube.
In this case, the length of one side is 5, so the LSA would be 4 * (5 * 5) = 100.
The code then returns the value of LSA, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
