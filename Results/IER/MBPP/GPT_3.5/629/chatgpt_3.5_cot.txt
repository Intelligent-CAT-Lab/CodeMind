<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function named Split that takes a list as input.
Inside the function, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the even numbers from the input list.
The condition for an element to be included in the new list is that it should be divisible by 2 without any remainder (i.e., num % 2 == 0).
The function then returns this new list.
In this case, the input list is [1,2,3,4,5].
The code checks each number in the list and includes it in the new list if it is even.
The even numbers in the input list are 2 and 4.
Therefore, the return value of the function would be [2, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 4]
