<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_median` takes three arguments: `arr1`, `arr2`, and `n`.
The variables `i` and `j` are initialized to 0, which will be used as indices to iterate over `arr1` and `arr2` respectively.
The variables `m1` and `m2` are initialized to -1, which will be used to store the two middle elements of the merged array.
The variable `count` is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of elements processed so far.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until `count` is less than `n + 1`.
In each iteration of the loop, `count` is incremented by 1.
The code then checks if either `i` or `j` has reached the end of their respective arrays.
If `i` has reached the end of `arr1`, it means that all elements of `arr1` have been processed. In this case, the code sets `m1` to the current value of `m2` and `m2` to the first element of `arr2`. It then breaks out of the loop.
If `j` has reached the end of `arr2`, it means that all elements of `arr2` have been processed. In this case, the code sets `m1` to the current value of `m2` and `m2` to the first element of `arr1`. It then breaks out of the loop.
If neither `i` nor `j` has reached the end of their respective arrays, the code compares the current elements of `arr1` and `arr2`.
If the current element of `arr1` is less than or equal to the current element of `arr2`, it means that the next element in the merged array should be from `arr1`. In this case, the code sets `m1` to the current value of `m2` and `m2` to the current element of `arr1`. It then increments `i` by 1.
If the current element of `arr1` is greater than the current element of `arr2`, it means that the next element in the merged array should be from `arr2`. In this case, the code sets `m1` to the current value of `m2` and `m2` to the current element of `arr2`. It then increments `j` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the median by adding `m1` and `m2` and dividing the sum by 2. The result is returned.
