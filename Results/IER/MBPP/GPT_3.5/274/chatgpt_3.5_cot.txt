<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called even_binomial_Coeff_Sum that takes an integer n as input.
Inside the function, it calculates the value of (1 << (n - 1)), where << is the left shift operator.
The left shift operator shifts the binary representation of the number 1 by (n - 1) positions to the left.
In other words, it multiplies 1 by 2 raised to the power of (n - 1).
So, for n = 4, the code calculates (1 << (4 - 1)) = (1 << 3) = 1 * 2^3 = 8.
Therefore, the return value of even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(4) is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
