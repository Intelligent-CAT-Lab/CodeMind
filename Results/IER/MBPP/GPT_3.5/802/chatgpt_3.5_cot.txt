<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called count_rotation that takes an array as input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of the array.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current element (arr[i]) is less than the previous element (arr[i-1]).
If this condition is true, it means that the array is not sorted in ascending order and a rotation has occurred.
In this case, the code returns the current index i, which represents the number of rotations.
If the loop finishes without finding any rotations, the code returns 0.
In the given example, the array [3, 2, 1] is not sorted in ascending order, so the code will return 1.
