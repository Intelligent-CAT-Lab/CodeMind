<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `decimal_to_binary` that takes an integer `n` as input.
Inside the function, it uses the `bin()` function to convert the decimal number `n` to its binary representation.
The `bin()` function returns a string that starts with "0b" followed by the binary representation of the number.
The code then uses the `replace()` method to remove the "0b" prefix from the binary string.
Finally, the function returns the binary representation of `n` as a string.
In this case, the input `n` is 8, so the binary representation of 8 is "1000".
<<<Output>>>
1000
