<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code then calculates the centered hexagonal number using the formula 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1.
Substituting n = 10 into the formula, we get 3 * 10 * (10 - 1) + 1 = 271.
Therefore, the return value of centered_hexagonal_number(10) is 271.
<<<Output>>>
271
