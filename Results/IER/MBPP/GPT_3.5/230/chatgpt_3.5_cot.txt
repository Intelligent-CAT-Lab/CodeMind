<<<Analysis>>>
The function `replace_blank` takes two parameters: `str1` and `char`.
It initializes a variable `str2` to the result of replacing all occurrences of a space character in `str1` with the character `char`.
Finally, it returns the value of `str2`.
In this case, the input string is "hello people" and the character to replace the spaces is '@'.
So, the spaces in the input string will be replaced with '@' and the resulting string will be "hello@people".
<<<Output>>>
"hello@people"
