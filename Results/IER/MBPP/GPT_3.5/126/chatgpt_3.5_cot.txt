<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum` takes two parameters `a` and `b`.
The variable `sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of common divisors of `a` and `b`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the minimum of `a` and `b` (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 9 in this case.
For each number `i` in this range, it checks if `i` is a common divisor of `a` and `b` by checking if both `a` and `b` are divisible by `i` without any remainder.
If `i` is a common divisor, it adds `i` to the variable `sum`.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `sum`, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
