<<<Analysis>>>
The function `nth_nums` takes two arguments: `nums` and `n`.
The code uses the `map` function to apply a lambda function to each element in `nums`.
The lambda function takes each element `x` and raises it to the power of `n`.
The result of the `map` function is converted to a list and stored in the variable `nth_nums`.
Finally, the function returns the value of `nth_nums`.
In this case, the function is called with `nums` as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and `n` as 2.
The lambda function will square each element in `nums`.
The resulting list will be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].

[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
