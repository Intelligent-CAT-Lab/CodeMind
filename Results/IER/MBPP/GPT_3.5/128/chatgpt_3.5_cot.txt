<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3 and the variable str is initialized to "python is a programming language".
The code then initializes an empty list called word_len, which will be used to store words that have a length greater than n.
The code splits the input string into a list of words using the split() function, which splits the string at each occurrence of a space character.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each word in the list.
For each word x, the code checks if the length of x is greater than n. If it is, the word is appended to the word_len list.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the word_len list, which contains all the words from the input string that have a length greater than n.
<<<Output>>>
['python', 'programming', 'language']
