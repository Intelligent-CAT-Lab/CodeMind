<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_of_digits` takes a list of numbers as input.
It uses a nested list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and then over each digit in the string representation of that number.
For each digit, it checks if it is a digit using the `isdigit()` method.
If it is a digit, it converts it to an integer using the `int()` function.
Finally, it uses the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of all the converted digits.
In this case, the input list is [10, 2, 56].
The string representation of 10 is "10", so the digits are "1" and "0".
The string representation of 2 is "2", so the digit is "2".
The string representation of 56 is "56", so the digits are "5" and "6".
The converted digits are [1, 0, 2, 5, 6].
The sum of these digits is 14.
