<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and n are initialized to 2, 3, and 7, respectively.
The code then initializes the variable i to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as i * a is less than or equal to n.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the remainder of (n - (i * a)) divided by b is equal to 0.
If it is, the code returns a tuple containing the values of i and (n - (i * a)) // b.
In this case, when i is 1, the condition is met and the function returns (1, 1).
If the condition is not met, the code increments i by 1 and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If the loop finishes without returning a value, the code returns None.
<<<Output>>>
(1, 1)
