<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [5, 9, 7, 6] and variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the XOR sum of pairs of elements in the array.
The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n-1, and the inner loop iterates from i+1 to n-1.
For each pair of indices (i, j) where i < j, it calculates the XOR of arr[i] and arr[j] and adds it to ans.
In this case, the pairs and their XOR values are:
(5, 9) -> 12
(5, 7) -> 2
(5, 6) -> 3
(9, 7) -> 14
(9, 6) -> 15
(7, 6) -> 1
The code accumulates these XOR values in ans.
After the nested loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ans, which is 47.
