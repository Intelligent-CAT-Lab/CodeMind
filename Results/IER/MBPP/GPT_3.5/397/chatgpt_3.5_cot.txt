The function `median_numbers` takes three arguments: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
The code first checks if `a` is greater than `b`. If it is, it further checks if `a` is less than `c`. If this condition is true, then `a` is the median and it is assigned to the variable `median`.
If `a` is not less than `c`, then it checks if `b` is greater than `c`. If this condition is true, then `b` is the median and it is assigned to the variable `median`.
If none of the above conditions are true, then `c` is the median and it is assigned to the variable `median`.
If `a` is not greater than `b`, then it checks if `a` is greater than `c`. If this condition is true, then `a` is the median and it is assigned to the variable `median`.
If `a` is not greater than `c`, then it checks if `b` is less than `c`. If this condition is true, then `b` is the median and it is assigned to the variable `median`.
If none of the above conditions are true, then `c` is the median and it is assigned to the variable `median`.
Finally, the function returns the value of `median`.

In this case, `a` is 25, `b` is 55, and `c` is 65.
Since `a` is not greater than `b`, it checks if `a` is greater than `c`. Since this condition is not true, it checks if `b` is less than `c`. Since this condition is true, `b` is the median and it is assigned to the variable `median`.
Therefore, the return value of `median_numbers(25, 55, 65)` is 55.
