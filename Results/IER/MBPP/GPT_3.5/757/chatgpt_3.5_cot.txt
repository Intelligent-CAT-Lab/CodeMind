<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `count_reverse_pairs` that takes a list called `test_list` as input.
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to store the count of reverse pairs.
The code then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each index `idx` in the range from 0 to the length of `test_list`.
For each index `idx`, it iterates over each index `idxn` in the range from `idx` to the length of `test_list`.
Inside this nested loop, it checks if the element at index `idxn` in `test_list` is equal to the reverse of the element at index `idx` in `test_list`.
If the condition is true, it adds 1 to the list comprehension, effectively counting the reverse pair.
Finally, the code sums up all the 1s in the list comprehension using the `sum` function and assigns the result to `res`.
The function then returns the value of `res`, which is the count of reverse pairs.
