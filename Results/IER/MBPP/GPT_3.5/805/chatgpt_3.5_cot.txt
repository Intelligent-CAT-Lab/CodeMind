<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_sum_list` takes a list of lists as input.
It uses the `max` function with a key parameter to find the list with the maximum sum.
The `key` parameter specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the list.
In this case, the `key` function is `sum`, which calculates the sum of each list.
So, the `max` function will compare the sums of each list and return the list with the maximum sum.
In the given input, the list with the maximum sum is [10, 11, 12], which has a sum of 33.
<<<Output>>>
[10, 11, 12]
