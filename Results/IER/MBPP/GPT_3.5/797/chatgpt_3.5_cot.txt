<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_in_range` takes two arguments `l` and `r`. It calculates the sum of odd numbers in the range [l, r] (inclusive).
The function `sum_odd` takes one argument `n`. It calculates the sum of the first `n` odd numbers.
To calculate the sum of the first `n` odd numbers, we can use the formula `sum1 = terms * terms`, where `terms` is the number of terms in the sequence.
The number of terms in the sequence of odd numbers is `(n + 1)//2`, because every odd number can be represented as `2k + 1`, where `k` is an integer. So, the number of terms is `(n + 1)//2`.
The function `sum_in_range` calculates the sum of odd numbers in the range [l, r] by subtracting the sum of odd numbers up to `l - 1` from the sum of odd numbers up to `r`.
To calculate the sum of odd numbers up to `l - 1`, we can use the function `sum_odd(l - 1)`.
To calculate the sum of odd numbers up to `r`, we can use the function `sum_odd(r)`.
Therefore, the return value of `sum_in_range(2, 5)` can be calculated as `sum_odd(5) - sum_odd(2 - 1)`.
