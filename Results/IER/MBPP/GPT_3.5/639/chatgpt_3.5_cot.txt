<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sample_nam` takes a list of names as input.
It uses the `filter` function along with a lambda function to filter out names that start with an uppercase letter and have all lowercase letters for the rest of the name.
The filtered names are then joined together using the `join` function and the length of the resulting string is returned.
In this case, the names that meet the condition are 'Dylan', 'Diana', and 'Joanne'.
The filtered names are joined together to form the string 'DylanDianaJoanne'.
The length of this string is 15, so the return value of the function is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
