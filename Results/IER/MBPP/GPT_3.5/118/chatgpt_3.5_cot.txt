<<<Analysis>>>
The function `string_to_list` takes a string as input and converts it into a list of words. 
The input string is "python programming".
The code splits the string using the space character as the delimiter and creates a list of the resulting words.
The resulting list is ["python", "programming"].
The function then returns this list as the output.
<<<Output>>>
["python", "programming"]
