<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer n as input and converts it to a string.
It then checks if the length of the string is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it returns False.
Next, it enters a loop that starts from index 2 and goes up to the length of the string.
In each iteration, it checks if the character at index i-2 is not equal to the character at index i. If they are not equal, it means the string is not undulating and it returns False.
If the loop completes without returning False, it means the string is undulating and it returns True.
In this case, the input is 1212121. The length of the string is 7, which is greater than 2.
The loop starts from index 2 and goes up to index 6.
In each iteration, it checks if the character at index i-2 is not equal to the character at index i.
For the given input, the characters at index 0 and index 2 are both '1', and the characters at index 2 and index 4 are both '2', and the characters at index 4 and index 6 are both '1'.
Therefore, the loop completes without returning False and the function returns True.
