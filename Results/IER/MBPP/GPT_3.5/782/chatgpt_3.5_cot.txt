<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `odd_length_sum` that takes an input list `arr`.
The variable `Sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of products.
The variable `l` is assigned the length of the input list `arr`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to `l-1`, meaning it will consider each element in the input list.
For each element `arr[i]`, it calculates a product using the formula `(((i + 1) *(l - i) + 1) // 2) * arr[i]` and adds it to `Sum`.
The formula calculates the product by multiplying the element `arr[i]` with a factor that depends on the index `i` and the length of the list `l`.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `Sum`.
In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 4]. The length of the list is 3.
For the first element, i=0, the product is calculated as (((0 + 1) * (3 - 0) + 1) // 2) * 1 = 2.
For the second element, i=1, the product is calculated as (((1 + 1) * (3 - 1) + 1) // 2) * 2 = 6.
For the third element, i=2, the product is calculated as (((2 + 1) * (3 - 2) + 1) // 2) * 4 = 7.
The final sum is 2 + 6 + 7 = 15.
