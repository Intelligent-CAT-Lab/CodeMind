<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `insert_element` that takes two arguments: `list` and `element`.
Inside the function, a new list is created using a list comprehension. For each element `elt` in the input `list`, the new list is constructed by appending the `element` followed by the current `elt`. This effectively inserts the `element` at the beginning of each element in the input `list`.
Finally, the new list is returned as the output of the function.
In this case, the input `list` is `['Red', 'Green', 'Black']` and the input `element` is `'c'`.
The new list is constructed as follows:
- For the first element `'Red'`, the new list becomes `['c', 'Red']`.
- For the second element `'Green'`, the new list becomes `['c', 'Green', 'c', 'Red']`.
- For the third element `'Black'`, the new list becomes `['c', 'Black', 'c', 'Green', 'c', 'Red']`.
Therefore, the return value of `insert_element(['Red', 'Green', 'Black'] ,'c')` is `['c', 'Black', 'c', 'Green', 'c', 'Red']`.
<<<Output>>>
['c', 'Black', 'c', 'Green', 'c', 'Red']
