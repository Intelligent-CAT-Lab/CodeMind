<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `shell_sort` that takes a list `my_list` as input.
The code initializes a variable `gap` to half the length of `my_list`.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as `gap` is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, the code enters a for loop that iterates over the range from `gap` to the length of `my_list`.
For each iteration of the for loop, the code assigns the current item in `my_list` to the variable `current_item`.
The code then initializes a variable `j` to the current index `i`.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `gap` and the item at index `j - gap` in `my_list` is greater than `current_item`.
Inside the while loop, the code assigns the value at index `j - gap` in `my_list` to the value at index `j` in `my_list`.
The code then decrements `j` by `gap`.
After the while loop, the code assigns `current_item` to the value at index `j` in `my_list`.
After the for loop, the code divides `gap` by 2 using integer division.
The while loop continues until `gap` becomes 0.
Finally, the code returns the sorted `my_list`.
