<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function named `tuple_size` that takes a single parameter `tuple_list`.
Inside the function, it calls the `sys.getsizeof()` function and passes `tuple_list` as an argument.
The `sys.getsizeof()` function returns the size of an object in bytes.
The code then returns the result of `sys.getsizeof(tuple_list)` as the output of the function.

In this case, the input `("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3)` is a tuple containing 6 elements.
The size of a tuple in Python is determined by the size of its elements and the overhead of storing the tuple itself.
Since the elements in the tuple are strings and integers, which have fixed sizes, the size of the tuple will depend on the size of these elements and the overhead of storing the tuple.
The exact size will vary depending on the Python implementation and the system it is running on.

<<<Output>>>
The output will be the size of the tuple in bytes. The exact value will depend on the Python implementation and the system it is running on.
