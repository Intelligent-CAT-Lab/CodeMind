<<<Analysis>>>
The function `index_multiplication` takes two tuples as input: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
It initializes an empty list `res` to store the result.
Then it uses the `zip` function to iterate over corresponding elements of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
For each pair of tuples `tup1` and `tup2`, it uses another `zip` function to iterate over corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`.
For each pair of elements `a` and `b`, it multiplies them and adds the result to a new tuple.
This new tuple is then added to the `res` list.
Finally, the function returns the `res` list as a tuple.

In this case, the input tuples are:
`test_tup1 = ((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10))`
`test_tup2 = ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))`

The function will perform the following calculations:
- For the first pair of tuples, `(1, 3)` and `(6, 7)`, it will multiply the corresponding elements: `1 * 6` and `3 * 7`, resulting in `(6, 21)`.
- For the second pair of tuples, `(4, 5)` and `(3, 9)`, it will multiply the corresponding elements: `4 * 3` and `5 * 9`, resulting in `(12, 45)`.
- For the third pair of tuples, `(2, 9)` and `(1, 1)`, it will multiply the corresponding elements: `2 * 1` and `9 * 1`, resulting in `(2, 9)`.
- For the fourth pair of tuples, `(1, 10)` and `(7, 3)`, it will multiply the corresponding elements: `1 * 7` and `10 * 3`, resulting in `(7, 30)`.

The final result will be a tuple containing the calculated tuples: `((6, 21), (12, 45), (2, 9), (7, 30))`.
