The function `get_pairs_count` takes two arguments: `arr` and `sum`.
The variable `count` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of pairs that sum up to the given `sum`.
The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates over the indices of the elements in the `arr` list, from 0 to the length of `arr` - 1.
The inner loop iterates over the indices of the elements in the `arr` list, starting from the index of the current element in the outer loop + 1, to the length of `arr`.
For each pair of indices (i, j) in the nested loop, the code checks if the sum of the elements at those indices in `arr` is equal to the given `sum`. If it is, it increments the `count` variable by 1.
In this case, the `arr` list is [1, 1, 1, 1] and the `sum` is 2.
The code will check the following pairs of indices and their corresponding elements:
- (0, 1): 1 + 1 = 2 (sum matches)
- (0, 2): 1 + 1 = 2 (sum matches)
- (0, 3): 1 + 1 = 2 (sum matches)
- (1, 2): 1 + 1 = 2 (sum matches)
- (1, 3): 1 + 1 = 2 (sum matches)
- (2, 3): 1 + 1 = 2 (sum matches)
In total, there are 6 pairs that sum up to 2.
The final value of `count` is 6.
