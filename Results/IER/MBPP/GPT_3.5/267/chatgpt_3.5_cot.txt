<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code then calculates the square sum using the formula int(n*(4*n*n-1)/3).
Substituting n=2 into the formula, we get int(2*(4*2*2-1)/3) = int(2*(16-1)/3) = int(2*15/3) = int(30/3) = int(10) = 10.
Therefore, the return value of square_Sum(2) is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
