<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Find_Min_Length` takes a list `lst` as input.
It initializes the variable `minLength` to the minimum length of all the elements in `lst`.
To calculate the minimum length, it uses a generator expression `len(x) for x in lst` to iterate over each element `x` in `lst` and calculate its length using the `len()` function.
Finally, it returns the value of `minLength`.
In this case, the input `[[1],[1,2]]` has two elements, `[1]` and `[1,2]`. The length of `[1]` is 1 and the length of `[1,2]` is 2. Therefore, the minimum length is 1.
