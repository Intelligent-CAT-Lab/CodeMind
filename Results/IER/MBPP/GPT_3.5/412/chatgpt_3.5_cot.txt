<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `remove_odd` that takes a list `l` as input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element `i` in the list `l`.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `i` is odd by checking if `i % 2 != 0`.
If the element is odd, it removes it from the list using the `remove()` method.
Finally, it returns the modified list `l`.

In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3].
The code first checks if 1 is odd, which is true, so it removes 1 from the list.
The list becomes [2, 3].
Then it checks if 2 is odd, which is false, so it does not remove anything.
Finally, it checks if 3 is odd, which is true, so it removes 3 from the list.
The final modified list is [2].

<<<Output>>>
[2]
