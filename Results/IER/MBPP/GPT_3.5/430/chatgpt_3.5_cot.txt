<<<Analysis>>>
The function `parabola_directrix` takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
The code calculates the value of the directrix using the formula `c - ((b * b) + 1) * 4 * a`.
In this case, `a` is 5, `b` is 3, and `c` is 2.
Substituting these values into the formula, we get `2 - ((3 * 3) + 1) * 4 * 5`.
Simplifying further, we have `2 - (9 + 1) * 4 * 5`, which becomes `2 - 10 * 4 * 5`.
Multiplying 10 by 4 gives us `2 - 40 * 5`, which becomes `2 - 200`.
Finally, subtracting 200 from 2 gives us -198.
Therefore, the return value of `parabola_directrix(5, 3, 2)` is -198.
<<<Output>>>
-198
