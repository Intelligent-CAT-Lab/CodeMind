<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the `eq` function from the `operator` module. This function is used to compare two values for equality.
The function `count_same_pair` takes two lists, `nums1` and `nums2`, as input.
The code then uses the `map` function to apply the `eq` function to each pair of corresponding elements from `nums1` and `nums2`.
The `map` function returns an iterator, so the `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of all the True values returned by `eq`.
Finally, the result is returned.
In this case, the `eq` function will return True for the pairs (2, 2), (3, 3), (6, 6), and (7, 7), so the sum will be 4.
