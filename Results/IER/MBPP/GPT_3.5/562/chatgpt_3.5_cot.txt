<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Find_Max_Length` takes a list `lst` as input.
It initializes a variable `maxLength` to the maximum length of any element in the list.
To find the maximum length, it uses a generator expression `len(x) for x in lst` which calculates the length of each element in the list.
The `max` function is then used to find the maximum value from the generator expression.
Finally, the function returns the value of `maxLength`.
In this case, the input list `[[1],[1,4],[5,6,7,8]]` has three elements with lengths 1, 2, and 4.
Therefore, the maximum length is 4.
