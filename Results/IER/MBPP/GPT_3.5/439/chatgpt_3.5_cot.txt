<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `multiple_to_single` that takes a list `L` as input.
Inside the function, it converts the list `L` into a single integer by joining all the elements of the list as strings and then converting the resulting string into an integer.
The code then returns the resulting integer.
In this case, the input list is [11, 33, 50]. When the elements of the list are joined as strings, the resulting string is "113350". This string is then converted into an integer, resulting in the return value of 113350.
<<<Output>>>
113350
