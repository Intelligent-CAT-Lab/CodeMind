<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions and constants.
The function otherside_rightangle takes two parameters, w and h.
Inside the function, it calculates the square of w and the square of h, and adds them together.
Then it takes the square root of the sum using the math.sqrt() function.
Finally, it returns the calculated value of s.
In this case, the function will calculate the square root of (7*7 + 8*8), which is the square root of 113.
