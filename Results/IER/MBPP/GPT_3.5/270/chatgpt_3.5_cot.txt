<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `sum_even_and_even_index` that takes an array `arr` as input.
The variable `i` is initialized to 0 and the variable `sum` is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the array `arr` with a step size of 2, meaning it only considers elements at even indices.
For each element at an even index, the code checks if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., if it is an even number). If it is, it adds the element to the variable `sum`.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `sum`.
In this case, the input array is [5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8]. The loop considers the elements at indices 0, 2, and 4, which are 5, 12, and 18. Among these, only 12 and 18 are even numbers, so the sum is 12 + 18 = 30.
<<<Output>>>
30
