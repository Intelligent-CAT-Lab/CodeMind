<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_num_decagonal` takes an integer `n` as input.
It calculates the value of `4 * n * n - 3 * n` and returns it.
In this case, `n` is 3, so the calculation becomes `4 * 3 * 3 - 3 * 3 = 36 - 9 = 27`.
Therefore, the return value of `is_num_decagonal(3)` is 27.
<<<Output>>>
27
