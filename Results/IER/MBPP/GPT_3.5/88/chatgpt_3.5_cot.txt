<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called freq_count that takes a list as input.
Inside the function, it uses the collections.Counter() function to count the frequency of each element in the input list.
The result is stored in a variable called freq_count.
Finally, the function returns the freq_count variable.
In this case, the input list is [10,10,10,10,20,20,20,20,40,40,50,50,30].
The frequency count of each element in the list is as follows:
- 10 appears 4 times
- 20 appears 4 times
- 40 appears 2 times
- 50 appears 2 times
- 30 appears 1 time
Therefore, the return value of freq_count([10,10,10,10,20,20,20,20,40,40,50,50,30]) would be:
{10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1}
<<<Output>>>
{10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1}
