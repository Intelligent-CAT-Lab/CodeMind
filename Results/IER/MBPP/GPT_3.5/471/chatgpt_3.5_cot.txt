<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_remainder` takes two arguments: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which is an integer.
The variable `mul` is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element `i` in the range of the length of `arr`.
Inside the loop, the code calculates the remainder of `arr[i]` divided by `n` and multiplies it with `mul`. The result is then assigned back to `mul`.
Finally, the code returns the remainder of `mul` divided by `n`.

In this case, the input `arr` is [100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14] and `n` is 11.
The code iterates over each element in `arr` and calculates the remainder of each element divided by 11.
The intermediate results are as follows:
- 100 % 11 = 1
- 10 % 11 = 10
- 5 % 11 = 5
- 25 % 11 = 3
- 35 % 11 = 2
- 14 % 11 = 3

The code then multiplies these intermediate results together:
1 * 10 * 5 * 3 * 2 * 3 = 900

Finally, the code returns the remainder of 900 divided by 11, which is 1.
