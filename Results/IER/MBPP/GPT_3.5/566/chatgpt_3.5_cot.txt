<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a recursive function called sum_digits that takes an integer n as input.
The function checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 0.
If n is not equal to 0, it calculates the remainder of n divided by 10 (which gives the last digit of n) and adds it to the result of calling sum_digits with the integer division of n by 10 (which removes the last digit of n).
This process continues until n becomes 0, at which point the function returns 0.
In this case, the input is 345.
The function first calculates the remainder of 345 divided by 10, which is 5, and adds it to the result of calling sum_digits with the integer division of 345 by 10, which is 34.
The function then calculates the remainder of 34 divided by 10, which is 4, and adds it to the result of calling sum_digits with the integer division of 34 by 10, which is 3.
Finally, the function calculates the remainder of 3 divided by 10, which is 3, and adds it to the result of calling sum_digits with the integer division of 3 by 10, which is 0.
Since n is now 0, the function returns 0.
