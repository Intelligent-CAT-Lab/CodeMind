<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `issort_list` that takes a list as input.
The function uses the `all` function to check if all elements in the list satisfy a certain condition.
The condition is that each element in the list should be less than or equal to the next element.
The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the list and compare each element with the next element.
If all elements satisfy the condition, the `all` function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
The result of the `all` function is stored in the variable `result` and then returned as the output of the function.
In this case, the input list [1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,17] satisfies the condition, so the return value of the function would be True.
