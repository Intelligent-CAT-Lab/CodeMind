<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_dissimilar` takes two tuples as input: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
The code first converts both tuples into sets using the `set()` function.
Then, it uses the `^` operator to perform the symmetric difference operation between the two sets.
The result is a new set containing elements that are present in either `test_tup1` or `test_tup2`, but not in both.
Finally, the code converts the resulting set back into a tuple and returns it.
In this case, the symmetric difference between `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)` is `(3, 6, 7, 10)`.
<<<Output>>>
(3, 6, 7, 10)
