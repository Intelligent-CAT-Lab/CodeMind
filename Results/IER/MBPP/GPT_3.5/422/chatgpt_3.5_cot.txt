<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of cubes.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the cube of i and adds it to the sum.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the average of the sum by dividing it by n and rounds it to 6 decimal places.
The final value is returned as the output.
<<<Output>>>
4.5
