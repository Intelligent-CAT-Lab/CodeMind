<<<Analysis>>>
The variable limit is initialized to 999.
The code first checks if the input limit is an integer. If it is not, it returns the string "Input is not an integer!".
Then it checks if the limit is less than 1. If it is, it returns the string "Input must be bigger than 0!".
If both checks pass, the code initializes an empty set called amicables, which will be used to store the amicable numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to limit (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 999.
For each number num in this range, it checks if num is already in the amicables set. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If num is not in the amicables set, the code calculates the sum of all the factors of num (excluding num itself) and stores it in the variable sum_fact.
Then it calculates the sum of all the factors of sum_fact (excluding sum_fact itself) and stores it in the variable sum_fact2.
If num is equal to sum_fact2 and num is not equal to sum_fact, it means that num and sum_fact2 are amicable numbers. So, it adds both num and sum_fact2 to the amicables set.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the sum of all the numbers in the amicables set.
