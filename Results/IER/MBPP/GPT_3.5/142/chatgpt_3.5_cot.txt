<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_samepair` takes three lists as input: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`.
The code uses the `zip` function to iterate over the three lists simultaneously, creating tuples of corresponding elements from each list.
For each tuple `(m, n, o)` generated by `zip`, the code checks if `m`, `n`, and `o` are equal using the `==` operator. If they are all equal, the expression `m == n == o` evaluates to `True`, otherwise it evaluates to `False`.
The code then uses the `sum` function to count the number of `True` values in the list of comparisons generated by the previous step. This effectively counts the number of tuples where all three elements are equal.
Finally, the function returns the count as the result.
In this case, the input lists are `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]`, `[2,2,3,1,2,6,7,9]`, and `[2,1,3,1,2,6,7,9]`.
The code generates the following tuples: `(1, 2, 2)`, `(2, 2, 1)`, `(3, 3, 3)`, `(4, 1, 1)`, `(5, 2, 2)`, `(6, 6, 6)`, `(7, 7, 7)`, `(8, 9, 9)`.
Out of these tuples, only `(3, 3, 3)` and `(6, 6, 6)` have all three elements equal.
Therefore, the return value of `count_samepair([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],[2,2,3,1,2,6,7,9],[2,1,3,1,2,6,7,9])` would be 2.
