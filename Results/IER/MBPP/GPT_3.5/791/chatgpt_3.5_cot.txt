<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `remove_nested` that takes a tuple `test_tup` as input.
Inside the function, a variable `res` is initialized as an empty tuple.
Then, a loop is started that iterates over each element `ele` in the input tuple `test_tup`.
For each element, the code checks if it is not an instance of tuple using the `isinstance()` function.
If the element is not a tuple, it is added to the `res` tuple using the `+` operator.
Finally, the function returns the `res` tuple.

In the given example, the input tuple is `(1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)`.
The code iterates over each element in the tuple and checks if it is not a tuple.
The elements `1`, `5`, `7`, and `10` are not tuples, so they are added to the `res` tuple.
The element `(4, 6)` is a tuple, so it is not added to the `res` tuple.
Therefore, the final value of `res` is `(1, 5, 7, 10)`.

<<<Output>>>
(1, 5, 7, 10)
