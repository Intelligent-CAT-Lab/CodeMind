<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `sum_Of_Subarray_Prod` that takes an array `arr` as input.
It initializes two variables `ans` and `res` to 0.
It then initializes a variable `i` to the length of the array minus 1.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of `incr` by multiplying the element at index `i` of the array with `1 + res`.
It then adds `incr` to `ans` and updates the value of `res` to `incr`.
Finally, it decrements the value of `i` by 1.
Once the loop finishes, the code returns the value of `ans`.
In this case, the input array is [1, 2, 3].
The code starts with `ans` and `res` as 0.
In the first iteration of the loop, `i` is 2 and `incr` is 3 * (1 + 0) = 3.
`ans` is updated to 3 and `res` is updated to 3.
In the second iteration, `i` is 1 and `incr` is 2 * (1 + 3) = 8.
`ans` is updated to 3 + 8 = 11 and `res` is updated to 8.
In the third iteration, `i` is 0 and `incr` is 1 * (1 + 8) = 9.
`ans` is updated to 11 + 9 = 20 and `res` is updated to 9.
Since `i` is now -1, the loop exits.
The final value of `ans` is 20, so that is the return value of the function.
