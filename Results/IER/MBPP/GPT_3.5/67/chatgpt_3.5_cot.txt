<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
A 2D list called bell is created with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1), filled with zeros.
The first element of bell, bell[0][0], is set to 1.
Then, a nested loop is used to fill in the remaining elements of bell.
The outer loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates from 1 to i (inclusive).
For each iteration, the value of bell[i][j] is calculated by adding the value of bell[i-1][j-1] and bell[i][j-1].
After the loops finish, the code returns the value of bell[n][0], which is the first element of the last row of bell.
In this case, bell[2][0] is returned, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
