<<<Analysis>>>
The function `flatten_list` takes a list as input and returns a flattened version of the list. 
The function initializes an empty list called `result_list` which will store the flattened list.
If the input list is empty, the function returns the `result_list` as it is.
The function uses a stack to iterate through the input list and flatten it.
The function starts by pushing a copy of the input list onto the stack.
While the stack is not empty, the function pops the top element from the stack and assigns it to the variable `c_num`.
The function then pops the last element from `c_num` and assigns it to the variable `next`.
If `c_num` is not empty, it is pushed back onto the stack.
If `next` is a list, it is pushed onto the stack as a copy.
If `next` is not a list, it is appended to the `result_list`.
After the loop finishes, the function reverses the `result_list` and returns it.
