<<<Analysis>>>
The function `unique_sublists` takes a list of lists as input.
It initializes an empty dictionary called `result`.
Then, it iterates over each sublist `l` in the input list `list1`.
For each sublist, it converts it into a tuple and uses it as a key in the `result` dictionary.
If the key already exists in the dictionary, it appends a 1 to the value list associated with that key.
If the key does not exist, it creates a new key-value pair with the key as the tuple and the value as a list containing 1.
After the first loop finishes, the `result` dictionary will contain unique sublists as keys and the number of occurrences of each sublist as values.
Then, it iterates over each key-value pair in the `result` dictionary.
For each pair, it replaces the value (which is a list of 1s) with the sum of the elements in that list.
Finally, it returns the `result` dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{(1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1, (9, 11): 1}
