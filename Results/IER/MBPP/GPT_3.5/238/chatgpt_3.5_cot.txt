<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `number_of_substrings` that takes a string as input.
It calculates the length of the input string and stores it in the variable `str_len`.
Then it calculates the number of substrings that can be formed from the input string using the formula `str_len * (str_len + 1) / 2`.
Finally, it returns the calculated value as an integer.
In this case, the input string is "abc", which has a length of 3.
So the number of substrings that can be formed from "abc" is 3 * (3 + 1) / 2 = 6.
<<<Output>>>
