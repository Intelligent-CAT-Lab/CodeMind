<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10.
An empty list called ludics is created.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it appends i to the ludics list.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes the variable index to 1.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until index is equal to the length of the ludics list.
Inside the while loop, it retrieves the element at index position from the ludics list and assigns it to the variable first_ludic.
It then calculates the remove_index by adding index and first_ludic.
Inside another while loop, it removes the element at remove_index position from the ludics list.
The remove_index is updated by adding first_ludic - 1 to it.
This process continues until remove_index is greater than or equal to the length of the ludics list.
After the inner while loop finishes, the index is incremented by 1.
Once the while loop finishes, the code returns the ludics list.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]
