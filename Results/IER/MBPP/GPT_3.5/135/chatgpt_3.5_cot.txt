<<<Analysis>>>
The function `hexagonal_num` takes an input `n` and calculates the hexagonal number corresponding to that input.
The hexagonal number formula is given by `n*(2*n - 1)`.
In this case, the input `n` is 10.
So, the code calculates `10*(2*10 - 1)`, which simplifies to `10*(20 - 1) = 10*19 = 190`.
Therefore, the return value of `hexagonal_num(10)` is 190.
<<<Output>>>
190
