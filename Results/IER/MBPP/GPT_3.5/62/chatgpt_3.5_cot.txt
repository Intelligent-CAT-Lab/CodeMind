<<<Analysis>>>
The function `smallest_num` takes a list `xs` as input.
The function uses the `min` function to find the smallest element in the list.
In this case, the list `[10, 20, 1, 45, 99]` has the smallest element as 1.
Therefore, the return value of `smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` would be 1.
