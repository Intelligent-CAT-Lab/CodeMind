<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a list of strings ['4','12','45','7','0','100','200','-12','-500'].
The code initializes an empty list called result.
It then iterates over each element in the input list and converts it to an integer using the int() function.
The resulting integers are appended to the result list.
After all elements have been converted and added to the result list, the code sorts the list in ascending order using the sort() method.
Finally, the sorted list is returned as the output.
<<<Output>>>
[-500, -12, 0, 4, 7, 12, 45, 100, 200]
