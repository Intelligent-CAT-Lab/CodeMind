<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `is_lower` that takes a string as input.
Inside the function, it calls the `lower()` method on the input string, which converts all characters in the string to lowercase.
The function then returns the lowercase version of the input string.
In this case, the input string is "InValid". When converted to lowercase, it becomes "invalid".
<<<Output>>>
"invalid"
