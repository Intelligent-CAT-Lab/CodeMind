<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called upper_ctr that takes a string as input.
The variable upper_ctr is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of uppercase letters in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the string.
For each index i, it checks if the character at that index is an uppercase letter by comparing it to 'A' and 'Z'.
If the character is an uppercase letter, it increments the value of upper_ctr by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code immediately returns the value of upper_ctr.
In this case, the input string is 'PYthon'. The loop only iterates once, as the return statement is inside the loop. The character at index 0 is 'P', which is an uppercase letter. Therefore, the value of upper_ctr is 1.
