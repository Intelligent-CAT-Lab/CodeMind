<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_charac` takes a string `str1` as input.
It initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will be used to count the number of characters in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character `i` in the string `str1`.
For each character, it increments the value of `total` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `total`, which represents the total number of characters in the string.
In this case, the input string is "python programming", which has 18 characters.
<<<Output>>>
18
