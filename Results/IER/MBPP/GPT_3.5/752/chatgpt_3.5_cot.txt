<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
A list dp of size n+1 is created and initialized with all zeros.
The first two elements of dp are set to 0 and 1 respectively.
Then, a loop is started from i=2 to n (inclusive).
In each iteration, the value of dp[i] is calculated as dp[i-1] + 2 * dp[i-2].
After the loop finishes, the value of dp[n] is returned.
In this case, dp[5] will be calculated as dp[4] + 2 * dp[3], which is 3 + 2 * 1 = 5.
<<<Output>>>
