<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called max_Product that takes an array as input.
It first checks if the length of the array is less than 2. If it is, it returns the string "No pairs exists".
If the length of the array is greater than or equal to 2, it initializes two variables x and y to the first two elements of the array.
Then it enters a nested loop that iterates over all pairs of elements in the array.
For each pair, it checks if the product of the two elements is greater than the product of x and y. If it is, it updates x and y to the current pair of elements.
After the nested loop finishes, it returns the values of x and y, which represent the pair of elements with the maximum product.
In this case, the input array is [1,2,3,4,7,0,8,4].
The function compares the products of all pairs of elements and finds that the pair with the maximum product is (7,8).
Therefore, the return value of max_Product([1,2,3,4,7,0,8,4]) is (7,8).
<<<Output>>>
(7, 8)
