<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `perimeter_pentagon` that takes a single parameter `a`.
Inside the function, it calculates the perimeter of a pentagon by multiplying the length of one side `a` by 5.
Finally, it returns the calculated perimeter.
In this case, the input value of `a` is 5.
So, the perimeter of the pentagon would be 5 * 5 = 25.
<<<Output>>>
25
