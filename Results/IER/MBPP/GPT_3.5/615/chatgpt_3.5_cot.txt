<<<Analysis>>>
The function `average_tuple` takes a tuple of tuples `nums` as input.
The code uses the `zip` function to iterate over the tuples in `nums` in a transposed manner.
For each transposed tuple, it calculates the sum of its elements and divides it by the length of the tuple to get the average.
The results are stored in a list called `result`.
Finally, the function returns the `result` list.

In this case, the input `((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))` contains 4 tuples, each with 4 elements.
The code calculates the average of the first elements of each tuple: (10 + 30 + 81 + 1) / 4 = 30.5
The code calculates the average of the second elements of each tuple: (10 + 45 + 80 + 2) / 4 = 34.25
The code calculates the average of the third elements of each tuple: (10 + 56 + 39 + 3) / 4 = 27.0
The code calculates the average of the fourth elements of each tuple: (12 + 45 + 32 + 4) / 4 = 23.25
Therefore, the expected output is [30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25].
