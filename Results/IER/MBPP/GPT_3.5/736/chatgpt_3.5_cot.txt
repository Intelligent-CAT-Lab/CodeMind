<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the bisect module, which provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without having to sort the list after each insertion.
The function left_insertion takes two arguments: a list a and a value x.
The function uses the bisect_left() function from the bisect module to find the index where the value x should be inserted in the list a to maintain the sorted order.
The bisect_left() function returns the index i such that all the elements in a[:i] are less than x, and all the elements in a[i:] are greater than or equal to x.
In this case, the list a is [1, 2, 4, 5] and the value x is 6.
The bisect_left() function will return the index 4, because all the elements in a[:4] (which is [1, 2, 4, 5]) are less than 6, and all the elements in a[4:] (which is []) are greater than or equal to 6.
Therefore, the return value of the function left_insertion([1,2,4,5],6) is 4.
