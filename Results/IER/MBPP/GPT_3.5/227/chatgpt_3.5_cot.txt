<<<Analysis>>>
The function `min_of_three` takes three arguments: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
The code checks if `a` is less than or equal to both `b` and `c`. If it is, then `a` is the smallest value.
If `a` is not the smallest, the code checks if `b` is less than or equal to both `a` and `c`. If it is, then `b` is the smallest value.
If neither `a` nor `b` is the smallest, then `c` must be the smallest value.
The code assigns the smallest value to the variable `smallest` and returns it.
In this case, `a` is 10, `b` is 20, and `c` is 0.
Since `c` is the smallest value, the code assigns 0 to `smallest` and returns it.
