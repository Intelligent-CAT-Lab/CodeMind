<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code then calculates the value of the expression (6 * n * (n - 1) + 1).
First, it calculates n - 1, which is 2.
Then, it multiplies 6 by n and (n - 1), resulting in 6 * 3 * 2 = 36.
Finally, it adds 1 to the result, giving a final value of 37.
<<<Output>>>
37
