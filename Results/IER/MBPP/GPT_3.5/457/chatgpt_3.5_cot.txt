<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Find_Min` takes a list `lst` as input.
The function uses the `min` function with the `key` parameter set to `len`, which means it will find the minimum element in `lst` based on the length of each element.
In this case, the list `lst` contains three elements: [1], [1,2], and [1,2,3].
The length of the first element is 1, the length of the second element is 2, and the length of the third element is 3.
The `min` function will return the element with the minimum length, which is [1].
Therefore, the return value of `Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]])` is [1].
<<<Output>>>
[1]
