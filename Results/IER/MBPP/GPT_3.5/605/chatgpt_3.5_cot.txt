<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized to 13.
The code checks if num is greater than or equal to 1. Since 13 is greater than 1, the code enters the if statement.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to num//2 (integer division). In this case, the loop will iterate from 2 to 6.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if num is divisible by i. If it is, the code returns False, indicating that num is not a prime number.
If num is not divisible by any number in the range, the code returns True, indicating that num is a prime number.
In this case, 13 is not divisible by 2, so the code returns True.
