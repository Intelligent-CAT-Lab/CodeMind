<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `maxAverageOfPath` that takes a 2D list `cost` as input.
The variable `N` is initialized to the length of `cost`, which represents the number of rows in the 2D list.
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions (N+1) x (N+1), filled with zeros.
The value at index (0,0) of `dp` is set to the value at index (0,0) of `cost`.
Then, a loop is executed from 1 to N-1 (exclusive), where each iteration sets the value at index (i,0) of `dp` to the sum of the value at index (i-1,0) of `dp` and the value at index (i,0) of `cost`.
Another loop is executed from 1 to N-1 (exclusive), where each iteration sets the value at index (0,j) of `dp` to the sum of the value at index (0,j-1) of `dp` and the value at index (0,j) of `cost`.
Finally, a nested loop is executed from 1 to N-1 (exclusive) for both `i` and `j`. Each iteration sets the value at index (i,j) of `dp` to the maximum of the value at index (i-1,j) and the value at index (i,j-1) of `dp`, plus the value at index (i,j) of `cost`.
The function returns the value at index (N-1,N-1) of `dp`, divided by (2*N-1).
