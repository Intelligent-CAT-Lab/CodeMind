<<<Analysis>>>
The function `empty_dit` takes a list as input and checks if all the dictionaries in the list are empty. It does this by iterating over each dictionary in the list and checking if it is empty using the `not` operator. If all the dictionaries are empty, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

In this case, the input is `[{},{},{}]`, which is a list containing three empty dictionaries. The function will iterate over each dictionary and check if it is empty. Since all the dictionaries are empty, the function will return `True`.

<<<Output>>>
True
