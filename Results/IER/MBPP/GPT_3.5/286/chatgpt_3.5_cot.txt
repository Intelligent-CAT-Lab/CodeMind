<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_sub_array_sum_repeated` takes three parameters: `a`, `n`, and `k`.
The variable `max_so_far` is initialized to a very small value, -2147483648, which is the smallest possible value for a 32-bit signed integer.
The variable `max_ending_here` is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates `n*k` times. In this case, it will iterate 12 times.
For each iteration, it adds the value of `a[i%n]` to `max_ending_here`. The expression `i%n` ensures that the index stays within the range of the array `a`.
If `max_ending_here` becomes greater than `max_so_far`, `max_so_far` is updated with the new value.
If `max_ending_here` becomes negative, it is reset to 0.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of `max_so_far`, which is the maximum subarray sum.
In this case, the maximum subarray sum is 30, which is the sum of the subarray [10, 20] repeated 3 times.
