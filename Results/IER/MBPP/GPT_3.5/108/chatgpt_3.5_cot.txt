<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `merge_sorted_list` that takes three lists as input: `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.
Inside the function, the code sorts each of the input lists using the `sorted` function and assigns the sorted lists back to the original variables.
Then, the code uses the `heapq.merge` function to merge the three sorted lists together. The `heapq.merge` function returns an iterator that yields the elements from the input lists in sorted order.
Finally, the code converts the iterator to a list using the `list` function and returns the sorted list as the output of the function.

In this case, the input lists are:
num1 = [25, 24, 15, 4, 5, 29, 110]
num2 = [19, 20, 11, 56, 25, 233, 154]
num3 = [24, 26, 54, 48]

After sorting each of the input lists, we have:
num1 = [4, 5, 15, 24, 25, 29, 110]
num2 = [11, 19, 20, 25, 56, 154, 233]
num3 = [24, 26, 48, 54]

Merging the sorted lists together, we get:
[4, 5, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 24, 25, 26, 29, 48, 54, 56, 110, 154, 233]

<<<Output>>>
[4, 5, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 24, 25, 26, 29, 48, 54, 56, 110, 154, 233]
