<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: binomial_Coeff and sum_Of_product.
The binomial_Coeff function calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, k) using dynamic programming.
It initializes a list C of size k+1 with all elements set to 0.
Then, it sets C[0] to 1, as nC0 is always 1.
Next, it enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 1 to n+1, and the inner loop iterates from min(i, k) to 0 in reverse order.
In each iteration of the inner loop, it updates the value of C[j] by adding C[j] and C[j-1].
Finally, it returns the value of C[k].

The sum_Of_product function simply calls the binomial_Coeff function with arguments 2*n and n-1, and returns the result.

In this case, the input to the sum_Of_product function is 3.
So, it calls the binomial_Coeff function with arguments 2*3 and 3-1, which are 6 and 2.
The binomial_Coeff function calculates the binomial coefficient C(6, 2) using dynamic programming.
After the nested loop finishes, it returns the value of C[2], which is 15.

Therefore, the return value of sum_Of_product(3) is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
