<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sequential_search` takes two parameters: `dlist`, which is a list of integers, and `item`, which is the item we are searching for.
The function initializes two variables: `pos` to 0 and `found` to False.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as `pos` is less than the length of `dlist` and `found` is False.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the element at index `pos` in `dlist` is equal to `item`. If it is, it sets `found` to True.
If the element is not equal to `item`, it increments `pos` by 1 and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the function returns a tuple containing the values of `found` and `pos`.
In this case, the element 31 is found at index 3 in the list [11,23,58,31,56,77,43,12,65,19], so the function will return (True, 3).
<<<Output>>>
(True, 3)
