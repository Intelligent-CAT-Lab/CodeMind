<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `find_Rotations` that takes a string as input.
Inside the function, a temporary string `tmp` is created by concatenating the input string with itself.
The length of the input string is stored in the variable `n`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n+1`.
For each iteration, a substring of length `n` is extracted from `tmp` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+n`.
If the extracted substring is equal to the input string, the function returns the value of `i`.
If no match is found, the function returns the value of `n`.
In this case, the input string is "aaaa".
The loop starts at index 1 and extracts the substring "aaaa" from `tmp`.
Since the extracted substring is equal to the input string, the function returns the value of `i`, which is 1.
