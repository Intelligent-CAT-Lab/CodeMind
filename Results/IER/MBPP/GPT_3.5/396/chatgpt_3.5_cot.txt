The code defines a regular expression pattern using the re module. The pattern is '^([a-z]).*\1$', which matches a string that starts and ends with the same lowercase letter.
The code then defines a function called check_char that takes a string as input.
Inside the function, it uses the re.search() function to search for a match between the regular expression pattern and the input string.
If a match is found, the function returns "Valid". Otherwise, it returns "Invalid".
In this case, the input string is "abba". The regular expression pattern matches this string because it starts and ends with the same letter 'a'.
Therefore, the return value of check_char("abba") would be "Valid".
<<<Output>>>
Valid
