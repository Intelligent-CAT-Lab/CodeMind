<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_sublists` takes a list of sublists as input.
For each sublist in the input list, the code sorts it based on the first element of each sublist using the `sorted` function and a lambda function as the key.
The lambda function `lambda x: x[0]` specifies that the sorting should be based on the first element of each sublist.
The sorted sublists are then stored in a new list called `result`.
Finally, the function returns the `result` list.
In this case, the input list contains three sublists: ["green", "orange"], ["black", "white"], and ["white", "black", "orange"].
After sorting each sublist based on the first element, the resulting list would be [["green", "orange"], ["black", "white"], ["black", "orange", "white"]].
<<<Output>>>
[["green", "orange"], ["black", "white"], ["black", "orange", "white"]]
