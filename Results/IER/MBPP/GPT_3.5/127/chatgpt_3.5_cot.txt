<<<Analysis>>>
The function `multiply_int` takes two arguments, `x` and `y`.
If `y` is less than 0, the function recursively calls itself with `x` and `-y` as arguments, and negates the result.
If `y` is 0, the function returns 0.
If `y` is 1, the function returns `x`.
Otherwise, the function returns `x` plus the result of recursively calling itself with `x` and `y-1` as arguments.
In this case, `x` is 10 and `y` is 20.
The function will not enter the first condition because `y` is not less than 0.
The function will not enter the second condition because `y` is not 0.
The function will not enter the third condition because `y` is not 1.
Therefore, the function will enter the else condition and return `x` plus the result of calling itself with `x` as 10 and `y-1` as 19.
This process will repeat until `y` becomes 1, at which point the function will return `x`.
So, the function will return 10 + 10 + 10 + ... + 10 (20 times), which is equal to 200.
<<<Output>>>
200
