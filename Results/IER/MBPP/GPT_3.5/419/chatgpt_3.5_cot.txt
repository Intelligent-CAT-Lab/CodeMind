<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called round_and_sum that takes a list as input.
The variable length is initialized to the length of the input list.
The code then calculates the sum of the rounded values of the input list by applying the round function to each element of the list using the map function. The resulting rounded values are then multiplied by the length of the list.
Finally, the code returns the rounded and summed value.
In this case, the input list is [22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50].
The rounded values of this list are [22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18].
The sum of these rounded values is 27.
Since the length of the input list is 9, the final result is 27 * 9 = 243.
