<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_range_list` takes three arguments: `list1`, `m`, and `n`.
The variable `sum_range` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the elements in the range.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from `m` to `n` (inclusive), meaning it will consider elements from index `m` to index `n` in the list.
For each index `i` in this range, it adds the value at that index in `list1` to `sum_range`.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `sum_range`.
In this case, the function is called with `list1` as `[2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12]`, `m` as `8`, and `n` as `10`.
So, it will calculate the sum of elements from index `8` to index `10` in the list, which are `10`, `11`, and `8`.
The sum of these elements is `29`, so the return value of the function will be `29`.

29
