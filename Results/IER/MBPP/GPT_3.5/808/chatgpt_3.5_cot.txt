The variable test_tup is initialized to the tuple (10, 4, 5, 6, 8), and the variable K is initialized to 6.
The variable res is initialized to False, which will be used to store the result of the check.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element ele in the test_tup tuple.
For each element ele, it checks if ele is equal to K. If it is, it sets res to True and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of res, which will be True if K is found in the tuple and False otherwise.
In this case, the element 6 is present in the tuple, so the return value will be True.
