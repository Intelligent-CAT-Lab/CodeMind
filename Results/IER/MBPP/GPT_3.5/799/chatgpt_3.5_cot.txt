<<<Analysis>>>
The function `left_rotate` takes two arguments, `n` and `d`.
The code initializes a variable `INT_BITS` to 32.
The code then returns the result of a bitwise left shift of `n` by `d` bits, combined with a bitwise right shift of `n` by `INT_BITS - d` bits.
In this case, `n` is 16 and `d` is 2.
The binary representation of 16 is 00000000000000000000000000010000.
A bitwise left shift of 16 by 2 bits results in 00000000000000000000000001000000, which is 64 in decimal.
A bitwise right shift of 16 by 30 bits (INT_BITS - d) results in 00000000000000000000000000000000, which is 0 in decimal.
Combining these two results using a bitwise OR operation gives 64.
Therefore, the return value of `left_rotate(16,2)` is 64.

64
