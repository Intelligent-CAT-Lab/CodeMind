<<<Analysis>>>
The variable list1 is initialized to [[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 11], [1, 15, 7]], and the variable x is initialized to 1.
The variable ctr is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times x appears in the list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each element in list1.
For each element, it checks if x is in that element. If it is, it increments ctr by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ctr, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
