<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called is_Even that takes an argument n.
Inside the function, it checks if the bitwise XOR operation between n and 1 is equal to n+1.
If the condition is true, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
In this case, the input value is 1.
The code calculates the bitwise XOR between 1 and 1, which is 0.
Since 0 is not equal to 2 (1+1), the condition is False.
Therefore, the function will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
