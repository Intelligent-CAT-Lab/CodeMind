<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called count_bidirectional that takes a list called test_list as input.
The variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the count of bidirectional pairs.
The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates over the indices of the elements in test_list, from 0 to len(test_list)-1.
The inner loop iterates over the indices of the elements in test_list, starting from the index after the current outer loop index.
For each pair of indices (idx, iidx), the code checks if the first element of the pair at index iidx is equal to the second element of the pair at index idx, and if the second element of the pair at index iidx is equal to the first element of the pair at index idx.
If this condition is true, it means that the pair at index iidx is bidirectional to the pair at index idx, so the code increments the value of res by 1.
After both loops finish, the code returns the final value of res, which is the count of bidirectional pairs.
In this case, the input test_list is [(5, 6), (1, 2), (6, 5), (9, 1), (6, 5), (2, 1)].
The code will find two bidirectional pairs: (5, 6) and (6, 5), and (1, 2) and (2, 1).
