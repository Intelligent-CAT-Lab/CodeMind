<<<Analysis>>>
The variable m is initialized to 10 and the variable n is initialized to 4.
A 2D list T is created with m+1 rows and n+1 columns, filled with 0s.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates through each element of T.
For each element, the code checks if i is equal to 0 or j is equal to 0. If either condition is true, the element is set to 0.
If i is less than j, the element is set to 0.
If j is equal to 1, the element is set to i.
Otherwise, the element is set to the sum of the element above it (T[i-1][j]) and the element at T[i//2][j-1].
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value at T[m][n], which is the total number of sequences.
