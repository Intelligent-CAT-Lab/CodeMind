<<<Analysis>>>
The variable r is initialized to 10 and the variable h is initialized to 5.
The code then calculates the surface area of a cylinder using the formula: surfacearea = (2 * pi * r^2) + (2 * pi * r * h).
The code substitutes the values of r and h into the formula and calculates the result.
The code returns the calculated surface area as the output.
