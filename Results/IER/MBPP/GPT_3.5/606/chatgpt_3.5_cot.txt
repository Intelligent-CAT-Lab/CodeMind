<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called radian_degree that takes a parameter called degree.
Inside the function, it calculates the value of radian by multiplying degree with the conversion factor math.pi/180.
Finally, it returns the value of radian.
In this case, the input is 90, so the code will calculate radian = 90*(math.pi/180) = 1.5707963267948966.
<<<Output>>>
1.5707963267948966
