<<<Analysis>>>
The variable number is initialized to 8.
The code then initializes a list called divisors with the value [1].
The code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to number-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 7.
For each number i in this range, it checks if number is divisible by i. If it is, it appends i to the divisors list.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the sum of all the elements in the divisors list, which is 1+2+4 = 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
