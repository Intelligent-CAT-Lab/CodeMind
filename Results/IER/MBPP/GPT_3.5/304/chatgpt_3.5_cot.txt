<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [1,2,3,4,5], ranges is initialized to [[0,2],[0,3]], rotations is initialized to 2, and index is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from rotations-1 to 0 (inclusive), which means it will iterate twice.
In each iteration, it retrieves the left and right values from the ranges list based on the current iteration index.
It then checks if the index is within the range [left, right]. If it is, it performs a conditional check to determine the new value of index.
If the index is equal to the left value, it updates index to the right value. Otherwise, it subtracts 1 from index.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of arr at the final index, which is 2 in this case.
<<<Output>>>
