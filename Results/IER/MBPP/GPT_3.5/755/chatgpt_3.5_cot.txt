<<<Analysis>>>
The function `second_smallest` takes a list of numbers as input.
It first creates a new list `unique_numbers` by converting the input list to a set and then back to a list. This removes any duplicate numbers and sorts the list in ascending order.
Next, it checks if the length of `unique_numbers` is less than 2. If it is, it means there are not enough unique numbers in the input list, so the function returns None.
Otherwise, it returns the second element of `unique_numbers`, which is the second smallest number in the input list.
In this case, the input list is [1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]. After removing duplicates and sorting, `unique_numbers` becomes [-8, -2, 0, 1, 2]. The second smallest number is -2, so the function will return -2.
<<<Output>>>
-2
