<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code enters a while loop that continues until n becomes 0.
In each iteration of the loop, it checks if the least significant bit of n is 1 by performing a bitwise AND operation with 1.
If the result is 1, it increments the count variable.
Then, it right shifts n by 1 bit, effectively discarding the least significant bit.
This process continues until n becomes 0.
Finally, the code returns the value of count, which is the number of set bits in the binary representation of n.
