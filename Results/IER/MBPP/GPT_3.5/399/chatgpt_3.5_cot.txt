<<<Analysis>>>
The function `bitwise_xor` takes two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as input.
It initializes an empty list `res` to store the result of the bitwise XOR operation between corresponding elements of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
Then, it uses a `for` loop and the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` simultaneously.
For each pair of elements, it performs the bitwise XOR operation using the `^` operator and appends the result to the `res` list.
Finally, it returns the `res` list as a tuple.

In this case, the input tuples are `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`.
The bitwise XOR operation between corresponding elements of these tuples would be:
- 10 ^ 5 = 15
- 4 ^ 2 = 6
- 6 ^ 3 = 5
- 9 ^ 3 = 10

So, the return value of the function would be `(15, 6, 5, 10)`.

<<<Output>>>
(15, 6, 5, 10)
