<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the `groupby` function from the `itertools` module.
The function `consecutive_duplicates` takes a list of numbers as input.
It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the `groupby` function applied to the input list.
The `groupby` function groups consecutive elements in the list that are equal.
The list comprehension extracts the keys from each group, which are the consecutive duplicate numbers.
The function returns a list of these consecutive duplicate numbers.
In this case, the input list is [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4].
The consecutive duplicate numbers in this list are [0, 4, 6, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 4, 6, 4]
