<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `find_adverb_position` that takes a string `text` as input.
Inside the function, it uses the `re.finditer()` function from the `re` module to find all occurrences of words ending with "ly" in the `text` string.
For each match found, it returns a tuple containing the start position, end position, and the matched word.
In this case, the `text` string is "clearly!! we can see the sky".
The code finds the word "clearly" in the string and returns a tuple (0, 7, "clearly").
The code then exits the function and the program ends.
<<<Output>>>
(0, 7, "clearly")
