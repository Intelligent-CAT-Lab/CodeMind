<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called toggle_string that takes a string as input.
Inside the function, it uses the swapcase() method to convert the case of each character in the string. This means that uppercase letters will be converted to lowercase and vice versa.
The modified string is then returned as the output of the function.
In this case, the input string is "Python". After applying the swapcase() method, the string becomes "pYTHON".
<<<Output>>>
pYTHON
