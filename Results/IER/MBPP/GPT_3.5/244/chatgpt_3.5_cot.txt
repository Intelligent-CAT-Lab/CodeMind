<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `next_Perfect_Square` that takes an argument `N`.
Inside the function, it calculates the square root of `N` using the `math.sqrt()` function and then rounds it down to the nearest integer using the `math.floor()` function.
It adds 1 to the rounded down square root and assigns it to the variable `nextN`.
Finally, it returns the square of `nextN` as the result.
In this case, the input `N` is 35.
The square root of 35 is approximately 5.92, which rounds down to 5.
Adding 1 to 5 gives us 6.
The square of 6 is 36.
Therefore, the return value of `next_Perfect_Square(35)` is 36.
<<<Output>>>
36
