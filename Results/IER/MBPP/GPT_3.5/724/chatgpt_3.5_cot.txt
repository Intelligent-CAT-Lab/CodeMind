<<<Analysis>>>
The function `power_base_sum` takes two parameters: `base` and `power`.
It calculates the value of `base` raised to the power of `power` using the `pow` function.
The result of `pow(base, power)` is converted to a string using `str`.
The string is then converted to a list of individual characters using a list comprehension: `[int(i) for i in str(pow(base, power))]`.
Each character in the list is converted to an integer using `int`.
Finally, the sum of all the integers in the list is calculated using the `sum` function.
The result of this calculation is the return value of the function.
In this case, `base` is 2 and `power` is 100.
So, `pow(base, power)` is 2^100, which is a very large number.
The individual digits of this number are then summed up, resulting in the return value.
