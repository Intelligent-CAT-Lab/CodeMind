<<<Analysis>>>
The function `volume_cube` takes a single input parameter `l`, which is an integer.
The function calculates the volume of a cube by multiplying the length `l` by itself three times, i.e. `l * l * l`.
The calculated volume is stored in the variable `volume`.
The function then returns the value of the `volume` variable.
