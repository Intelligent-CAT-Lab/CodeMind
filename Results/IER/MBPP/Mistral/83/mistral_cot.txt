 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_Char` takes a string `strr` as input.
It initializes a variable `summ` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the string.
For each character in the string, it calculates its ASCII value and subtracts the ASCII value of 'a' (which is 97) to get the position of the character in the alphabet.
It then adds 1 to this position to get the position of the character in the alphabet plus 1.
The code then checks if the sum of the ASCII values of all characters in the string is divisible by 26. If it is, it returns the ASCII value of 'z' (which is 122).
If it is not, it calculates the remainder of the sum divided by 26 and returns the ASCII value of 'a' plus the remainder minus 1.
For the input "abc", the sum of the ASCII values of the characters is 97 + 98 + 100 = 295.
Since 295 is not divisible by 26, the remainder is calculated as 295 % 26 = 13.
The ASCII value of 'a' plus 13 minus 1 is 116, which is the ASCII value of 'j'.
Therefore, the return value of `get_Char("abc")` is 'j'.
