 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the string as a substring of itself.
The function first concatenates the string with itself to create a longer string "tmp".
It then iterates over all possible substrings of "tmp" using a for loop that starts at index 1 and ends at n+1 (where n is the length of the original string).
For each substring, it checks if it is equal to the original string. If it is, it returns the index of the substring.
If no matching substring is found, it returns n (the length of the original string).
