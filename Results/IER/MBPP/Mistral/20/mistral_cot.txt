<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_woodall` takes an integer `x` as input.
The function first checks if `x` is even by using the modulo operator `%`. If `x` is even, the function returns `False`.
If `x` is 1, the function returns `True`.
If `x` is not even and not 1, the function enters a while loop that repeatedly divides `x` by 2 and increments `p` until `x` becomes 1 or `p` becomes equal to `x`.
If `p` becomes equal to `x`, the function returns `True`.
If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `False`.
<<<Output>>>
False
