 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sequence` takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer.
The function first checks if `n` is equal to 1 or 2. If it is, it returns 1.
Otherwise, it recursively calls itself twice with the arguments `n-1` and `n-sequence(n-1)`. The return value of the first recursive call is added to the return value of the second recursive call.
The recursion continues until `n` is equal to 1 or 2, at which point the function returns 1.
