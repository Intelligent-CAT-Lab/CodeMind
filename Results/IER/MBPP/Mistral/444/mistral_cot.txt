 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: test\_list, which is a list of tuples, and K, which is an integer.
The function initializes an empty list called res, which will be used to store the trimmed tuples.
The function then iterates over each tuple in test\_list.
For each tuple, it calculates the length of the tuple using the len() function and stores it in the variable N.
It then uses the slice notation to extract the Kth element to the N-Kth element of the tuple, effectively trimming the tuple to the desired length.
The resulting trimmed tuple is then appended to the res list.
After the loop finishes, the function converts the res list to a string using the str() function and returns it.
<<<Output>>>
[('(5, 3)', '(3, 4)', '(9, 1)', '(4, 8)')]
