<<<Analysis>>>
The function `common_element` takes two lists as input, `list1` and `list2`. It initializes a variable `result` to `False`.
It then enters two nested loops that iterate over each element in `list1` and `list2`, respectively.
For each element `x` in `list1` and `y` in `list2`, it checks if `x` is equal to `y`. If it is, it sets `result` to `True` and returns `result`.
After the loops finish, if no common element is found, `result` remains `False` and the function returns `False`.
<<<Output>>>
False
