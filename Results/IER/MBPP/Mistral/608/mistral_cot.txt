 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `bell_Number` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the value of the `n`th Bell number.
The Bell number is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 1.
The function initializes a 2D array `bell` with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)` and fills it with zeros.
It then sets the value of `bell[0][0]` to 1, which is the first Bell number.
The function then enters two nested loops that iterate over the rows and columns of the `bell` array, respectively.
For each row `i`, it sets the value of `bell[i][0]` to the value of `bell[i-1][i-1]`, which is the value of the previous Bell number.
For each column `j`, it sets the value of `bell[i][j]` to the sum of the values of `bell[i-1][j-1]` and `bell[i][j-1]`, which are the values of the two preceding Bell numbers.
Finally, the function returns the value of `bell[n][0]`, which is the `n`th Bell number.
