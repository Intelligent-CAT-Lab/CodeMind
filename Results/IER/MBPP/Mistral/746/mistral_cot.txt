 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sector_area` takes two arguments: `r` and `a`. `r` is the radius of the circle and `a` is the angle in degrees.
The function first checks if `a` is greater than 360 degrees. If it is, the function returns `None`.
If `a` is less than or equal to 360 degrees, the function calculates the area of the sector using the formula `(pi*r**2)*(a/360)` and returns the result.
In this case, `r` is 4 and `a` is 45.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the function `sector_area(4,45)` is 1.0471975544709332.
