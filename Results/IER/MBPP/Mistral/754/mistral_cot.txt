 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_index_list` takes three lists as input: `l1`, `l2`, and `l3`. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the indices that appear in all three lists.
The code then uses the `zip` function to iterate over the three lists simultaneously. For each tuple `(m, n, o)` returned by `zip`, it checks if all three elements are equal. If they are, it appends the value of `m` to the `result` list.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the `result` list.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
