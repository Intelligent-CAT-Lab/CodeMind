 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_sum` takes an array `arr` as input.
The first part of the function initializes two arrays, `MSIBS` and `MSDBS`, which are copies of the input array `arr`.
The function then iterates through the input array `arr` and for each element, it checks if it can be added to a previous element in `MSIBS` to form a larger sum. If it can, it updates the value of the current element in `MSIBS`.
The second part of the function does the same thing, but it iterates through the input array `arr` in reverse order and updates the value of the current element in `MSDBS`.
The function then calculates the maximum sum that can be formed by adding elements from `MSIBS` and `MSDBS` in any order. It does this by iterating through the two arrays and for each pair of elements, it calculates the sum of the two elements and subtracts the sum of the two elements in the other array.
Finally, the function returns the maximum sum that can be formed.
For the input `[1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]`, the function first initializes `MSIBS` and `MSDBS` to be copies of the input array.
It then iterates through the input array and updates the values of `MSIBS` to form the largest sum possible. The largest sum that can be formed is 100, which is achieved by adding 15 to 51.
The function then iterates through the input array in reverse order and updates the values of `MSDBS` to form the largest sum possible. The largest sum that can be formed is 100, which is achieved by adding 15 to 51.
The function then calculates the maximum sum that can be formed by adding elements from `MSIBS` and `MSDBS` in any order. The maximum sum that can be formed is 100, which is achieved by adding 15 to 51.
Finally, the function returns 100.
