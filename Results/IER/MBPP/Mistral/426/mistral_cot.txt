<<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_oddnumbers` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the input list.
The function uses the built-in `filter` function, which applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to produce a new list containing all elements for which the function returns True.
In this case, the lambda function passed to `filter` checks if the remainder of the number when divided by 2 is not equal to 0, which means the number is odd.
The function then converts the filtered list to a list using the built-in `list` function and returns it.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
