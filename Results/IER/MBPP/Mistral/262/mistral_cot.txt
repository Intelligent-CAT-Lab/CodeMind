 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `split_two_parts` takes two arguments: `list1` and `L`. `list1` is a list of integers and `L` is an integer representing the length of the first part of the split list.
The function returns two lists: the first part of the split list and the second part of the split list.
The function uses slicing to split the list into two parts. The first part of the split list is obtained using the slice `list1[:L]`, which returns all elements of the list up to (but not including) the index L. The second part of the split list is obtained using the slice `list1[L:]`, which returns all elements of the list starting from index L.
For the given input `[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1]` and `L=3`, the function will return two lists: `[1, 1, 2]` and `[3, 4, 5, 1]`.
<<<Output>>>
([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5, 1])
