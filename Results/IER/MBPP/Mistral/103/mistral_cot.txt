 <<<Analysis>>>
The function eulerian_num takes two arguments, n and m.
The function first checks if m is greater than or equal to n, or if n is equal to 0. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns 0.
If m is equal to 0, the function returns 1.
Otherwise, the function calculates the Eulerian number using the recurrence relation:
E(n, m) = (n - m) * E(n - 1, m - 1) + (m + 1) * E(n - 1, m)
The function calls itself recursively with n - 1 and m - 1, and n - 1 and m, and adds the results together.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of eulerian_num(3, 1) is 4.
