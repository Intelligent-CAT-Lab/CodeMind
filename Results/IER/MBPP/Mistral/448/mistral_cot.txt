 <<<Analysis>>>
The function cal_sum takes an integer n as input.
The function initializes three variables a, b and c with values 3, 0 and 2 respectively.
The function then checks if n is equal to 0, 1 or 2. If it is, it returns 3.
If n is not equal to 0, 1 or 2, the function enters a while loop that continues until n is less than or equal to 2.
Inside the loop, the function calculates the sum of the digits of n and adds it to the variable sum.
The function then updates the values of a, b and c using a series of assignments.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of sum.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of cal_sum(9) is 24.
