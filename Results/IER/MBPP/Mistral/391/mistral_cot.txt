 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `convert_list_dictionary` takes three input lists: `l1`, `l2`, and `l3`. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over the three lists simultaneously, and for each tuple `(x, y, z)` in the zip, it creates a dictionary with keys `x`, `y`, and `z`, and values `{x: {y: z}}`.
The resulting dictionaries are then stored in a list of dictionaries, which is returned by the function.
