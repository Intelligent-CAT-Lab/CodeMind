 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes an array as input and initializes two variables, i and sum, to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the array, starting from index 0 and incrementing by 2 at each iteration. This means that the loop will consider every second element of the array, starting with the first element.
For each element, the code checks if it is even by using the modulo operator (%). If the element is even, it is added to the sum variable.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of the sum variable, which is 30.
<<<Output>>>
30
