 <<<Analysis>>>
The function divisor takes an integer n as input.
It initializes a variable x to 0, which will be used to store the number of divisors of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of divisors of n that are less than or equal to i. This is done by creating a list of numbers from 1 to n and then filtering out the numbers that are not divisible by i. The length of this filtered list is the number of divisors of n that are less than or equal to i.
The code then adds the number of divisors of n that are less than or equal to i to x.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of x, which is the total number of divisors of n.
