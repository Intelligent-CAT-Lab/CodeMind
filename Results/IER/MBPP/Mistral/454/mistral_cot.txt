 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `text_match_wordz` takes a string `text` as input.
It uses regular expressions to define a pattern that matches any sequence of word characters (letters, digits, or underscores) followed by the letter "z" and then any sequence of word characters again.
The function uses the `re.search()` function to search for this pattern in the input text. If the pattern is found, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
