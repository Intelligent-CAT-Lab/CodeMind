 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_nested` takes a tuple as input and returns a new tuple with all nested tuples removed.
The function first initializes an empty tuple called `res`.
It then iterates over each element in the input tuple using the `enumerate` function, which returns a tuple containing the index and value of each element.
For each element, it checks if it is a tuple using the `isinstance` function. If it is not a tuple, it adds the element to the `res` tuple.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the `res` tuple.
<<<Output>>>
