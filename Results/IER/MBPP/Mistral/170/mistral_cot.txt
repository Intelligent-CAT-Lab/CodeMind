 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_range_list` takes three arguments: `list1`, `m`, and `n`. `list1` is a list of integers, `m` is the starting index of the range to sum, and `n` is the ending index of the range to sum.
The variable `sum_range` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers in the specified range.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from `m` to `n` (inclusive), meaning it will consider all elements in the specified range.
For each element in the range, it adds it to the `sum_range` variable.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `sum_range`, which is the sum of all elements in the specified range.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `sum_range_list([2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12], 8, 10)` is 55.
