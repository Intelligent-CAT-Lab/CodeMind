<<<Analysis>>>
The function `reverse_words` takes a string `s` as input.
The first line of the function uses the `split()` method to split the string `s` into a list of words using spaces as the delimiter.
The second line of the function uses the `reversed()` function to reverse the order of the elements in the list of words.
The third line of the function uses the `join()` method to join the reversed list of words back into a string, with spaces as the delimiter.
The final return value of the function is the reversed string.
