<<<Analysis>>>
The function `radian_degree` takes a single argument `degree`, which is an integer.
The function first calculates the value of `radian` by multiplying the `degree` by the value of `math.pi/180`.
The value of `math.pi/180` is approximately 0.0174532925199432957.
So, the value of `radian` is calculated as `degree * 0.0174532925199432957`.
The function then returns the value of `radian`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `radian_degree(90)` is approximately 1.5707950946099684.
