 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_occurance` takes a string `s` as input.
It initializes a variable `count` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of occurrences of the substring "std".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the index 0 to the length of the string `s` minus 2.
For each index `i` in this range, it checks if the substring "std" (consisting of the characters at index `i`, `i+1` and `i+2`) is present in the string `s`. If it is, it increments the count variable.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of count, which is 3.
