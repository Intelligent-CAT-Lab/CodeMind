 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_digits` takes an integer `n` as input.
The function first checks if `n` is equal to 0. If it is, the function returns 0.
Otherwise, the function calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, which gives the last digit of `n`. It then recursively calls itself with the integer `n / 10` as input, which removes the last digit from `n`.
The function then adds the last digit to the result of the recursive call.
For example, when `n` is 345, the function first calculates `n % 10`, which is 5. It then recursively calls itself with `n / 10`, which is 34. The function then adds 5 to the result of the recursive call, which is 39.
<<<Output>>>
39
