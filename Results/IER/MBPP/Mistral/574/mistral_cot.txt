 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `surfacearea_cylinder` takes two arguments, `r` and `h`, which represent the radius and height of a cylinder, respectively.
The function calculates the surface area of the cylinder using the formula:
2πr^2 + 2πrh
where π is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.1415.
The formula is implemented in the function by first calculating the value of 2πr^2 and 2πrh separately, and then adding them together.
The final result is stored in the variable `surfacearea`.
The function then returns the value of `surfacearea`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `surfacearea_cylinder(10,5)` is 628.3185307179586.
