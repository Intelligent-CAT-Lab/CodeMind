 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and initializes a variable upper_ctr to 0.
It then iterates through each character in the string using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if it is an uppercase letter using the condition str[i] >= 'A' and str[i] <= 'Z'. If it is, it increments the upper_ctr variable by 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of upper_ctr.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `upper_ctr('PYthon')` is 3.
