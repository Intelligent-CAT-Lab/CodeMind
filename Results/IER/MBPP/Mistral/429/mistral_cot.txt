 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `and_tuples` takes two tuples as input, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. It uses a generator expression to create a new tuple `res` where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements of the two input tuples. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the elements of the two input tuples simultaneously.
The function returns the new tuple `res`.
<<<Output>>>
((2, 2, 2, 2),)
