 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `index_minimum` takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains a string and an integer.
The function uses the `min` function to find the minimum value in the list of tuples. The `key` argument of the `min` function is set to `itemgetter(1)`, which means that the function will use the second element of each tuple (the integer) to compare the tuples.
The `min` function returns a tuple containing the minimum value and its index. The function then extracts the minimum value (which is the integer) and returns it.
