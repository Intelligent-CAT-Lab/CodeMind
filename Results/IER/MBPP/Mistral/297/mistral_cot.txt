 <<<Analysis>>>
The function flatten_list takes a list as input and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the original list, including any nested lists.
The function first checks if the input list is empty, and if so, it returns an empty list.
Otherwise, it initializes an empty list called result_list, which will be used to store the flattened list.
It then creates a stack and adds the input list to it.
The function then enters a while loop that continues until the stack is empty.
Inside the loop, it pops the top element from the stack and checks if it is a list.
If it is, it checks if the list is not empty, and if so, it adds the list to the stack.
If the list is empty, it pops the next element from the list and checks if it is a list.
If it is, it adds the list to the stack.
If the list is not empty, it pops the next element from the list and appends it to the result_list.
After the loop finishes, the function reverses the order of the elements in the result_list and returns it.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
