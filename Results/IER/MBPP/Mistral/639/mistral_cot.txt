 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sample_nam` takes a list of strings as input. It first converts the list to a list of tuples using the `filter` function. The `filter` function applies a lambda function to each element of the list and returns a new list containing only the elements for which the lambda function returns `True`.
The lambda function checks if the first letter of the string is uppercase and the rest of the string is lowercase. If this condition is met, the element is added to the new list.
The function then concatenates all the elements of the new list using the `join` method and returns the length of the resulting string.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `sample_nam(['sally', 'Dylan', 'rebecca', 'Diana', 'Joanne', 'keith'])` is 16.
The filtered list is `['Diana', 'Joanne']` and the length of the resulting string is 16.
