 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes in four arguments: a list of integers a, the length of the list n, an index i, and a value k.
The function initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions n x n, which will be used to store the maximum sum of increasing subsequences of length k.
The function then iterates through the list a and initializes the first row of dp with the values a[i] + a[0] for all i in range(n), and a[i] for all i in range(n) except for i = 0.
The function then iterates through the remaining rows of dp, using dynamic programming to calculate the maximum sum of increasing subsequences of length k for each pair of indices i and j.
The function checks if a[j] > a[i] and j > i, and if so, it checks if the maximum sum of increasing subsequence of length k ending at index i plus a[j] is greater than the maximum sum of increasing subsequence of length k ending at index j. If it is, it sets dp[i][j] to dp[i - 1][i] + a[j]. Otherwise, it sets dp[i][j] to dp[i - 1][j].
The function then returns the value at dp[index][k], which is the maximum sum of increasing subsequence of length k ending at index k.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5 ], 7, 4, 6)` is 231.
