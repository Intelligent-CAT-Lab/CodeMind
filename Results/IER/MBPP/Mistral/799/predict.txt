The return value of left_rotate(16,2) is 128.

Here's how the function works:

* The value of n is 16, which is 10000 in binary.
* The value of d is 2, which is 0001 in binary.
* The left-rotation operation shifts the bits of 10000 to the left by 2 positions, resulting in 110000.
* The bits that are shifted out of the leftmost position (0) are appended to the rightmost position of the result (110000), resulting in 1100000.
* The result of the left-rotation operation is 128.

Therefore, the return value of left_rotate(16,2) is 128.
