<<<Analysis>>>
The function left_rotate takes two arguments: n and d. n is an integer and d is an integer.
The function first defines a constant INT_BITS, which is set to 32.
The function then uses bitwise operations to left-rotate the value of n by d bits.
The left-rotation operation is performed by shifting the bits of n to the left by d positions. The bits that are shifted out of the leftmost position are appended to the rightmost position of the result.
The function returns the result of the left-rotation operation.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of left_rotate(16,2) is 128.

Here's how the function works:

* The value of n is 16, which is 10000 in binary.
* The value of d is 2, which is 0001 in binary.
* The left-rotation operation shifts the bits of 10000 to the left by 2 positions, resulting in 110000.
* The bits that are shifted out of the leftmost position (0) are appended to the rightmost position of the result (110000), resulting in 1100000.
* The result of the left-rotation operation is 128.

Therefore, the return value of left_rotate(16,2) is 128.
