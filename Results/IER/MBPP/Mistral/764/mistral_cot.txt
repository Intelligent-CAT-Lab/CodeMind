 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and initializes a variable number_ctr to 0.
It then iterates through each character in the string using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if it is a digit between 0 and 9 using an if statement.
If it is, it increments the number_ctr variable by 1.
The function then returns the final value of number_ctr.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `number_ctr('program2bedone')` is 7.
