 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `frequency_lists` takes a list as input. In this case, the input is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers.
The function first flattens the input list by using a list comprehension to iterate over all sublists and items within them. The resulting list is stored in the variable `list1`.
The function then creates an empty dictionary `dic_data`. It then iterates over each number in `list1` and checks if it exists as a key in `dic_data`. If it does, it increments the corresponding value by 1. If it doesn't, it adds the number as a key with a value of 1.
Finally, the function returns the dictionary `dic_data`, which contains the frequency of each number in the input list.
<<<Output>>>
{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}
