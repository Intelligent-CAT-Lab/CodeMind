 <<<Analysis>>>
The function list_to_float takes a list of tuples as input.
For each tuple in the list, it creates a new list called temp.
For each element in the tuple, it checks if it is a string (using the isalpha() method). If it is, it appends it to the temp list. If it is not, it converts it to a float using the float() method and appends it to the temp list.
After all elements in the tuple have been processed, the first two elements of the temp list are appended to the res list as a tuple.
The function then returns the res list.
<<<Output>>>
[('3', '4'), ('1', '26.45'), ('7.32', '8'), ('4', '8')]
