 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_Sub_Array` takes two input arrays `A` and `B` as parameters. The length of `A` is `n` and the length of `B` is `m`. The function initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to 0.
The while loop runs until `i` is less than `n` and `j` is less than `m`.
Inside the loop, the function checks if the element at index `i` of `A` is equal to the element at index `j` of `B`. If it is, it increments both `i` and `j` by 1. If `j` becomes equal to `m`, the function returns `True`, indicating that `B` is a subarray of `A`.
If the element at index `i` of `A` is not equal to the element at index `j` of `B`, the function subtracts `j` from `i` and sets `j` to 0. This means that the subarray `B` has been shifted by `j` positions to the left.
After the loop finishes, if `i` is less than `n` and `j` is less than `m`, the function returns `False`, indicating that `B` is not a subarray of `A`.
