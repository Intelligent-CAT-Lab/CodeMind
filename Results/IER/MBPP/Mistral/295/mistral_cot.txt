 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_div` takes an integer `number` as input.
It initializes a list `divisors` with the value 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `number` (inclusive).
For each number `i` in this range, it checks if `number` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator `%`. If it is, it appends `i` to the `divisors` list.
The code then returns the sum of all the numbers in the `divisors` list using the built-in `sum` function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `sum_div(8)` is 6.
The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. The sum of these numbers is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15.
