 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: arr, which is a list of integers, and n, which is an integer.
The variable mul is initialized to 1, which will be used to calculate the remainder.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list arr.
For each element in the list, it multiplies mul by the remainder of the element divided by n, and then takes the remainder of the result.
The final value of mul is returned as the remainder.
