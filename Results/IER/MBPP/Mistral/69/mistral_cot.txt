 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_sublist` takes two arguments: `l` and `s`. `l` is a list and `s` is a sublist of `l`. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether `s` is a sublist of `l`.
The function first checks if `s` is an empty list. If it is, then `s` is a sublist of `l` and the function returns `True`.
If `s` is not an empty list, the function checks if `s` is equal to `l`. If it is, then `s` is a sublist of `l` and the function returns `True`.
If `s` is not an empty list and not equal to `l`, the function checks if the length of `s` is greater than the length of `l`. If it is, then `s` cannot be a sublist of `l` and the function returns `False`.
If the length of `s` is less than the length of `l`, the function checks if `s` is a sublist of `l` by iterating over the elements of `l` and checking if each element matches the corresponding element of `s`. If a match is found, the function continues to check the next element of `s` until it reaches the end of `s`. If all elements of `s` are found in `l`, then `s` is a sublist of `l` and the function returns `True`.
In this case, `l` is `[2,4,3,5,7]` and `s` is `[3,7]`. The length of `s` is 2, which is less than the length of `l`, which is 5. The function then checks if `s` is a sublist of `l` by iterating over the elements of `l` and checking if each element matches the corresponding element of `s`. The first element of `s` is `3`, which is not equal to the first element of `l`, which is `2`. The function continues to check the next element of `s`, which is `7`, and finds a match with the second element of `l`, which is `4`. The function then continues to check the next element of `s`, which is not found in `l`, so the function returns `False`.
