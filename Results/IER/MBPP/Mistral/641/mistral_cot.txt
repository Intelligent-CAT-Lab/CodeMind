<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_nonagonal` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value.
The function calculates the value of `n * (7 * n - 5) / 2` and checks if it is an integer. If it is, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.
The formula `n * (7 * n - 5) / 2` is used to check if a number is nonagonal. A nonagonal number is a number that is not a square or a rectangle.
The formula works by checking if the number is divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. If it is divisible by 2, it is a rectangle. If it is divisible by 3, it is a triangle. If it is divisible by 5, it is a pentagon. If it is divisible by 7, it is a heptagon. If it is divisible by 2 and 3, it is a rectangle. If it is divisible by 2 and 5, it is a rectangle. If it is divisible by 2 and 7, it is a rectangle. If it is divisible by 3 and 5, it is a rectangle. If it is divisible by 3 and 7, it is a rectangle. If it is divisible by 5 and 7, it is a rectangle. If it is divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7, it is a rectangle.
