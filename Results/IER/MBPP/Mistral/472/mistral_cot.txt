 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_Consecutive` takes a list `l` as input.
The function first sorts the list using the `sorted()` function.
Then it checks if the sorted list is equal to the list obtained by converting the range of integers from the minimum value of the list to the maximum value of the list plus one, using the `list()` function.
If the two lists are equal, it means that the numbers in the list are consecutive, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
