 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `shell_sort` takes a list `my_list` as input.
The variable `gap` is initialized to the length of the list divided by 2.
The function enters a while loop that continues until `gap` is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, there is another for loop that iterates from `gap` to the end of the list (inclusive).
For each iteration of the inner loop, it compares the current item `current_item` with the item at index `j - gap`.
If `current_item` is smaller than the item at index `j - gap`, it swaps the two items.
It continues swapping items until `j` is less than or equal to `gap` or the item at index `j - gap` is greater than or equal to `current_item`.
After the inner loop finishes, it swaps the item at index `j` with `current_item`.
After the while loop finishes, the function returns the sorted list.
