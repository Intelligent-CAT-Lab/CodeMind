 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_Monotonic` takes a list A as input. It checks if the list is monotonic, meaning that all elements are either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.
The function uses two `all` statements to check this condition. The first `all` statement checks if all elements in the list are less than or equal to the next element. The second `all` statement checks if all elements in the list are greater than or equal to the next element.
If either of these conditions is not met, the function returns False. If both conditions are met, the function returns True.
<<<Output>>>
False
