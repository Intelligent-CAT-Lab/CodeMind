 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes four arguments:
- arr: a list of integers
- ranges: a list of lists, where each inner list represents a range of indices in the array
- rotations: an integer representing the number of rotations to apply to the array
- index: an integer representing the index of the element to find
The function first iterates over the ranges in reverse order, starting from the last range. For each range, it checks if the left index of the range is less than or equal to the index and the right index is greater than or equal to the index. If this condition is met, it checks if the index is equal to the left index of the range. If it is, it sets the index to the right index of the range. If it is not, it sets the index to the index minus one.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the element at the final index.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the function `find_Element([1,2,3,4,5],[[0,2],[0,3]],2,1)` is 3.
The function first iterates over the ranges in reverse order, starting from the last range. The first range is [0,2], which means that the elements at indices 0 and 1 are swapped. The second range is [0,3], which means that the elements at indices 0 and 2 are swapped. After applying these two rotations, the array becomes [5,1,2,3,4]. The index to find is 1, which corresponds to the element 2 in the original array. Since the element at index 1 in the original array is 2, the function returns 2. However, since the array has been rotated twice, the element at index 1 in the rotated array is 3. Therefore, the return value of the function is 3.
