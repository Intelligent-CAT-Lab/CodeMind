The return value of the function `find_Element([1,2,3,4,5],[[0,2],[0,3]],2,1)` is 3.
The function first iterates over the ranges in reverse order, starting from the last range. The first range is [0,2], which means that the elements at indices 0 and 1 are swapped. The second range is [0,3], which means that the elements at indices 0 and 2 are swapped. After applying these two rotations, the array becomes [5,1,2,3,4]. The index to find is 1, which corresponds to the element 2 in the original array. Since the element at index 1 in the original array is 2, the function returns 2. However, since the array has been rotated twice, the element at index 1 in the rotated array is 3. Therefore, the return value of the function is 3.
