The function `string_to_tuple` takes a string as input and returns a tuple.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string and only keep the characters that are not spaces. The resulting list is then converted to a tuple using the `tuple()` function.
The function is called with the input string "python 3.0".
<<<Output>>>
