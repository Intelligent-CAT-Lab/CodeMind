 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `neg_nos` takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the negative numbers from the input list.
The code first initializes an empty list called `out`.
Then it iterates over each number in the input list `list1` using a for loop.
For each number, it checks if it is less than 0 using an if statement. If it is, it appends the number to the `out` list using the `append` method.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the `out` list.
<<<Output>>>
[-1, -6]
