 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `move_zero` takes a list `num_list` as input.
It first creates a new list `a` of length equal to the number of zeros in `num_list`.
It then creates a new list `x` containing all the elements of `num_list` that are not zero.
Finally, it returns the concatenation of `x` and `a`.
For the input `[1,0,2,0,3,4]`, the function will first count the number of zeros, which is 2. It will then create a list `a` of length 2, which will contain only zeros.
It will then create a new list `x` containing all the elements of `num_list` that are not zero, which is `[1,2,3,4]`.
Finally, it will return the concatenation of `x` and `a`, which is `[1,2,3,4,0,0]`.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0]
