 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `round_and_sum` takes a list as input.
It first calculates the length of the list using the `len()` function and stores it in the variable `lenght`.
It then uses the `map()` function to apply the `round()` function to each element of the list. The `map()` function returns an iterator that applies a function to each element of an iterable, so in this case it applies the `round()` function to each element of the list.
The resulting list of rounded values is then passed to the `sum()` function, which calculates the sum of all the elements in the list.
The resulting sum is then multiplied by the length of the list and stored in the variable `round_and_sum`.
Finally, the function returns the value of `round_and_sum`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `round_and_sum([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50])` is 100.0.
