 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: arr, which is a list of integers, and x, which is an integer.
The variable n is set to the length of the list arr.
The variables low and high are initialized to 0 and n-1, respectively.
The variable res is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the index of the last occurrence of x in the list.
The code enters a while loop that continues until low is greater than high.
Inside the loop, the mid index is calculated as the average of low and high.
The code then checks if the element at the mid index is greater than x. If it is, the high index is updated to mid-1.
If the element at the mid index is less than x, the low index is updated to mid+1.
If the element at the mid index is equal to x, the index of the last occurrence of x in the list is stored in res and the low index is updated to mid+1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of res.
