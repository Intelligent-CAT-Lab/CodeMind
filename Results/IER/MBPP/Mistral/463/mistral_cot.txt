 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_subarray_product` takes an array `arr` as input.
The variable `n` is initialized to the length of the array.
The variables `max_ending_here`, `min_ending_here` and `max_so_far` are initialized to 1, 1 and 0, respectively.
The variable `flag` is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each element in the array, it checks if the element is positive, negative or zero.
If the element is positive, it multiplies the current maximum ending here by the element and updates the minimum ending here to the minimum of the current minimum ending here and 1. It also sets the flag to 1.
If the element is negative, it updates the maximum ending here to the maximum of the current minimum ending here and 1 and updates the minimum ending here to the current minimum ending here multiplied by the element.
If the element is zero, it updates the maximum ending here and minimum ending here to 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the maximum so far is less than the maximum ending here. If it is, it updates the maximum so far to the maximum ending here.
If the flag is 0 and the maximum so far is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the maximum so far.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `max_subarray_product([1, -2, -3, 0, 7, -8, -2])` is 14.
