 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_rotation` takes an array `arr` as input.
The function iterates over the array starting from the second element (index 1) to the end.
For each element, it checks if the current element is smaller than the previous element. If it is, it means that the array has rotated and the current element is the first element of the rotated array.
The function returns the index of the first element of the rotated array.
In the case of the input `[3,2,1]`, the array is already rotated and the first element is the smallest element. Therefore, the function returns 0.
