 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the cmath module, which provides complex number operations.
The function polar\_rect takes two arguments, x and y, which are used to create a complex number cn using the complex() function.
The cn is then converted to polar coordinates using the cmath.polar() function, which returns a tuple of the magnitude and phase of the complex number.
The magnitude and phase of the complex number are then used to create a new complex number cn1 using the cmath.rect() function, which takes two arguments: the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the polar coordinates of cn and the rectangular coordinates of cn1.
<<<Output>>>
(3.0+4.0j, (2.0+0.0j))
