 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_sub_array_sum_repeated` takes three arguments: `a`, `n`, and `k`.
`a` is a list of integers representing the input array.
`n` is the length of the input array.
`k` is the number of times the input array is repeated.
The function initializes two variables: `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
`max_so_far` is initialized to -2147483648, which is the minimum possible value for an integer.
`max_ending_here` is initialized to 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates `n*k` times.
For each iteration, it adds the current element of the input array to `max_ending_here`.
It then checks if `max_so_far` is less than `max_ending_here`. If it is, it updates `max_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.
It also checks if `max_ending_here` is less than 0. If it is, it sets `max_ending_here` to 0.
After the loop finishes, the function returns `max_so_far`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `max_sub_array_sum_repeated([10, 20, -30, -1], 4, 3)` is 70.
This is because the maximum sum of a subarray of length 3 in the repeated array is 70.
The subarray is [10, 20, -30] with a sum of 40.
Then, the subarray is [20, -30, -1] with a sum of 1.
Finally, the subarray is [-30, -1, 10] with a sum of 10.
The sum of these three subarrays is 70.
