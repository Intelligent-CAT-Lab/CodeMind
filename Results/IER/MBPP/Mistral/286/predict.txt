The return value of `max_sub_array_sum_repeated([10, 20, -30, -1], 4, 3)` is 70.
This is because the maximum sum of a subarray of length 3 in the repeated array is 70.
The subarray is [10, 20, -30] with a sum of 40.
Then, the subarray is [20, -30, -1] with a sum of 1.
Finally, the subarray is [-30, -1, 10] with a sum of 10.
The sum of these three subarrays is 70.
