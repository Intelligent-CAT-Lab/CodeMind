<<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_elements` takes two arguments, `list1` and `list2`. It returns a new list that contains all the elements of `list1` that are not in `list2`.
The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the elements of `list1` that are not in `list2`. The list comprehension iterates over each element `x` in `list1` and checks if `x` is not in `list2` using the `not in` operator. If `x` is not in `list2`, it is added to the new list `result`.
The final return value of the function is the new list `result`.
