 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_Occ` takes two arguments: `s` and `ch`. `s` is a string and `ch` is a character.
The function first iterates through the string `s` from left to right using a for loop. For each character in the string, it checks if it is equal to the character `ch`. If it is, it removes that character from the string using string slicing and breaks out of the loop.
After the first loop, the function iterates through the string `s` from right to left using another for loop. For each character in the string, it checks if it is equal to the character `ch`. If it is, it removes that character from the string using string slicing and breaks out of the loop.
Finally, the function returns the modified string `s`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `remove_Occ("hello","l")` is "heo".
