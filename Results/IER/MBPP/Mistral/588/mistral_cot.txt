<<<Analysis>>>
The function `big_diff` takes a list of integers as input.
It first calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list using the `max()` and `min()` functions.
It then returns the result of this calculation.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `big_diff([1,2,3,4])` is 2.
The maximum value in the list is 4 and the minimum value is 1, so the difference is 4-1=3.
