 <<<Analysis>>>
The function jacobsthal\_num takes an integer n as input and returns the value of the Jacobi symbol of n.
The Jacobi symbol of n is defined as the sum of the products of n and all its positive divisors, excluding n itself.
The function uses dynamic programming to compute the Jacobi symbol of n.
It initializes an array dp of length n+1 with all elements set to 0.
It sets dp[0] to 0 and dp[1] to 1, which are the base cases for the Jacobi symbol.
It then iterates over the range 2 to n, computing dp[i] as the sum of dp[i-1] and 2*dp[i-2].
The final value of dp[n] is the Jacobi symbol of n.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of jacobsthal\_num(5) is 4.
The Jacobi symbol of 5 is 4, which is the sum of the products of 5 and its positive divisors, excluding 5 itself.
The positive divisors of 5 are 1 and 5, and their product is 5.
Therefore, the Jacobi symbol of 5 is 4.
