 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `recursive_list_sum` takes a list as input and returns the sum of all elements in the list.
The function first initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of elements.
The function then iterates over each element in the input list.
If the element is a list, the function calls itself recursively with the element as input and adds the result to the `total`.
If the element is not a list, the function simply adds the element to the `total`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `total`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `recursive_list_sum(([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]])` is 15.
