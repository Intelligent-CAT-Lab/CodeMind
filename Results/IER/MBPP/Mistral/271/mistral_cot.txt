<<<Analysis>>>
The function `even_Power_Sum` takes an integer `n` as input.
It initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the cube of 2*i and adds it to sum.
The condition is met when i is 1 and 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
