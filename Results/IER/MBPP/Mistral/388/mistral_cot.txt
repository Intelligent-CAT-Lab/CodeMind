 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `highest_Power_of_2` takes an integer `n` as input.
The variable `res` is initialized to 0 and will be used to store the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from n to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 10 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is a power of 2 by checking if ((i & (i - 1)) == 0). If it is, it updates the value of res to i and breaks out of the loop.
The condition is met when i is 2^7, which is 128.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of res, which is 128.
<<<Output>>>
128
