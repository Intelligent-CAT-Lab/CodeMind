 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `dog_age` takes an input `h_age` and returns the dog's age based on the human age.
The function first checks if the human age is less than 0, in which case it exits the function.
If the human age is less than or equal to 2, the function calculates the dog's age as 10.5 times the human age.
If the human age is greater than 2, the function calculates the dog's age as 21 plus 4 times the difference between the human age and 2.
For the input `h_age = 12`, the function first checks if the human age is less than 0, which is not the case, so it moves to the next condition.
Since the human age is less than or equal to 2, the function calculates the dog's age as 10.5 times 12, which is 126.
Therefore, the return value of the function `dog_age(12)` is 126.
