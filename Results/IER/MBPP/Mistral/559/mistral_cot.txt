 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_sub_array_sum` takes two arguments: `a` which is a list of integers and `size` which is the number of integers in the list.
The function initializes two variables: `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`. `max_so_far` is initialized to 0 and will be used to keep track of the maximum sum of a subarray seen so far. `max_ending_here` is also initialized to 0 and will be used to keep track of the maximum sum of a subarray ending at the current index.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to size (inclusive), meaning it will consider all elements in the list.
For each element in the list, it adds the element to `max_ending_here`. If `max_ending_here` becomes negative, it is set to 0.
After that, it checks if `max_ending_here` is greater than `max_so_far`. If it is, it updates the value of `max_so_far` to `max_ending_here`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of `max_so_far`, which is the maximum sum of a subarray seen in the list.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `max_sub_array_sum([-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3], 8)` is 7.
The maximum sum of a subarray in this list is [4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3], which sums up to 7.
