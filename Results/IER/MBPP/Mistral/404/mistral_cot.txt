<<<Analysis>>>
The function `minimum` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`.
It checks if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. If it is, it returns `a`. Otherwise, it returns `b`.
In the case of `minimum(1,2)`, `a` is 1 and `b` is 2. Since 1 is less than or equal to 2, the function returns `a`, which is 1.
