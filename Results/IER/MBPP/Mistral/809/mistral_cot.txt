 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_smaller` takes two tuples as input, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over the corresponding elements of the two tuples.
For each pair of elements, it checks if the first element is greater than the second element using the `all` function.
If all pairs of elements satisfy this condition, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
In this case, the function is called with the input `((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4))`.
The first tuple contains the elements (1, 2, 3) and the second tuple contains the elements (2, 3, 4).
When the function checks the first pair of elements (1, 2), it returns `True` because 1 is greater than 2.
When the function checks the second pair of elements (2, 3), it returns `True` because 2 is greater than 3.
When the function checks the third pair of elements (3, 4), it returns `False` because 3 is not greater than 4.
Since the function returns `False` for one pair of elements, it returns `False` overall.
