 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments, a and b, which are 10 and 15 respectively.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers that are common factors of a and b.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the minimum of a and b (inclusive), which is 1 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it checks if it is a common factor of a and b by checking if both a and b are divisible by i. If they are, it adds i to sum.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
