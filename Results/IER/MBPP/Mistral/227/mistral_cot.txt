 <<<Analysis>>>
The function min_of_three takes three arguments, a, b and c.
The function checks if a is less than or equal to b and c using the if statement. If it is, it assigns the value of a to the variable smallest.
If a is not less than or equal to b and c, it checks if b is less than or equal to a and c using the elif statement. If it is, it assigns the value of b to the variable smallest.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it checks if c is less than or equal to a and b using the else statement. If it is, it assigns the value of c to the variable smallest.
Finally, the function returns the value of smallest.
