 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_Set_Bits` takes an integer `n` as input.
The variable `count` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of set bits in the number.
The code enters a while loop that continues until n is 0.
Inside the loop, it uses the bitwise AND operator `&` to check if the least significant bit of n is set. If it is, it adds 1 to count.
Then it uses the right shift operator `>>=` to shift n one bit to the right, effectively removing the least significant bit.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of count, which is 1.
