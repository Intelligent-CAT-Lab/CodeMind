 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_First_Missing` takes two arguments: `array` and `start`. The `end` argument is optional and defaults to the length of the array minus one if not provided.
The function first checks if the `end` argument is `None`, and if so, sets it to the length of the array minus one.
It then checks if the `start` index is greater than the `end` index. If it is, it returns `end + 1` as the first missing number is the one after the last element in the array.
If the `start` index is not equal to the value at that index, it means that the first missing number is at the `start` index, so it returns `start`.
If the `start` index is equal to the value at that index, the function recursively calls itself with the `start` index and the `mid` index as the `end` index.
The `mid` index is calculated as the average of the `start` and `end` indices.
If the value at the `mid` index is equal to the `mid` index, it means that the first missing number is between the `start` and `mid` indices, so the function recursively calls itself with the `start` index and the `mid` index as the `end` index.
If the value at the `mid` index is not equal to the `mid` index, it means that the first missing number is between the `start` and `mid` indices, so the function recursively calls itself with the `start` index and the `mid` index as the `end` index.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the function `find_First_Missing([0,1,2,3])` is 4.
The first missing number in the array is 4, so the function returns 4.
