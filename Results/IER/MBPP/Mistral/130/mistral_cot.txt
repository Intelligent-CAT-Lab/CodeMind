<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_occurrences` takes a list of integers as input.
It uses a defaultdict to count the occurrences of each integer in the list.
The defaultdict is initialized with a default value of 0 for each integer.
The function then iterates through the list of integers and updates the count of each integer in the defaultdict.
After the loop finishes, the function finds the integer with the maximum count using the `max` function and the `key` parameter set to a lambda function that returns the value of each item in the defaultdict.
Finally, the function returns the integer with the maximum count.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `max_occurrences([2,3,8,4,7,9,8,2,6,5,1,6,1,2,3,2,4,6,9,1,2])` is 8.
