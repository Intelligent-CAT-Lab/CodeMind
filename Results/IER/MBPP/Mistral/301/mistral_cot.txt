The function `dict_depth` takes a dictionary `d` as input.
It first checks if `d` is a dictionary using the `isinstance` function. If it is, it returns 1 plus the maximum depth of its values, otherwise it returns 0.
The function recursively calls itself on each value of the dictionary using the `map` function and the `values` attribute of the dictionary.
The function stops the recursion when it reaches a dictionary with no values, which is the case for the dictionary `{'a':1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}`.
The function returns 1 plus the maximum depth of its values, which is 1 plus the maximum depth of the dictionary `{'c': {'d': {}}}`, which is 1 plus the maximum depth of the dictionary `{'d': {}}`, which is 1 plus 0, which is 1.
