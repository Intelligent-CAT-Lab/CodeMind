<<<Analysis>>>
The function `big_sum` takes a list of integers as input.
It initializes a variable `sum` to the maximum and minimum values of the list.
It returns the sum of these two values.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `big_sum([1,2,3])` would be 5.
The maximum value in the list is 3 and the minimum value is 1, so the sum of these two values is 3+1=4.
