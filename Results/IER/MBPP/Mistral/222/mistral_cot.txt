 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_type` takes a tuple as input and returns a boolean value.
The variable `res` is initialized to `True`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in the input tuple.
For each element, it checks if it is of the same type as the first element of the tuple using the `isinstance()` function.
If any element is not of the same type as the first element, the code sets `res` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of `res`.
<<<Output>>>
False
