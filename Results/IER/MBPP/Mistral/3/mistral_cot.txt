<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_not_prime` takes an integer `n` as input.
It initializes a variable `result` to `False`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers up to the square root of 2, which is 1.5.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it sets `result` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of `result`.
<<<Output>>>
True
