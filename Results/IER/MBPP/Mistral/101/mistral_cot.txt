 <<<Analysis>>>
The function kth_element takes two arguments: arr, which is a list of integers, and k, which is an integer representing the kth element of the list.
The function first calculates the length of the list n using the len() function.
It then enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to n-i-1. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n-1, while the inner loop iterates from 0 to n-i-1.
For each iteration of the inner loop, it checks if the current element arr[j] is greater than the next element arr[j+1]. If it is, it swaps the two elements using the assignment operator.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the kth element of the sorted list.
For the input [12,3,5,7,19] and k=2, the function will return the second element of the sorted list, which is 5.

5
