 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_Of_Subarray_Prod` takes an array `arr` as input.
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of subarrays.
The variable `res` is also initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current product of subarray elements.
The variable `i` is initialized to the length of the array minus 1.
The function enters a while loop that iterates from the last element of the array to the first element (inclusive).
For each element `arr[i]`, it calculates the increment of the subarray product by multiplying the current element by the current product (1 + res).
It then adds this increment to the sum `ans`.
It updates the current product `res` to be the current increment.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `ans`.
