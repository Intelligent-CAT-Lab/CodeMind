 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_median` takes three arguments: two lists `arr1` and `arr2` and an integer `n`.
The variable `i` and `j` are initialized to 0 and will be used to iterate through the two lists.
The variable `m1` and `m2` are initialized to -1 and will be used to store the two middle values of the sorted lists.
The variable `count` is initialized to 0 and will be used to keep track of the number of elements in the two lists.
The while loop runs until `count` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`.
Inside the loop, `count` is incremented by 1.
If `i` is equal to `n`, `m1` is set to `m2` and `m2` is set to the first element of `arr2`.
If `j` is equal to `n`, `m1` is set to `m2` and `m2` is set to the first element of `arr1`.
If `arr1[i]` is less than or equal to `arr2[j]`, `m1` is set to `m2` and `m2` is set to `arr1[i]`. `i` is then incremented by 1.
If `arr1[i]` is greater than `arr2[j]`, `m1` is set to `m2` and `m2` is set to `arr2[j]`. `j` is then incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the average of `m1` and `m2`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `get_median([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5)` is 20.
