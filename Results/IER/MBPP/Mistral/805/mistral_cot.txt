 <<<Analysis>>>
The function max_sum_list takes a list of lists as input. It uses the built-in Python function max() to find the maximum element in the list. The key parameter is used to specify a function of one argument to extract a comparison key from each element in the list. In this case, the key function is sum(), which means that the maximum element in the list will be the one with the highest sum of its elements.
The function returns the maximum element found in the list.
