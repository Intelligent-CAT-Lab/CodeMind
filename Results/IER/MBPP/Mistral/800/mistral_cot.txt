The function `remove_all_spaces` takes a string as input and uses regular expressions to remove all occurrences of one or more whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) from the string.
The regular expression `r'\s+'` matches one or more whitespace characters (`\s` is a shorthand for any whitespace character). The `re.sub()` function replaces all occurrences of this regular expression with an empty string (`''`), effectively removing all whitespace characters from the input string.
The function then returns the resulting string.
