 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_length_list` takes a list of lists as input.
The first line of the function uses a list comprehension to find the maximum length of any element in the input list. It does this by iterating over each element in the input list and using the `len()` function to get the length of each element. The `max()` function is then used to find the maximum value from this list of lengths.
The second line of the function uses the `max()` function again, but this time with a `key` argument. The `key` argument is a lambda function that takes an element from the input list and returns its length. This allows the `max()` function to find the element in the input list with the maximum length.
The function returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the list with the maximum length.
