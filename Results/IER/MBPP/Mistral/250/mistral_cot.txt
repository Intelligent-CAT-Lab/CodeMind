 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_X` takes two arguments: a tuple `tup` and an integer `x`.
The variable `count` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of the integer `x` in the tuple.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in the tuple `tup`.
For each element, it checks if it is equal to the integer `x`. If it is, it increments the count by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of count, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
