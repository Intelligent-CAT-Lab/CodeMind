 <<<Analysis>>>
The function pancake_sort takes a list of integers as input.
The variable arr_len is initialized to the length of the list, which is 5 in this case.
The function enters a while loop that continues until arr_len is less than or equal to 1.
Inside the loop, it finds the maximum element in the first half of the list using the index() method and stores it in mi.
Then it reverses the second half of the list using slicing and concatenates it with the first half of the list (excluding the maximum element) to obtain a new list.
The function then reverses the last half of the list using slicing and concatenates it with the first half of the list (excluding the maximum element) to obtain a new list.
Finally, it decrements arr_len by 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the sorted list.
