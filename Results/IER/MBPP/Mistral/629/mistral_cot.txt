<<<Analysis>>>
The function Split takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (%). If the number is even, it is added to the new list.
The function then returns the new list containing only the even numbers.
<<<Output>>>
