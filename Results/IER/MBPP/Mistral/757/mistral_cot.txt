 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_reverse_pairs` takes a list of strings as input. It initializes a variable `res` to 0, which will be used to store the count of reverse pairs.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over each pair of indices `(idx, idxn)` in the list.
For each pair, it checks if the string at index `idxn` is equal to the reverse of the string at index `idx`. If it is, it adds 1 to the count and updates the variable `res`.
The condition is met when the string at index `idxn` is "julia" and the string at index `idx` is "ailuj".
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of `res`, which is 1.
