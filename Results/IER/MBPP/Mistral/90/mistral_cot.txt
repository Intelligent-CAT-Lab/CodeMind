 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `len_log` takes a list of strings as input.
It initializes a variable `max` to the length of the first element in the list.
Then it iterates over the list and for each element, it checks if its length is greater than the current value of `max`. If it is, it updates the value of `max` to the length of the current element.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `max`, which is the length of the longest element in the list.
In this case, the longest element in the list is "bigdata" with 7 characters, so the function returns 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
