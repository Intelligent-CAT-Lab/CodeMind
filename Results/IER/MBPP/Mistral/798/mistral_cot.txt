 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `_sum` takes an array `arr` as input. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the elements in the array.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in the array `arr`. For each element, it adds it to the current value of `sum`.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `sum`, which is the sum of all the elements in the array.
