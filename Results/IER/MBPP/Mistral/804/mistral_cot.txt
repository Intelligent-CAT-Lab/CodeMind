 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_product_even` takes an array `arr` as input.
The function iterates through each element of the array using a for loop.
For each element, it checks if the element is even by using the bitwise AND operator `&` with 1. If the result is 0, it means the element is even and the function returns True.
If the loop completes without returning True, it means none of the elements in the array are even and the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
