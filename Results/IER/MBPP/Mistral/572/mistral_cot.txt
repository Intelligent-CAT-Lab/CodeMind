 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers that appear only once in the input list.
The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the elements of the input list that appear only once.
The list comprehension iterates over each element in the input list and checks if the count of that element in the input list is equal to 1. If it is, the element is added to the new list.
The final result is a list of two unique numbers, which are 3 and 4 in this case.
<<<Output>>>
[3, 4]
