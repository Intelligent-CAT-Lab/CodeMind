 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: arr, which is a list of integers, and n, which is the length of the list.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the xor of pairs of elements in the list.
The code then enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all pairs of elements in the list.
For each pair of elements, it calculates their xor and adds it to ans.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 27.
<<<Output>>>
27
