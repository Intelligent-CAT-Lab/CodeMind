 <<<Analysis>>>
The function first_non_repeating_character takes a string str1 as input.
It initializes two empty lists: char_order and ctr.
It then iterates through each character c in str1.
If c is already in the ctr dictionary, it increments its count by 1.
If c is not in the ctr dictionary, it adds c to the ctr dictionary with a count of 1 and appends it to the char_order list.
After the loop finishes, it iterates through the char_order list and checks if the count of each character is 1. If it is, it returns that character.
If no character has a count of 1, it returns None.
<<<Output>>>
None
