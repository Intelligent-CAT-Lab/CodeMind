 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_tuples` takes two arguments: `test_list` and `K`. `test_list` is a list of tuples, and `K` is an integer.
The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list `res` that contains all tuples in `test_list` where all elements of the tuple are divisible by `K`.
The list comprehension iterates over each tuple in `test_list` and checks if all elements of the tuple are divisible by `K` using the `all()` function. If all elements are divisible by `K`, the tuple is added to the new list `res`.
The function then returns the new list `res`.
