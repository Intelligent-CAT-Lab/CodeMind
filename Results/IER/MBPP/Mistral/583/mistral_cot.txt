The function catalan\_number takes an integer num as input and returns the nth Catalan number.
The Catalan number is a sequence of numbers that can be defined recursively as follows:
C(n) = (n+1)C(n-1) + nC(n-2)
where C(0) = 1 and C(1) = 1.
The function first checks if num is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns 1.
Otherwise, it initializes a variable res\_num to 0 and enters a loop that iterates from 0 to num-1.
For each i in this range, it calculates the Catalan number for i and num-i-1 using recursion, and adds the result to res\_num.
The formula for the Catalan number is:
C(n) = (n+1)C(n-1) + nC(n-2)
The function then returns the final value of res\_num.
