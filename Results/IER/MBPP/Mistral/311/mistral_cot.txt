 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes an integer n as input.
It first checks if n is a power of 2 by checking if n and n+1 have no common bits using the bitwise AND operator (&). If n is a power of 2, the function returns n.
If n is not a power of 2, the function initializes pos, temp and count to 0, and enters a while loop that continues until temp is 0.
Inside the loop, the function checks if temp has a 0 bit using the bitwise AND operator (&) with 1. If temp has a 0 bit, the function sets pos to count, which is the position of the left-most unset bit.
The function then increments count and shifts temp to the right by one bit using the bitwise shift-right operator (>>=).
After the loop finishes, the function returns the result of setting the left-most unset bit by performing a bitwise OR operation (|) with 1 shifted left by pos bits.
For n = 10, the left-most unset bit is the 2nd bit, which is 0001 in binary. The function returns 14, which is 1010 in binary.
