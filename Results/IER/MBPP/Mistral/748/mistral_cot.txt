 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `capital_words_spaces` takes a string `str1` as input.
It uses the `re` module to perform a regular expression search and replace operation on the string.
The regular expression `r"(\w)([A-Z])"` matches any word character (`\w`) followed by a capital letter (`[A-Z]`).
The replacement string `r"\1 \2"` replaces the matched group with the same word character followed by a space and the capital letter.
So, for the input string "Python", the regular expression will match "Py" and "tho" and replace them with "Py " and " tho ".
The final output will be "Py tho ".
<<<Output>>>
Py tho
