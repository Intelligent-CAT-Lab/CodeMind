The return value of `find_min_diff((1,5,3,19,18,25),6)` is 2.
This is because the difference between 1 and 5 is 4, which is less than 10**20. The difference between 5 and 3 is 2, which is also less than 10**20. The difference between 3 and 19 is 16, which is greater than 10**20. The difference between 19 and 18 is 1, which is less than 10**20. The difference between 18 and 25 is 7, which is less than 10**20. Therefore, the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list is 2.
