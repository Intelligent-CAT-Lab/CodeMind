 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: arr, which is a list of integers, and n, which is the length of the list.
The function first sorts the list in ascending order using the sorted() function.
It then initializes a variable diff to 10**20, which is a very large number.
The function then iterates over the list from index i to n-1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if the difference between the current element and the previous element is less than diff. If it is, it updates the value of diff to be the current element minus the previous element.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of diff.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `find_min_diff((1,5,3,19,18,25),6)` is 2.
This is because the difference between 1 and 5 is 4, which is less than 10**20. The difference between 5 and 3 is 2, which is also less than 10**20. The difference between 3 and 19 is 16, which is greater than 10**20. The difference between 19 and 18 is 1, which is less than 10**20. The difference between 18 and 25 is 7, which is less than 10**20. Therefore, the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the list is 2.
