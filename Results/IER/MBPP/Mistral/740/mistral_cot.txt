 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `tuple_to_dict` takes a tuple as input and returns a dictionary.
The function first initializes an empty dictionary `res`.
It then uses a generator expression to iterate over the tuple, taking pairs of elements at a time (i.e. every two elements).
For each pair of elements, it creates a new key-value pair in the dictionary, where the key is the first element of the pair and the value is the second element of the pair.
The generator expression is then passed to the `dict` function, which creates a new dictionary from the generator.
Finally, the function returns the resulting dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}
