 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `return_sum` takes a dictionary as input. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of values in the dictionary.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the values in the dictionary using the `values()` method. For each value, it adds it to the `sum` variable.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `sum`, which is the sum of all the values in the dictionary.
