<<<Analysis>>>
The function `unique_Element` takes an array `arr` as input.
It creates a set from the array using the `set()` function.
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements.
So, creating a set from the array removes any duplicates from it.
The function then checks if the length of the set is equal to 1.
If it is, it means that the array contains only one unique element, and the function returns `True`.
If it is not, it means that the array contains more than one unique element, and the function returns `False`.

False
