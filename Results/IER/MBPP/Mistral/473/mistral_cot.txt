 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `tuple_intersection` takes two lists as input and returns a list of tuples that are present in both lists.
The function first converts each element of the two input lists to a tuple by sorting it and then converting it back to a tuple.
It then uses the bitwise AND operator `&` to find the intersection of the two sets of tuples.
The resulting set contains only the tuples that are present in both input lists.
Finally, the function converts the resulting set back to a list and returns it.
<<<Output>>>
[(3, 4), (5, 4), (6, 5)]
