 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_integer` takes a list as input and initializes a variable `ctr` to 0.
It then iterates through each element in the list using a for loop.
For each element, it checks if it is an integer using the `isinstance()` function. If it is, it increments the value of `ctr` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of `ctr`, which is the number of integers in the list.
