 <<<Analysis>>>
The function min\_k takes two arguments: test\_list and K.
test\_list is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and an integer value.
K is an integer representing the number of elements to return from the sorted list.
The function first sorts the test\_list in ascending order based on the second element of each tuple (i.e., the integer value).
It then selects the first K elements of the sorted list using the slice notation [:K].
Finally, it returns the selected list of tuples.
