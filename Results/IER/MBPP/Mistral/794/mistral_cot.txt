 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression matching operations.
The function `text_starta_endb` takes a string `text` as input.
The variable `patterns` is set to the regular expression pattern 'a.*?b$', which matches any string that starts with 'a', followed by any number of characters (non-greedy), and ends with 'b'.
The function uses the `re.search()` function to search for the pattern in the input text.
If the pattern is found, the function returns the match object, otherwise it returns `None`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `text_starta_endb("aabbbb")` is `None`, because the input string does not match the regular expression pattern.
