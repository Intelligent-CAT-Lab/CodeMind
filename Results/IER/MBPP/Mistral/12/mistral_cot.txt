 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_matrix` takes a matrix M as input.
The function first sorts the matrix M using the `sorted()` function.
The `key` parameter of the `sorted()` function is set to `sum`, which means that the matrix elements will be sorted based on their sum.
The `sorted()` function returns a new sorted matrix, which is assigned to the variable `result`.
The function then returns the `result` variable, which is the sorted matrix.
<<<Output>>>
[[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]
