 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_sum` takes an array as input.
The first line of the function sorts the array in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
The second line initializes a variable `sum` to the first element of the sorted array.
The third line iterates over the array from the second element to the last element (inclusive).
For each element, it checks if it is different from the previous element. If it is, it adds the current element to the sum.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of the sum.
