 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and returns the maximum sum of consecutive 1's in the string.
The variable n is initialized to the length of the string.
The variable current_sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of consecutive 1's.
The variable max_sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum sum found so far.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in the string.
For each character, it checks if it is a 1. If it is, it adds 1 to current_sum. If it is not, it subtracts 1 from current_sum.
If current_sum becomes negative, it is set to 0.
The code then updates max_sum to the maximum of current_sum and max_sum.
After the loop finishes, the code returns max_sum if it is greater than 0, otherwise it returns 0.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `find_length("11000010001")` is 11.
