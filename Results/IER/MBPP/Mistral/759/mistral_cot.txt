<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_decimal` takes a single argument `num`, which is a string.
The function imports the `re` module, which is used to perform regular expression matching.
The regular expression pattern `r"""^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]{1,2})?$"""` is used to match a string that starts with one or more digits, followed by an optional decimal point and two digits after the decimal point.
The `search` method of the `dnumre` object is called with the `num` argument, which returns a `Match` object if a match is found, or `None` if no match is found.
The function returns the result of the `bool()` function applied to the `result` variable, which returns `True` if the `result` variable is not `None`, indicating that a match was found, and `False` otherwise.
