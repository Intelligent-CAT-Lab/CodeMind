 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_odd` takes a string `str1` as input.
It initializes an empty string `str2` which will be used to store the result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of `str1` (inclusive).
For each index `i` in this range, it checks if `i` is even by using the modulo operator `%`. If `i` is even, it appends the character at index `i-1` to `str2`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `str2`, which is "py".
<<<Output>>>
py
