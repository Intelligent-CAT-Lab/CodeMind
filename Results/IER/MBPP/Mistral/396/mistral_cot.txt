The code imports the re module, which is used for regular expressions.
The variable regex is initialized with a regular expression pattern that matches a string that consists of only lowercase letters or a string that starts and ends with the same lowercase letter.
The function check_char takes a string as input and uses the re.search() method to search for the regex pattern in the string. If the pattern is found, the function returns "Valid", otherwise it returns "Invalid".
<<<Output>>>
Valid
