<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_Even` takes an integer `n` as input.
The function checks if `n` is equal to its square (`n^2`) plus one (`n+1`).
If `n` is equal to its square plus one, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is an even number.
If `n` is not equal to its square plus one, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is an odd number.
<<<Output>>>
