The function `opposite_signs` takes two arguments, `x` and `y`.
The function returns `True` if the XOR of `x` and `y` is less than 0, otherwise it returns `False`.
The XOR operation returns 1 if the bits in the corresponding positions of the two operands are different, and 0 otherwise.
So, if `x` and `y` have opposite signs, the XOR of `x` and `y` will be 1, which is less than 0, so the function returns `True`.
If `x` and `y` have the same sign, the XOR of `x` and `y` will be 0, which is greater than or equal to 0, so the function returns `False`.
