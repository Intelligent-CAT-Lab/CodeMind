 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `swap_List` takes a list as input and returns a new list.
The function first calculates the length of the input list using the `len()` function and stores it in the variable `size`.
It then initializes a temporary variable `temp` to the first element of the list.
The function then swaps the first element of the list with the last element of the list using indexing.
It does this by assigning the value of the last element of the list to the first element of the list and the value of the first element of the list to the last element of the list.
Finally, the function assigns the value of the temporary variable `temp` to the last element of the list.
