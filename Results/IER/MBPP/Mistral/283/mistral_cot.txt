 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `validate(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value.
The function first initializes a variable `count` to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates 10 times.
For each iteration, it initializes a variable `temp` to the value of `n`.
It then enters another loop that iterates until `temp` becomes 0.
Inside this loop, it checks if the remainder of `temp` divided by 10 is equal to the current value of `i`. If it is, it increments the `count` variable.
After the inner loop finishes, it checks if `count` is greater than the current value of `i`. If it is, it means that the current value of `i` has been found in the number `n`, so it returns `False`.
If the inner loop finishes without finding the current value of `i`, it means that the current value of `i` is not present in the number `n`, so it continues to the next iteration of the outer loop.
After the outer loop finishes, it means that all values of `i` have been checked and none of them were found in the number `n`, so it returns `True`.
