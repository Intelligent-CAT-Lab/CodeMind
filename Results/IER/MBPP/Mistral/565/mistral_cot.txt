<<<Analysis>>>
The function `split` takes a single argument `word`, which is a string.
The function uses a list comprehension to split the string into a list of characters.
The list comprehension iterates over each character in the string `word` and returns a new list containing only the characters.
<<<Output>>>
['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']
