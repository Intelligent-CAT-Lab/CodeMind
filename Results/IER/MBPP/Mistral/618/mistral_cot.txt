 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `div_list` takes two lists as input, `nums1` and `nums2`. It uses the `map` function to apply a lambda function to each pair of elements in the two lists. The lambda function divides the first element by the second element. The result of this operation is a list of values.
The `map` function returns an iterator, which is then converted to a list using the `list` function.
The final result is a list of values obtained by dividing the elements of `nums1` by the elements of `nums2`.
