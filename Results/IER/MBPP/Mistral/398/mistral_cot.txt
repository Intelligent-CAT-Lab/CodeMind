 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_of_digits` takes a list of integers as input.
It uses a generator expression to convert each integer in the list to a string, then iterates over each character in the string and checks if it is a digit using the `isdigit()` method.
If the character is a digit, it is added to the sum.
The sum is then returned.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `sum_of_digits([10,2,56])` is 17.
The sum of the digits of 10 is 1 + 0 = 1, the sum of the digits of 2 is 2, and the sum of the digits of 56 is 5 + 6 = 11.
So the total sum of the digits of the given list is 1 + 2 + 11 = 14, which is returned by the function.
