 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `move_num` takes a string as input and returns a new string.
The function initializes two variables, `res` and `dig`, both set to an empty string.
The function then iterates over each character in the input string `test_str`.
If the character is a digit, it is added to the `dig` variable. Otherwise, it is added to the `res` variable.
After the loop finishes, the `dig` variable is concatenated to the `res` variable and returned as the final result.
