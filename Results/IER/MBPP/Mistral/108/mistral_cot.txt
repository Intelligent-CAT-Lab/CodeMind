 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `merge_sorted_list` takes three input lists: `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.
It first sorts each of the input lists using the built-in `sorted()` function.
Then it uses the `heapq.merge()` function to merge the three sorted lists into a single sorted list.
The `heapq.merge()` function takes three arguments: the first sorted list, the second sorted list, and the third sorted list. It returns an iterator that yields the elements of the merged list.
The function then converts the iterator returned by `heapq.merge()` to a list using the built-in `list()` function and returns it.
