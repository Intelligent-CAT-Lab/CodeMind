 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions and constants.
The function otherside_rightangle takes two arguments, w and h, which represent the lengths of the two sides of a right triangle.
The function calculates the length of the third side of the right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the third side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
The function uses the math.sqrt() function to calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of the two sides, which gives the length of the third side.
The function returns the value of the third side.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `otherside_rightangle(7,8)` is 8.999999999999999.
