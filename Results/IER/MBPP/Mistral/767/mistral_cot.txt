 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_pairs_count` takes two arguments: `arr` and `sum`. `arr` is a list of integers and `sum` is an integer.
The function initializes a variable `count` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of pairs that add up to the given sum.
The function then enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`, and the inner loop iterates over all elements in the list `arr` starting from the index `i+1`.
For each pair of elements, the function checks if their sum is equal to the given `sum`. If it is, it increments the `count` variable.
After both loops finish, the function returns the final value of `count`.
