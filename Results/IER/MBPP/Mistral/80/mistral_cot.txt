The function tetrahedral_number takes an integer n as input and returns the nth tetrahedral number.
The tetrahedral number is the sum of the first n natural numbers.
The formula for the nth tetrahedral number is (n * (n + 1) * (n + 2)) / 6.
The function takes the input n and applies the formula to calculate the tetrahedral number.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of tetrahedral_number(5) is 35.
