The return value of the function `remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3)` is `'The person is value tet'`.
This is because the substring 'most' has a length of 4, which is not equal to 3, so it is removed from the list of substrings.
The remaining substrings are then joined back into a string, resulting in the final output.
