 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: test_str and K.
test_str is a string that needs to be processed, and K is the length of the substring to be removed.
The function first splits the test_str into a list of substrings using the split() method.
Then it creates a new list res that contains only the substrings that have a length different from K.
It does this by using a list comprehension that iterates over the list of substrings and checks if the length of each substring is equal to K.
Finally, it joins the elements of the res list back into a string using the join() method and returns the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the function `remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3)` is `'The person is value tet'`.
This is because the substring 'most' has a length of 4, which is not equal to 3, so it is removed from the list of substrings.
The remaining substrings are then joined back into a string, resulting in the final output.
