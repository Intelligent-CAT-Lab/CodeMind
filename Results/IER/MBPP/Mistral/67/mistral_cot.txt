 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `bell_number` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the value of the `n`th Bell number.
The Bell number is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 1.
The function initializes a 2D array `bell` of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements set to 0.
It then sets the first element of the first row to 1, as the first Bell number is 1.
The function then iterates over the rows of the array, starting from the second row. For each row, it sets the first element to the value of the corresponding element in the previous row.
For each element in the row, it sets the value to the sum of the corresponding element in the previous row and the element immediately above it.
Finally, the function returns the value of the last element in the last row, which is the `n`th Bell number.
