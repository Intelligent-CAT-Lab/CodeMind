 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `merge` takes a list as input and returns a new list.
The function first uses the built-in `zip` function to flatten the input list.
The `zip` function takes two or more iterables and returns an iterator of tuples, where each tuple will have one element from each of the input iterables.
In this case, the input list is a list of lists, so `zip(*lst)` will flatten it into a list of tuples, where each tuple will have one element from each of the sub-lists.
The function then uses a list comprehension to convert each tuple into a list and return the resulting list.
<<<Output>>>
[['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]
