The function `consecutive_duplicates` takes a list of integers as input.
It uses the `groupby` function from the `itertools` module to group the elements of the list by their value.
The `groupby` function returns an iterator of groups, where each group is a tuple of the form (key, group), where key is the unique value of the group and group is the list of elements in the group.
The function then returns a list of the keys of the groups, which are the unique values of the elements in the list.
In this case, the input list is `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]`.
The `groupby` function groups the elements of the list by their value, resulting in the following groups:
[(0, [0, 0]), (1, [1]), (2, [2]), (3, [3]), (4, [4, 4]), (5, [5]), (6, [6, 6, 6]), (7, [7]), (8, [8]), (9, [9]), (4, [4, 4]), (None, [])]
The keys of the groups are: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, None]
The function returns a list of the keys of the groups, which is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]`.

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]
