 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `loss_amount` takes two arguments: `actual_cost` and `sale_amount`.
The function first checks if the `sale_amount` is greater than the `actual_cost`. If it is, it calculates the difference between the two and assigns it to the variable `amount`.
The function then returns the value of `amount`.
If the `sale_amount` is not greater than the `actual_cost`, the function returns 0.
In this case, the `actual_cost` is 1500 and the `sale_amount` is 1200. Since 1200 is less than 1500, the function returns 0.
