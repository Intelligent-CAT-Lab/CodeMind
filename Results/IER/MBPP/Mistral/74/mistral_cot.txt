 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_samepatterns` takes two arguments: `colors` and `patterns`.
The function first checks if the length of the two lists is the same. If not, it returns False.
It then creates three empty sets: `pset`, `sset` and `sdict`.
The function then iterates through the `patterns` list and for each pattern, it adds it to `pset` and `sset`.
It also checks if the pattern is in the `sdict` dictionary. If it is not, it adds it to the dictionary with an empty list as its value.
It then appends the corresponding color from the `colors` list to the list of colors for that pattern in the `sdict` dictionary.
After the loop finishes, the function checks if the length of `pset` and `sset` are the same. If not, it returns False.
It then iterates through the values in the `sdict` dictionary and for each value, it checks if all the values in the list are the same. If not, it returns False.
If all the conditions are met, the function returns True.
