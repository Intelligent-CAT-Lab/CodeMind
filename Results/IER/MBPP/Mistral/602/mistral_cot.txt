 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and iterates over each character in the string using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if the substring of the string up to that character (exclusive) has a count of that character greater than 1.
If it does, it means that the character is repeated and the function returns that character.
If no repeated character is found, the function returns None.
<<<Output>>>
'a'
