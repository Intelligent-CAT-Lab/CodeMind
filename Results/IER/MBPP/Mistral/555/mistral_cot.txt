 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `difference` takes an integer `n` as input.
The variable `S` is initialized to the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. It is calculated using the formula `(n*(n + 1))//2`.
The variable `res` is then calculated as the product of `S` and `S-1`.
The function returns the value of `res`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `difference(3)` is 12.
<<<Analysis>>>
When `n` is 3, the value of `S` is calculated as `(3*(3 + 1))//2 = 6`.
The value of `res` is then calculated as `6*5 = 30`.
Therefore, the return value of `difference(3)` is 30.
<<<Output>>>
30
