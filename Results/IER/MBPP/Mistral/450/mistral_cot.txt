 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_string` takes two arguments: `str` and `l`. `str` is a list of strings and `l` is an integer.
The function uses a list comprehension to extract all the strings in the input list that have a length of `l`. It does this by iterating over each element in the input list and checking if its length is equal to `l`. If it is, the element is added to the resulting list.
The resulting list is then returned by the function.
