 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `add_pairwise` takes a tuple as input, in this case `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`.
The function uses a generator expression to create a new tuple, where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in the input tuple.
The generator expression uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements in the input tuple, and then adds the two elements together.
The resulting tuple is then returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
(6, 12, 14, 16, 18)
