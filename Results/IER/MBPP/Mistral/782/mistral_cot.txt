<<<Analysis>>>
The function odd_length_sum takes an array as input.
It initializes a variable Sum to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the elements in the array.
It also initializes a variable l to the length of the array.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to l-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all elements in the array.
For each element i in this range, it calculates the sum of the elements in the array using the formula:
(((i + 1) *(l - i) + 1) // 2) * arr[i]
This formula is based on the sum of an arithmetic series with first term a = 1, last term l = l, and number of terms n = l - i + 1.
The formula calculates the sum of the elements in the array by multiplying the sum of the arithmetic series by the current element in the array.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of Sum, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
