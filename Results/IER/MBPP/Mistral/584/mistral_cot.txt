<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression matching operations.
The function takes a string as input and uses a for loop to iterate over all occurrences of the regular expression pattern r"\w+ly" in the string.
The pattern matches any sequence of one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores) followed by the word "ly".
For each occurrence of the pattern, the function uses the finditer() method of the re module to extract the match object.
The match object contains information about the start, end, and group(0) of the match.
The group(0) returns the actual matched text.
The function then returns a string in the format "(start-end): matched text" using string formatting.
For the input "Clearly, he has no excuse for such behavior.", the function finds two occurrences of the pattern: "Clearly" and "such".
The function returns two strings in the format "(start-end): matched text": "(1-5): Clearly" and "(17-21): such".
<<<Output>>>
("1-5": Clearly, "17-21": such)
