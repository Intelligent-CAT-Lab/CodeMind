<<<Analysis>>>
The function list\_split takes two arguments: S, which is a list of strings, and step, which is an integer.
The function uses list comprehension to split the list S into sublists of length step.
It does this by iterating over the range of step, and for each index i in that range, it takes a slice of S starting from i and going up to i+step (exclusive).
The resulting list of sublists is returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
[['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f'], ['g', 'h', 'i'], ['j', 'k', 'l'], ['m', 'n']]
