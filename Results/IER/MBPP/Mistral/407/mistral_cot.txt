 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `rearrange_bigger` takes an integer `n` as input.
It first converts the integer `n` to a string and then converts it back to a list of strings.
It then iterates over the list of strings in reverse order, starting from the second to last element.
For each element, it checks if the current element is smaller than the next element. If it is, it extracts the current element and the next element and stores them in two separate lists.
It then finds the smallest element in the list of elements greater than the first element of the current list and removes it from the list.
It then sorts the remaining elements in the list in ascending order.
It then concatenates the smallest element with the sorted list and converts the resulting list back to a string.
Finally, it converts the string back to an integer and returns it.
The function returns False if no rearrangement is possible.
For the input `12`, the function first converts it to the string `'12'`, which is then converted to the list `['1', '2']`.
It then iterates over the list in reverse order, starting from the second to last element.
It checks if the current element is smaller than the next element. Since `'1'` is smaller than `'2'`, it extracts the current element and the next element and stores them in two separate lists.
It then finds the smallest element in the list of elements greater than the first element of the current list, which is `'2'`. It removes it from the list.
It then sorts the remaining elements in the list in ascending order, which is `['1']`.
It then concatenates the smallest element with the sorted list, which is `['1', '2']`.
It converts the resulting list back to a string, which is `'12'`.
It converts the string back to an integer, which is 12.
Therefore, the return value of `rearrange_bigger(12)` is 12.
