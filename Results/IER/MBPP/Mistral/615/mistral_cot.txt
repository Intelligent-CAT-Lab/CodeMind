 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `average_tuple` takes a list of tuples as input. It uses the `zip` function to flatten the list of tuples into a list of lists, where each inner list contains the values of each tuple.
Then it applies a list comprehension to each inner list, which calculates the sum of all the values in the list and divides it by the length of the list.
The result is a list of lists, where each inner list contains the average of the values in the corresponding tuple.
Finally, the function returns the list of lists.
