 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable j is initialized to 0 and will be used to calculate the odd number to be added to the sum.
The variable sm is initialized to 0 and will be used to accumulate the sum of odd numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider the number 1 and 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the odd number j using the formula 2*i-1, which gives 1 and 3 for i=1 and i=2 respectively.
It then calculates the cube of j and adds it to the sum sm.
The condition is met when i is 1 and 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sm, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
