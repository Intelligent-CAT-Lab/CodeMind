 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_product_tuple` takes a list of tuples as input. It uses a list comprehension to generate a new list of absolute values of the product of each tuple in the input list. The `max` function is then applied to this new list to find the maximum value.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `max_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)])` is 144.
