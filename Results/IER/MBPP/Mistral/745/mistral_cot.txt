<<<Analysis>>>
The function `divisible_by_digits` takes two arguments, `startnum` and `endnum`, and returns a list of numbers between `startnum` and `endnum` that are divisible by all of their digits.
The function uses a list comprehension to generate the list of numbers to check. It iterates over all numbers in the range `[startnum, endnum]` and checks if any of their digits are zero or if any of their digits do not divide the number evenly. If none of these conditions are met, the number is added to the list.
The function then returns this list.
