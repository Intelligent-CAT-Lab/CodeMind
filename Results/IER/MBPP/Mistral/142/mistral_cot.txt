 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_samepair` takes three lists as input: `list1`, `list2` and `list3`.
It uses the `zip` function to iterate over the corresponding elements of the three lists simultaneously.
The function then checks if the three elements are equal using the triple equality operator `==` and the `sum` function to count the number of times this condition is met.
The final result is the count of pairs of elements that are equal in all three lists.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `count_samepair([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],[2,2,3,1,2,6,7,9],[2,1,3,1,2,6,7,9])` is 1.
This is because the pairs (2,2,3) and (6,7,9) are the only pairs that are equal in all three lists.
