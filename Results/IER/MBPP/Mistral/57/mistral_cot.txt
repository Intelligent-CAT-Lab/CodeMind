 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_Max_Num` takes an array `arr` as input.
The length of the array is calculated using the `len()` function and stored in the variable `n`.
The array is sorted in descending order using the `sort()` function with the `reverse` parameter set to `True`.
The first element of the sorted array is assigned to the variable `num`.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from the second element to the last element of the array (inclusive).
For each element in this range, it multiplies the current value of `num` by 10 and adds the current element to `num`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `num`, which is the maximum number in the array.
