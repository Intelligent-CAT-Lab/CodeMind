 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_product` takes an array `arr` as input.
The variable `n` is initialized to the length of the array `arr`.
The variable `mpis` is initialized to a copy of the array `arr`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the first element of the array to the second last element of the array (inclusive).
For each element `i` in this range, it initializes the variable `current_prod` to the current element `arr[i]`.
It then enters another loop that iterates from the next element `j` after `i` to the last element of the array (inclusive).
For each element `j` in this range, it checks if the previous element `arr[j-1]` is greater than the current element `arr[j]`. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it multiplies the current product `current_prod` by the current element `arr[j]` and updates the maximum product `mpis[j]` if the new product is greater than the previous maximum product.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the maximum product from the array `mpis`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6])` is 150.
