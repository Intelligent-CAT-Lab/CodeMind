 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `substract_elements` takes two tuples as input, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. It uses the `map` function to apply a lambda function to each element of the two tuples. The lambda function subtracts the second element of the tuple from the first element of the tuple. The resulting list of tuples is then converted to a tuple using the `tuple` function and returned.
