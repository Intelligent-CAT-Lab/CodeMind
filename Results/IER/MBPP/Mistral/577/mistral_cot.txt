The function `last_Digit_Factorial` takes an integer `n` as input.
The function first checks if `n` is equal to 0, in which case it returns 1.
If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it returns `n` itself.
If `n` is equal to 3, it returns 6.
If `n` is equal to 4, it returns 4.
If `n` is greater than 4, it returns 0.
