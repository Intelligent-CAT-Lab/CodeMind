 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `tuple_modulo` takes two tuples as input, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over the corresponding elements of the two tuples.
For each pair of elements, it applies the modulo operation using the `%` operator. The result is stored in a list called `res`.
Finally, the function returns the list `res` as a tuple.
<<<Output>>>
((0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0))
