 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_series` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic series.
The function first checks if `n` is less than 1, in which case it returns 0.
Otherwise, it returns `n` plus the sum of the first `n-2` terms of the series, which is obtained by recursively calling the function `sum_series` with `n-2` as the argument.
The recursion continues until `n` is 1, at which point the function returns 1.
