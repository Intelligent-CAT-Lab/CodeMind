 <<<Analysis>>>
The function lps takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest palindrome substring of that string.
The function first initializes a 2D array L of size n x n, where n is the length of the input string.
It then initializes the first diagonal elements of L to 1, since a palindrome of length 1 is always a valid palindrome.
The function then iterates over all possible substrings of length cl, where cl ranges from 2 to n.
For each substring, it checks if the first and last characters are equal and if the length of the substring is 2. If so, it sets the length of the substring to 2.
If the first and last characters are not equal, it checks if the substring is a palindrome by comparing the characters in the middle of the substring. If it is, it sets the length of the substring to 2.
If the substring is not a palindrome, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing the characters in the middle of the substring. If it is, it sets the length of the substring to the sum of the length of the palindrome substring ending at the index before the middle index and the length of the palindrome substring ending at the index after the middle index plus 2.
If the substring is not a palindrome, it sets the length of the substring to the maximum of the length of the palindrome substring ending at the index before the middle index and the length of the palindrome substring ending at the index after the middle index.
Finally, the function returns the length of the longest palindrome substring, which is the length of the substring at index 0 and n-1 of the L array.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `lps("TENS FOR TENS")` is 10.
The longest palindrome substring of the string "TENS FOR TENS" is "TENS", which has a length of 4.
Since the length of the substring at index 0 and n-1 of the L array is 4, the function returns 4.
