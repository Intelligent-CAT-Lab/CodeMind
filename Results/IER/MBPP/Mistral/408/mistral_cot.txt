 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `k_smallest_pairs` takes three arguments: `nums1`, `nums2` and `k`.
`nums1` and `nums2` are two lists of integers, and `k` is an integer representing the number of pairs to be returned.
The function uses a priority queue to keep track of the pairs that need to be processed.
The priority queue is initialized as an empty list.
The function then defines a helper function `push` that takes two arguments `i` and `j`, and adds the pair `[nums1[i] + nums2[j], i, j]` to the priority queue.
The function then calls the `push` function with the initial values of `i` and `j` as 0.
The function then enters a while loop that continues until the priority queue is empty or the number of pairs processed is equal to `k`.
Inside the while loop, the function pops the smallest pair from the priority queue and adds it to the `pairs` list.
The function then calls the `push` function with the next pair of `i` and `j` to be processed.
The function also adds a special case to handle the case where `j` is 0, in which case it pushes the next pair of `i` and 0 to the priority queue.
After the while loop finishes, the function returns the `pairs` list.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `k_smallest_pairs([1,3,7],[2,4,6],2)` is `[[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6]]`.
