 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_max_sum` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of length `n+1` representing the maximum sum of a subsequence of the first `n` integers.
The function initializes a list `res` with the first two integers, 0 and 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from the third integer to `n+1` (inclusive).
For each integer `i`, it appends the maximum of `i` and the sum of the previous `i/2`, `i/3`, `i/4` and `i/5` integers to the `res` list.
The condition is met when i is 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of the last element of the `res` list, which is 115.
