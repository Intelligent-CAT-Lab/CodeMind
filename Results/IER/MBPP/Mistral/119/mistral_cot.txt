 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `search` takes an array `arr` as input.
The variable `n` is initialized to the length of the array `arr`.
The variable `XOR` is initialized to 0, which will be used to perform an XOR operation on each element of the array.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider each element of the array.
For each element `arr[i]`, it performs an XOR operation with the current value of `XOR`.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `XOR`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the function `search([1,1,2,2,3])` is 15.
