 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and initializes an empty string variable called result.
It then iterates through each character in the input string using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if its index is even (i.e., divisible by 2). If it is, it adds the character to the result string.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the result string.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `odd_values_string('abcdef')` is an empty string, as none of the characters in the input string have an even index.
