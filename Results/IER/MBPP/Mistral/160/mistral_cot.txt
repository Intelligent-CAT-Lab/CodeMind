 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_solution` takes three arguments: `a`, `b`, and `n`. In this case, `a` is 2, `b` is 3, and `n` is 7.
The function starts by initializing `i` to 0.
It then enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `i * a` is less than or equal to `n`.
Inside the loop, it checks if `(n - (i * a)) % b` is equal to 0. If it is, it means that `n` can be expressed as `i * a + j * b`, where `j` is an integer.
If this condition is met, the function returns a tuple containing `i` and `j`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns `None` if no solution is found.
