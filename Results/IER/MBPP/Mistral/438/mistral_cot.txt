 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_bidirectional` takes a list of tuples as input. It initializes a variable `res` to 0, which will be used to count the number of pairs of tuples that have the same first and second elements.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element `idx` in the input list.
For each element `idx`, it enters another loop that iterates over all elements `iidx` in the input list starting from `idx+1` up to the end of the list.
For each pair of elements `(idx, iidx)`, it checks if the first element of `iidx` is equal to the second element of `idx` and if the second element of `idx` is equal to the first element of `iidx`. If both conditions are met, it increments the `res` variable.
After both loops finish, the code prints the final value of `res`, which is the number of pairs of tuples that have the same first and second elements.
