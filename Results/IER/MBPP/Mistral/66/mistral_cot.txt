 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `pos_count` takes a list as input and initializes a variable `pos_count` to 0.
It then iterates through each number in the list using a for loop.
For each number, it checks if it is greater than or equal to 0 using an if statement.
If the number is greater than or equal to 0, it increments the `pos_count` variable by 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `pos_count`.
