 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_of_nth` takes two arguments: `test_list` and `N`. `test_list` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. `N` is the index of the maximum value in the `test_list`.
The function uses list comprehension to extract the value at index `N` of each inner list in `test_list`. It then uses the `max` function to find the maximum value among these extracted values.
The final result is returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `max_of_nth([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2)` is 19.
This is because the maximum value in the second test case (`[[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]]`) is 19, which is the value at index 2 of the `test_list`.
