 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range` takes three arguments: `n`, `l`, and `r`.
`n` is the number whose bits need to be checked, `l` is the leftmost bit position and `r` is the rightmost bit position.
The function first calculates the number `num` using the formula `((1 << r) - 1) ^ ((1 << (l - 1)) - 1)`.
This formula calculates the number of bits set between the positions `l` and `r` in the binary representation of `num`.
The function then calculates the number `new_num` by performing a bitwise AND operation between `n` and `num`.
This operation sets all the bits in `n` that are not set in `num` to 0.
Finally, the function checks if `new_num` is equal to 0. If it is, it means that all the bits between positions `l` and `r` in the binary representation of `n` are set, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
