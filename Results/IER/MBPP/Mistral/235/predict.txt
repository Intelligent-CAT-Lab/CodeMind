The return value of `even_bit_set_number(10)` is 14.
The binary representation of 10 is 1010, and the binary representation of 14 is 1110.
The function sets the 4th bit (count 2) and the 5th bit (count 3) in `res`, which corresponds to the values 16 and 32, respectively.
So the final value of `n | res` is 10 + 16 + 32 = 14.
