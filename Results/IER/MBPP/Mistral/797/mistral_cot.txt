 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_in_range` takes two arguments, `l` and `r`, which represent the lower and upper limits of the range to sum the odd numbers in.
The function first calls the `sum_odd` function with the upper limit `r` as its argument. This function calculates the sum of the first `r` odd numbers using the formula `terms * terms`, where `terms` is the number of terms in the range, which is calculated as `(n + 1)//2`.
The function then calls the `sum_odd` function with the argument `l - 1`, which represents the sum of the first `l - 1` odd numbers.
Finally, it returns the difference between the sum of the first `r` odd numbers and the sum of the first `l - 1` odd numbers.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `sum_in_range(2,5)` is 10.
This is because the sum of the first 5 odd numbers is 15 (1+3+5+7+9), and the sum of the first 2 odd numbers is 3 (1+3). Therefore, the difference between these two sums is 15 - 3 = 12, which is the return value of the function.
