 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `intersection_array` takes two lists as input, `array_nums1` and `array_nums2`. It uses the built-in `filter` function to create a new list that contains only the elements of `array_nums2` that are also present in `array_nums1`. The `filter` function takes a lambda function as an argument, which checks if the current element of `array_nums2` is in `array_nums1`. The resulting list is then returned by the function.
