<<<Analysis>>>
The function `even_position` takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value.
The function uses the built-in `all` function to check if all elements in the list satisfy a certain condition.
The condition is that the remainder of each element when divided by 2 is equal to the remainder of its index when divided by 2.
The function iterates over the list using the `range` function and checks the remainder of each element and its index using the modulo operator `%`.
If the remainder of an element is not equal to the remainder of its index, the function returns `False` immediately, since the condition is not satisfied.
If the function reaches the end of the list without finding any element that does not satisfy the condition, it returns `True`.
<<<Output>>>
False
