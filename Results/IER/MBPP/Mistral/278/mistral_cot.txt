 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_first_elements` takes a tuple as input, which is `(1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)`.
The function then iterates over the elements of the tuple using the `enumerate()` function, which returns a tuple for each element, containing the index and the element itself.
For each element, the function checks if it is a tuple using the `isinstance()` function. If it is, the function breaks out of the loop using the `break` statement.
The function then returns the index of the first non-tuple element, which is 3 in this case.
<<<Output>>>
3
