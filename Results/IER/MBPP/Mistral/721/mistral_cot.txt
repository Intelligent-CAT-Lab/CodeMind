 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `maxAverageOfPath` takes a list of lists as input, where each inner list represents a row of a matrix. The matrix represents the cost of moving from one node to another in a graph. The function returns the maximum average cost of a path from the top left node to the bottom right node.

The function first initializes two 2D arrays `dp` of size `(N+1) x (N+1)`, where `N` is the length of the input list. The first element of the first row of `dp` is set to the first element of the first row of the input list.

The function then iterates through the rows of the input list, and for each row, it updates the first `j` elements of the `dp` array by adding the cost of the current row to the maximum of the `dp` array of the previous row and the `j`th element of the current row.

The function then iterates through the columns of the input list, and for each column, it updates the first `i` elements of the `dp` array by adding the cost of the current column to the maximum of the `dp` array of the previous row and the `i`th element of the current column.

Finally, the function returns the maximum average cost of a path from the top left node to the bottom right node by dividing the maximum value in the `dp` array by `(2 * N - 1)`, where `N` is the length of the input list.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of `maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]])` is 10.666666666666667.

This is because the maximum average cost of a path from the top left node to the bottom right node is 10.666666666666667.
