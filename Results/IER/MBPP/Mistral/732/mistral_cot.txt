The function `replace_specialchar` takes a string as input and uses regular expressions to replace all occurrences of the special characters ',' and '.' with ':'.
The regular expression `[ ,.]` matches any character that is either a comma or a period.
The `re.sub()` function replaces all occurrences of the pattern in the input string with the replacement string.
In this case, the input string is 'Python language, Programming language.'.
The regular expression `[ ,.]` matches the comma and the period in the input string.
The replacement string is ':'.
So, the function replaces all occurrences of the comma and the period with ':'.
The final output of the function is 'Python language: Programming language:'.
