 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `Find_Min_Length` takes a list of lists as input. It uses the built-in Python function `min` to find the minimum length of any list in the input list. The `min` function takes an iterable as input and returns the smallest element.
In this case, the input list is `[[1],[1,2]]`. The length of the first list is 1 and the length of the second list is 2. Since 1 is smaller than 2, the function returns 1 as the minimum length.
