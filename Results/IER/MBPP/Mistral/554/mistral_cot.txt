 <<<Analysis>>>
The function Split takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list.
The function first initializes an empty list called od_li, which will be used to store the odd numbers.
It then iterates through each element in the input list using a for loop.
For each element, it checks if it is odd by using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder of the element divided by 2 is not equal to 0, it means the element is odd and is added to the od_li list using the append() method.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the od_li list containing only the odd numbers.
<<<Output>>>
