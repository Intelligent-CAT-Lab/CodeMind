 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sumofFactors` takes an integer `n` as input.
The function first checks if `n` is even, if not it returns 0.
Then it initializes a variable `res` to 1 and enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).
For each number `i` in this range, it initializes two variables `count` and `curr_sum` to 0 and 1 respectively.
It then enters a while loop that continues until `n` is no longer divisible by `i`.
Inside the while loop, it increments `count` and divides `n` by `i`.
It also calculates `curr_term` by multiplying `i` by itself.
Then it adds `curr_term` to `curr_sum`.
After the while loop finishes, it multiplies `res` by `curr_sum`.
Finally, it checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, if so it multiplies `res` by 1 + `n`.
The function returns the final value of `res`.
For `n = 18`, the function first checks that 18 is even, which is true.
Then it initializes `res` to 1 and enters the loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of 18 (inclusive), which is 4.
For `i = 2`, it initializes `count` and `curr_sum` to 0 and 1 respectively.
It then enters the while loop that continues until 18 is no longer divisible by 2.
Inside the while loop, it increments `count` and divides 18 by 2.
It also calculates `curr_term` by multiplying 2 by itself.
Then it adds `curr_term` to `curr_sum`.
After the while loop finishes, it multiplies `res` by `curr_sum`, which is 1.
Then it checks if 18 is greater than or equal to 2, which is true.
It multiplies `res` by 1 + 18, which is 19.
Finally, the function returns 19.
