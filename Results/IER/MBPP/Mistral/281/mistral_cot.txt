The function `all_unique` takes a list as input and returns a boolean value.
The function first checks if the length of the list is greater than the length of its set. If it is, it means that there are duplicate elements in the list, so the function returns `False`.
If the length of the list is equal to the length of its set, it means that all elements in the list are unique, so the function returns `True`.
In this case, the input list is `[1,2,3]`, which has a length of 3. The set of this list is `{1, 2, 3}`, which also has a length of 3. Since the length of the list and the set are equal, the function returns `True`.
<<<Output>>>
True
