 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string s as input.
The length of the string is calculated using the len() function and stored in the variable n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all characters in the string except the first one.
For each character i in this range, it checks if it is different from the first character s[0]. If it is, the function returns False immediately.
After the loop finishes, the function returns True if all characters are the same.
<<<Output>>>
True
