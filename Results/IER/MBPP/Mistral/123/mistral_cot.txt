 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `amicable_numbers_sum` takes an integer `limit` as input.
The function first checks if the input is an integer and if it is greater than 0. If either of these conditions is not met, the function returns an error message.
The function then initializes an empty set `amicables`.
The function enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `limit` (inclusive).
For each number `num` in this range, it checks if `num` is already in the set `amicables`. If it is, the function skips to the next number.
If `num` is not in the set `amicables`, the function calculates the sum of its factors using a list comprehension.
The function then calculates the sum of the factors of the sum of factors using another list comprehension.
If `num` is equal to the sum of the factors of the sum of factors and `num` is not equal to the sum of factors, the function adds `num` and the sum of factors to the set `amicables`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the sum of the numbers in the set `amicables`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `amicable_numbers_sum(999)` is 1000.
