 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sys module, which provides access to various system-specific information, including the size of objects in memory.
The function tuple_size takes a tuple_list as input, which is a tuple of strings.
The function uses the sys.getsizeof() function to get the size of the tuple_list in bytes.
The return value of the function is the size of the tuple_list in bytes.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3) )` would be 36.
