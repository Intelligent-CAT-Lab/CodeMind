 <<<Analysis>>>
The function max_Product takes an array as input and returns the maximum product of two elements in the array.
The function first checks if the length of the array is less than 2, in which case it returns "No pairs exists".
It then initializes two variables x and y to the first two elements of the array.
The function then enters two nested loops that iterate over all pairs of elements in the array.
For each pair, it checks if the product of the two elements is greater than the current maximum product (x * y). If it is, it updates the values of x and y to be the two elements in the current pair.
After the loops finish, the function returns the values of x and y, which represent the maximum product of two elements in the array.
