 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sequential_search` takes two arguments: a list `dlist` and an item `item`.
The variable `pos` is initialized to 0 and `found` is initialized to False.
The function enters a loop that iterates until `pos` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `dlist` or `found` is True.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current element of the list `dlist` is equal to the item `item`. If it is, it sets `found` to True and breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it increments `pos` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns a tuple containing the value of `found` and `pos`.
<<<Output>>>
(True, 6)
