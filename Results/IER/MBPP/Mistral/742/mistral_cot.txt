<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions and constants.
The variable side is initialized to 3.
The function calculates the area of a tetrahedron using the formula:
area = sqrt(3) * (side * side)
The value of the constant sqrt(3) is calculated using the math.sqrt() function, which returns the square root of a number.
The value of the variable side is squared using the * operator.
The result is then multiplied by the constant sqrt(3) using the * operator.
The final value is returned by the function.
