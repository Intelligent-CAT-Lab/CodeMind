 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two` takes an integer `n` as input.
The function first checks if `n` is odd by using the modulo operator `%` with 2. If `n` is odd, the function returns `False`.
If `n` is even, the function returns `True`.
This is because any even number can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2.
<<<Output>>>
False
