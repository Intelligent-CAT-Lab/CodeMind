 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_kth` takes three arguments: `arr1`, `arr2` and `k`. `arr1` and `arr2` are two lists of integers, and `k` is an integer representing the kth smallest element in the concatenation of `arr1` and `arr2`.
The function first sorts the concatenation of `arr1` and `arr2` in ascending order. It does this by iterating through the two lists and comparing their elements. If `arr1[i]` is less than `arr2[j]`, it adds `arr1[i]` to the sorted list at index `d`. If `arr1[i]` is greater than `arr2[j]`, it adds `arr2[j]` to the sorted list at index `d`. The loop continues until either `arr1` or `arr2` has been completely iterated through.
After the sorted list has been created, the function returns the kth smallest element in the sorted list by accessing the element at index `k - 1`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `find_kth([2, 3, 6, 7, 9], [1, 4, 8, 10], 5)` is 6.
