 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_K` takes two arguments: `test_tup` and `K`. `test_tup` is a tuple of length 5, containing the elements (10, 4, 5, 6, 8). `K` is an integer, in this case 6.
The function initializes a variable `res` to `False`. It then enters a loop that iterates over each element in `test_tup`.
For each element, it checks if it is equal to `K`. If it is, it sets `res` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of `res`.
<<<Output>>>
False
