The function `remove_parenthesis` takes a list of items as input.
It uses a for loop to iterate over each item in the list.
For each item, it uses the `re.sub` function to remove any parentheses that are present in the item.
The regular expression `r" ?\([^)]+\)"` matches any sequence of characters enclosed in parentheses, but only if there is a space before the opening parenthesis and no closing parenthesis immediately following the opening parenthesis.
The function returns the modified item.
