 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the heapq module, which provides heap queue operations.
The function expensive_items takes two arguments: items, which is a list of dictionaries, and n, which is an integer.
The function uses the heapq.nlargest() function to extract the n most expensive items from the list of items. The key argument is a lambda function that returns the price of each item.
The function returns the list of expensive_items.
<<<Output>>>
[{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}]
