 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `wind_chill` takes two arguments, `v` and `t`, which represent the wind speed and temperature, respectively.
The function calculates the wind chill using the formula:
windchill = 13.12 + 0.6215*t -  11.37*math.pow(v, 0.16) + 0.3965*t*math.pow(v, 0.16)
The formula takes into account the wind speed and temperature to calculate the wind chill, which is a measure of how cold it feels outside.
The function then rounds the result to the nearest integer using the `round()` function and returns the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `wind_chill(120,35)` would be 100.
