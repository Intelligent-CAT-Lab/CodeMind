 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of integers as input and returns the largest subset of integers that are relatively prime to each other.
The function first initializes an array dp of length n, where n is the length of the input list. It initializes the last element of the array to 1, which means that the largest subset that can be formed with the last element is 1.
Then, it iterates over the array from the second last element to the first element. For each element, it finds the maximum subset size that can be formed by including the current element and excluding any other element. It does this by iterating over all the elements after the current element and checking if they are relatively prime to the current element. If they are, it adds the maximum subset size that can be formed with them to the maximum subset size that can be formed with the current element.
Finally, it returns the maximum subset size that can be formed with all the elements in the input list.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the function `largest_subset([ 1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18 ])` is 18.
The largest subset that can be formed with these numbers is [1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18].
