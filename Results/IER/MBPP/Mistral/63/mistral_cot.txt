 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_difference` takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains two integers, a and b.
The function first creates a new list `temp` by applying a list comprehension to the input list. For each tuple in the input list, it calculates the absolute difference between b and a, and appends it to the new list `temp`.
The function then uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value in `temp`.
Finally, the function returns the maximum value found in `temp`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)])` is 6.
This is because the maximum difference between any two elements in the input list is 6 (between (10, 3) and (1, 2)).
