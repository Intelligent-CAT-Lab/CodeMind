 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_quotation` takes a string `text1` as input.
It uses the `re.findall` function from the `re` module to search for all occurrences of a pattern in the input string.
The pattern is a regular expression `r'"(.*?)"'`, which matches any string enclosed in double quotes.
The `.*?` inside the quotes matches any characters (except newline) between 0 and unlimited times, which means it matches the entire string inside the quotes.
The `re.findall` function returns a list of all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the input string.
In this case, the input string is `'Cortex "A53" Based "multi" tasking "Processor"`.
The pattern `r'"(.*?)"'` matches the following substrings:
* `"Cortex "A53"`
* `"Based "multi"`
* `"tasking "Processor"`
The `re.findall` function returns a list containing these three substrings.
<<<Output>>>
['Cortex "A53"', 'Based "multi"', 'tasking "Processor"']
