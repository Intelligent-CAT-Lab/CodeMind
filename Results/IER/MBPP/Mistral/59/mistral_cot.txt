<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_octagonal` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is an octagonal number (i.e., a number that can be written as the sum of the squares of its digits) and `False` otherwise.
The function first calculates the sum of the squares of the digits of `n` using the formula `3 * n * n - 2 * n`.
For example, for `n = 5`, the sum of the squares of its digits is `3 * 5 * 5 - 2 * 5 = 75 - 10 = 65`.
The function then checks if the sum of the squares of the digits is equal to `n` itself. If it is, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
