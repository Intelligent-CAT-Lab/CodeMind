 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `text_lowercase_underscore` takes a string `text` as input.
It uses a regular expression pattern `'^[a-z]+_[a-z]+$'` to check if the string meets the condition that it starts and ends with one or more lowercase letters, followed by an underscore, followed by one or more lowercase letters.
The function uses the `re.search()` method to search for a match of this pattern in the input string.
If a match is found, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
