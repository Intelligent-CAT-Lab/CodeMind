<<<Analysis>>>
The function `string_to_list` takes a string as input and returns a list.
The function first converts the string to a list using the `list()` function.
Then it uses the `split()` method of the string to split the string into a list of substrings, where each substring is separated by a space.
The resulting list is returned by the function.
