 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_Of_product` takes an input `n` and returns the value of `binomial_Coeff(2 * n, n - 1)`.
The `binomial_Coeff` function takes two inputs `n` and `k` and returns the value of the binomial coefficient `nCk`, which is the number of ways to choose `k` items from a set of `n` items without regard to order.
The `binomial_Coeff` function initializes an array `C` of size `k + 1` with all elements set to 0. It then sets `C[0]` to 1, which represents the case where no items are chosen (nC0 is 1).
The function then enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1`, while the inner loop iterates from `min(i, k)` to 0 in steps of -1. For each iteration of the inner loop, it adds the value of `C[j - 1]` to `C[j]`, which represents the case where `j` items are chosen from a set of `i` items.
Finally, the function returns the value of `C[k]`, which is the number of ways to choose `k` items from a set of `2n` items without regard to order.
For the input `n = 3`, the function first calculates `binomial_Coeff(2 * 3, 3 - 1)`, which is `binomial_Coeff(6, 2)`. This in turn calculates `C[2] = C[1] + C[0]`, which is `C[1] + 1`, since `C[0]` is already set to 1. The function then calculates `C[1] = C[0] + C[1]`, which is `1 + 1`, since `C[0]` is already set to 1. Finally, the function returns `C[2] = C[1] + C[0]`, which is `1 + 1`, since `C[1]` is already set to 1.
