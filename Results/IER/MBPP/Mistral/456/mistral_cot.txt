 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `reverse_string_list` takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list of strings where each string is reversed.
The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list by iterating over each string in the input list and applying the `[::-1]` slice notation to reverse the string.
The resulting list is stored in the variable `result`.
<<<Output>>>
