<<<Analysis>>>
The function `long_words` takes two arguments: `n` and `str`. `n` is an integer representing the maximum length of a word to be included in the list of long words. `str` is a string that will be split into a list of words.
The function initializes an empty list called `word_len` that will be used to store the long words.
It then splits the input string `str` into a list of words using the `split()` method.
The function then iterates over each word in the list of words using a for loop.
For each word, it checks if its length is greater than `n`. If it is, it appends the word to the `word_len` list.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the `word_len` list.
