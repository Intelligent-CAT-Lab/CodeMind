 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_Pairs` takes two arguments: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is a list of integers and `n` is the length of the list.
The function initializes a variable `cnt` to 0, which will be used to count the number of pairs of distinct elements in the list.
The code then enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider each element in the list.
For each element i in this range, the inner loop iterates from i+1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all elements after i in the list.
For each pair of elements (i,j), the code checks if they are distinct by comparing them using the `!=` operator. If they are distinct, it increments the count by 1.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.
