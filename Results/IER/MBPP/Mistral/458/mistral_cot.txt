<<<Analysis>>>
The function `rectangle_area` takes two arguments, `l` and `b`, which represent the length and width of a rectangle, respectively.
The function calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width, and stores the result in the variable `area`.
The function then returns the value of the `area` variable.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `rectangle_area(10,20)` is 200.
