<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_Volume` takes three arguments: `l`, `b`, and `h`. These represent the length, width, and height of a rectangular box, respectively.
The function calculates the volume of the box by multiplying its length, width, and height, and then dividing the result by 2.
The formula used to calculate the volume is: (l * b * h) / 2
The function then returns the calculated volume.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `find_Volume(10,8,6)` would be 360.
