<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_Diff` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value.
The function checks if the remainder of `n` when divided by 11 is equal to 0.
If the remainder is 0, it means that `n` is divisible by 11 and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
<<<Output>>>
False
