 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_run_uppercase` takes a string as input and returns the maximum number of consecutive uppercase letters in the string.
The variable `cnt` is used to keep track of the current number of consecutive uppercase letters, and `res` is used to store the maximum number of consecutive uppercase letters found so far.
The function iterates through each character in the input string using a for loop.
If the current character is uppercase, `cnt` is incremented. Otherwise, `res` is updated with the current value of `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.
After the loop finishes, the function checks if the last character in the string is uppercase. If it is, `cnt` is added to `res` as the maximum number of consecutive uppercase letters found.
Finally, the function returns the maximum number of consecutive uppercase letters found.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `max_run_uppercase('GeMKSForGERksISBESt')` is 5.
The maximum number of consecutive uppercase letters in the string is "GEMKS".
