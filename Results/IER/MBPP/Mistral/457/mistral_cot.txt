<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Find_Min` takes a list of lists as input. It uses the built-in Python function `min` to find the minimum element in the list. The `key` parameter is used to specify a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the list. In this case, the `key` parameter is set to `len`, which means that the length of each list will be used as the comparison key.
The function returns the minimum element in the list, which is the list with the smallest length.
