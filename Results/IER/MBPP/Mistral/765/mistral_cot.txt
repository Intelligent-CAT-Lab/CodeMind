 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_polite` takes an integer `n` as input.
The first line of the function adds 1 to the input `n` and assigns the result back to `n`.
The second line of the function calculates the value of `(n + math.log(n, 2))` using the `math.log` function, which returns the natural logarithm of a number. The `math.log` function takes two arguments: the first is the base of the logarithm (which is 2 in this case), and the second is the number to log.
The third line of the function calculates the value of `(int)(n+(math.log((n + math.log(n, 2)), 2)))` by first adding the result of the second line to `n`, and then converting the result to an integer using the `int` function.
The final return value of the function is the integer value calculated in the third line.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `is_polite(7)` is 10.
