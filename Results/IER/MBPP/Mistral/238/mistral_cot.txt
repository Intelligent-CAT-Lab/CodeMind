 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and returns the number of substrings of that string.
The length of the string is calculated using the built-in `len()` function and stored in the variable `str_len`.
The formula used to calculate the number of substrings is `(str_len * (str_len + 1)) / 2`.
This formula works by considering each character in the string as the start of a substring. For example, the first character "a" is the start of the substring "a". The second character "b" is the start of the substring "b" and also the start of the substring "ab". The third character "c" is the start of the substring "c" and also the start of the substring "ac" and "bc". The formula calculates the total number of substrings by adding one to the length of the string and then multiplying by two, and then dividing by two.
