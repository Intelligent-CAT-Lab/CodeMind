<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_charac` takes a string `str1` as input.
It initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will be used to count the number of characters in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string `str1`.
For each character, it increments the `total` variable by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `total`, which is the number of characters in the string.
<<<Output>>>
