 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `geometric_sum` takes an integer `n` as input.
The function first checks if `n` is less than 0, in which case it returns 0.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of the geometric sum using the formula `1 / (2^n) + geometric_sum(n-1)`.
The formula calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of the geometric sequence with first term 1 and common ratio 2.
The function then recursively calls itself with the argument `n-1`, and adds the result to the current term.
The function continues this process until it reaches the base case, where `n=0`, and the function returns 1.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `geometric_sum(7)` is 0.00000000000000001.
