<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_aggregate` takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains a name and their corresponding marks.
The function uses a defaultdict to store the marks of each name.
It iterates through the list of tuples and for each tuple, it adds the marks to the corresponding name in the defaultdict.
After the iteration, it returns the maximum value in the defaultdict using the `max` function and a lambda function as the key.
The lambda function returns the second element of each tuple in the defaultdict, which is the marks.
