 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments, A and x. A is a list of integers and x is an integer.
The function initializes two variables, left and right, to 0 and len(A)-1, respectively.
The variable result is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the index of the first occurrence of x in A.
The function enters a while loop that continues until left is greater than right.
Inside the loop, it calculates the mid index by taking the average of left and right.
If x is equal to A[mid], it sets result to mid and right to mid-1.
If x is less than A[mid], it sets right to mid-1.
If x is greater than A[mid], it sets left to mid+1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the function is 4, which is the index of the first occurrence of 5 in the list [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9].
