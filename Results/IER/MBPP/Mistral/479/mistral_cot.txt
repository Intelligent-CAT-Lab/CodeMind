 <<<Analysis>>>
The function first_Digit takes an integer n as input.
The code starts by checking if n is greater than or equal to 10. If it is, it divides n by 10 and assigns the result back to n. This process continues until n is less than 10.
The while loop continues until n is less than 10, which means that the first digit of n is the last digit to be divided by 10.
The function then returns the value of n, which is the first digit of the input number.
