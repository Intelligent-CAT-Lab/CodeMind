 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions and constants.
The function next\_Perfect\_Square takes an integer N as input and returns the next perfect square that is greater than or equal to N.
The code first calculates the square root of N using the math.sqrt() function and then rounds it down to the nearest integer using the math.floor() function.
It then adds 1 to the result to get the next perfect square.
Finally, it multiplies the result by itself to get the final value.
