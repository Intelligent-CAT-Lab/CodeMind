 <<<Analysis>>>
The function min_Swaps takes two input strings, str1 and str2. It initializes a variable count to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of swaps required.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of str1. For each character i in str1, it checks if it is different from the corresponding character in str2. If it is, it increments the count by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the count is even or odd. If it is even, it divides the count by 2 and returns the result. If it is odd, it returns the string "Not Possible".
In this case, the count is 2, which is even, so the function divides it by 2 and returns 1.
