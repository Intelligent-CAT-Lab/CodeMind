<<<Analysis>>>
The function dif_Square takes an integer n as input.
The code checks if n is divisible by 4 and if the remainder is not equal to 2.
If the remainder is not equal to 2, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
For example, when n is 5, the remainder of 5 divided by 4 is 1, which is not equal to 2. Therefore, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
