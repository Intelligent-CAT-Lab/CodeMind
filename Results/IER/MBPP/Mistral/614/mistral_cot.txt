 <<<Analysis>>>
The function cummulative_sum takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple represents a set of numbers.
The function first uses the built-in sum function to calculate the sum of each set of numbers in the list.
It then uses the built-in map function to apply the sum function to each set of numbers in the list.
Finally, it uses the built-in sum function again to calculate the cumulative sum of all the sets of numbers in the list.
The function returns the cumulative sum.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of cummulative_sum([(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)]) is 24.
