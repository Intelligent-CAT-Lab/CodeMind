 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_dissimilar` takes two tuples as input, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. It first creates a new tuple `res` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the sets of the elements of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
The bitwise XOR operation returns 0 if the corresponding bits in the operands are the same and 1 if they are different.
The sets are used to remove any duplicates from the tuples, so that the resulting tuple will contain only the elements that are unique to one of the input tuples.
Finally, the function returns the resulting tuple `res`.
