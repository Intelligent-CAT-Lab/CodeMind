 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the itertools module and defines a function called find_combinations that takes a list of tuples as input.
The function uses the combinations function from itertools to generate all pairs of tuples from the input list.
For each pair of tuples, it calculates the sum of the first element of each tuple and the sum of the second element of each tuple.
It then stores these sums in a list called res.
Finally, the function returns the list of sums.
