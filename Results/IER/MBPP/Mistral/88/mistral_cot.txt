 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the `collections` module, which contains a `Counter` class that can be used to count the frequency of elements in a collection.
The `freq_count` function takes a list `list1` as input and returns a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in the list.
The `Counter` object is created by calling the `Counter` constructor on the input list `list1`.
The `Counter` object is then returned as the output of the function.
<<<Output>>>
Counter({10: 4, 20: 3, 30: 1, 40: 2, 50: 2})
