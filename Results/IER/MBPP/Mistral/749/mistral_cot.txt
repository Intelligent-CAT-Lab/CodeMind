The function `sort_numeric_strings` takes a list of strings as input. It first converts each string in the list to an integer using the built-in `int()` function. The resulting list of integers is stored in the variable `result`.
The `result` list is then sorted using the built-in `sort()` function.
Finally, the sorted list is returned as the output of the function.
