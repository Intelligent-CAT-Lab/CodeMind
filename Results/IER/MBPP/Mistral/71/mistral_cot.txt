 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `comb_sort` takes a list of numbers as input.
It initializes several variables:
- `shrink_fact` is set to 1.3, which will be used to shrink the gap size in each iteration.
- `gaps` is set to the length of the input list, which will be used to determine the size of the gap in each iteration.
- `swapped` is set to True, which will be used to keep track of whether any swaps were made in the current iteration.
- `i` is set to 0, which will be used as the starting index for the inner loop.
The function then enters a while loop that continues until the gap size is less than or equal to 1 or no swaps were made in the current iteration.
Inside the while loop, the gap size is shrunk by dividing it by the shrink factor.
Then, the inner loop is executed, which iterates from the starting index i to the end of the list, with a gap size of gaps + i.
For each element in the list, it checks if the element is greater than the next element with a gap size of gaps + i. If it is, it swaps the two elements.
After the inner loop finishes, the function checks if any swaps were made in the current iteration. If so, it sets swapped to True.
The while loop continues until the gap size is less than or equal to 1 or no swaps were made in the current iteration.
Finally, the function returns the sorted list.
