 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `pair_wise` takes a list `l1` as input.
It initializes an empty list `temp` to store pairs of adjacent elements in `l1`.
The function then iterates over the list `l1` using a for loop that starts at index 0 and ends at index `len(l1) - 1`.
For each iteration, it assigns the current element `current_element` to the first element of the pair and the next element `next_element` to the second element of the pair.
It then creates a tuple `x` containing the pair of adjacent elements and appends it to the `temp` list.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the `temp` list, which contains pairs of adjacent elements in `l1`.
<<<Output>>>
[(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)]
