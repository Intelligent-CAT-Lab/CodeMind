 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of cubes of numbers from 1 to n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider the number 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the cube of the number and adds it to sum. The cube of 1 is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the average of the sum by dividing it by n, which is 2. The average is 1.
The code then rounds the average to 6 decimal places using the round() function. The result is 1.000000.
<<<Output>>>
1.000000
