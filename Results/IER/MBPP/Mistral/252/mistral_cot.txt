<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the cmath module, which provides complex number operations.
The function convert takes a list of numbers as input.
The function converts each number in the list to its polar representation using the cmath.polar() function.
The function returns the list of polar numbers.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `convert(1)` would be a list containing the polar representation of the number 1, which is (0, 1).
