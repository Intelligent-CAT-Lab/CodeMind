 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_ludic` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of integers.
The function first initializes an empty list `ludics`.
It then iterates from 1 to n+1 and appends each integer to the list `ludics`.
The function then enters a while loop that continues until the index `index` is equal to the length of the list `ludics`.
Inside the while loop, it first removes the first element of the list `ludics` and stores it in the variable `first_ludic`.
It then calculates the remove index as `index + first_ludic`.
It then enters another while loop that continues until the remove index is greater than or equal to the length of the list `ludics`.
Inside this loop, it removes the element at the remove index from the list `ludics` and updates the remove index as `remove_index + first_ludic - 1`.
After both while loops finish, the function returns the list `ludics`.
