<<<Analysis>>>
The function `armstrong_number` takes an integer `number` as input.
The variable `sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of digits raised to the power of their position.
The variable `times` is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the power of each digit.
The variable `temp` is initialized to the input number `number`.
The first while loop iterates until `temp` is greater than 0. It increments `times` by 1 and divides `temp` by 10.
The second while loop iterates until `temp` is greater than 0. It calculates the remainder of `temp` divided by 10, which gives the last digit of the number. It then raises this digit to the power of `times` and adds it to the `sum`. It then divides `temp` by 10.
After both while loops finish, the code checks if the `sum` is equal to the input number `number`. If it is, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
