 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: arr, which is a list of integers, and n, which is the length of the list.
The variable j is initialized to 0 and will be used to keep track of the index of the first positive element in the list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each element in the list, it checks if it is less than 0. If it is, it swaps the current element with the element at index j.
The condition is met when the current element is -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8 and -9.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the modified list.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
