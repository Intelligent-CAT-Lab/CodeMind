 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_vowels` takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.
The variable `res` is initialized to 0 and will be used to count the number of vowels.
The variable `vow_list` is a list of vowels ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of the string - 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all characters in the string except the first and last characters.
For each character in this range, it checks if the character is not a vowel and if either the previous or next character is a vowel. If this condition is met, it increments the count of vowels.
After the loop finishes, the code checks the first and last characters of the string and increments the count of vowels if they are not vowels but their previous or next character is a vowel.
Finally, the code prints the final value of res, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
