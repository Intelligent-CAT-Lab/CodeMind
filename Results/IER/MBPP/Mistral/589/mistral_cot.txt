 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `perfect_squares` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns a list of all perfect squares between `a` and `b`.
The function starts by initializing an empty list called `lists`.
It then enters a loop that iterates from `a` to `b+1`.
For each number `i` in this range, it initializes a variable `j` to 1 and enters a while loop that continues until `j*j` is greater than `i`.
Inside the while loop, it checks if `j*j` is equal to `i`. If it is, it appends `i` to the `lists` list.
After the while loop finishes, it increments `i` and continues with the next iteration of the outer loop.
After the outer loop finishes, the function returns the `lists` list, which contains all perfect squares between `a` and `b`.
