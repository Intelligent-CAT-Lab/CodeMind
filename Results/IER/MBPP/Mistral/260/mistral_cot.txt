 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `newman_prime` takes an integer `n` as input.
The function first checks if `n` is 0 or 1, in which case it returns 1.
Otherwise, it returns 2 times the result of calling `newman_prime` with `n-1`, plus the result of calling `newman_prime` with `n-2`.
This is a recursive function, meaning it calls itself until it reaches the base case of `n` being 0 or 1.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `newman_prime(3)` is 10.
