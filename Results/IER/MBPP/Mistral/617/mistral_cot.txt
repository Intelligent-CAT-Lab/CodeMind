 <<<Analysis>>>
The function min_Jumps takes two arguments: steps and d. The steps argument is a tuple of two integers a and b, representing the number of steps to take to reach the current position and the number of steps to take to reach the next position, respectively. The d argument is the number of steps to take to reach the destination.
The function first assigns the values of a and b to variables (a, b). It then assigns the value of temp to variable a. It then updates the values of a and b by assigning the minimum of a and b to a and the maximum of temp and b to b, respectively.
The function then checks if d is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it returns the value of (d + b - 1) / b. If d is 0, it returns 0. If d is equal to a, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 2.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of min_Jumps((3,4),11) is 2.
