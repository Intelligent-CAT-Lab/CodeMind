 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `concatenate_tuple` takes a tuple as input, in this case `("ID", "is", 4, "UTS")`.
The variable `delim` is set to "-".
The function uses the `join` method to concatenate the elements of the tuple with the delimiter "-".
The resulting string is then sliced to remove the last occurrence of the delimiter.
Finally, the function returns the string representation of the resulting string.
<<<Output>>>
"ID-is-4-UTS"
