<<<Analysis>>>
The function `text_match_three` takes a string `text` as input.
It uses regular expression `re` to search for the pattern `'ab{3}?'` in the input string `text`.
The pattern `'ab{3}?'` matches any sequence of three consecutive letters `abab` or `abac` or `abba`.
The `re.search()` function returns the first occurrence of the pattern in the input string, or `None` if the pattern is not found.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `text_match_three("ac")` is `None`, because the pattern `'ab{3}?'` is not found in the input string `"ac"`.
