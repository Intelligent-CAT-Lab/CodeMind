<<<Analysis>>>
The function `last_digit` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the last digit of the integer `n`.
The function uses the modulo operator `%` to find the remainder of the division of `n` by 10.
Since 10 is the last digit of the number 123, the remainder of 123 divided by 10 is 3, which is the last digit of 123.
<<<Output>>>
3
