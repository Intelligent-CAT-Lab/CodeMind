 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_element_in_list` takes two arguments: `list1` and `x`. `list1` is a list of lists, and `x` is an integer.
The variable `ctr` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of occurrences of `x` in the list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in `list1`. For each element, it checks if `x` is present in that element using the `in` keyword. If `x` is present, it increments the `ctr` variable by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ctr`, which is 2.
