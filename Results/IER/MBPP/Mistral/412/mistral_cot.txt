 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_odd` takes a list `l` as input.
It iterates over each element in the list using a for loop.
For each element, it checks if it is odd by using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder of dividing the element by 2 is not 0, it means the element is odd.
If the element is odd, it is removed from the list using the `remove()` method.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the modified list.
