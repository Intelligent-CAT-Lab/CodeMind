 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_dirty_chars` takes two arguments: `string` and `second_string`. It first calls the `get_char_count_array` function to count the number of occurrences of each character in the `second_string`. It then iterates through the `string` and checks if the current character is in the `second_string`. If it is not, it adds it to the result string. The function returns the result string.

For the given input `remove_dirty_chars("probasscurve", "pros")`, the function first calls `get_char_count_array` to count the number of occurrences of each character in "pros". It returns an array of length 256 with all elements set to 0.

The function then iterates through the input string "probasscurve". The first character 'p' is not in the second string "pros", so it is added to the result string. The second character 'o' is not in the second string, so it is added to the result string. The third character 'b' is not in the second string, so it is added to the result string. The fourth character 'a' is not in the second string, so it is added to the result string. The fifth character 's' is not in the second string, so it is added to the result string. The sixth character 's' is not in the second string, so it is added to the result string. The seventh character 'c' is not in the second string, so it is added to the result string. The eighth character 'u' is not in the second string, so it is added to the result string. The ninth character 'r' is not in the second string, so it is added to the result string. The tenth character 'v' is not in the second string, so it is added to the result string. The eleventh character 'e' is not in the second string, so it is added to the result string.

The function then returns the result string "probasscurve".
