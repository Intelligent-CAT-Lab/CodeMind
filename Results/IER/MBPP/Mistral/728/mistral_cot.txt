 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_list` takes two lists as input, `lst1` and `lst2`. It creates a new list `res_list` of the same length as `lst1`.
It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the range of the length of `lst1` and for each iteration, it adds the element of `lst1` at that index plus the element of `lst2` at that index to the `res_list`.
The final result is a new list with the sum of corresponding elements of `lst1` and `lst2`.
