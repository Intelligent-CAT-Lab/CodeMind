 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable ctr is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of prime numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5.
For each number num in this range, it checks if it is less than or equal to 1, and if so, it skips to the next iteration.
If num is not less than or equal to 1, it enters another loop that iterates from 2 to num (inclusive), meaning it will check if num is divisible by any number in this range.
If num is divisible by any number in this range, it breaks out of the inner loop.
If num is not divisible by any number in this range, it increments ctr.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ctr, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
