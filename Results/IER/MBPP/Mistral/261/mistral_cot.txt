 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `division_elements` takes two tuples as input, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over the corresponding elements of the two tuples.
For each pair of elements, it performs element-wise division using the `//` operator and stores the result in a new tuple `res`.
The resulting tuple `res` is then returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
(2, 2, 2, 2)
