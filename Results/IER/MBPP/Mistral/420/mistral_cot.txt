 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the cube of i and adds it to the variable sum.
The cube of 1 is 1, and the cube of 2 is 8.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
