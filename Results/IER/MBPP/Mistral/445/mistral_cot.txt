 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `index_multiplication` takes two tuples as input, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. It uses a nested loop to iterate over each element of the two tuples simultaneously. For each element in the first tuple, it multiplies it with the corresponding element in the second tuple and stores the result in a new tuple. The resulting tuple is then zipped with the next element in the second tuple and the resulting tuple is added to a new tuple called `res`.
The function then returns `res`, which is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple is the product of the corresponding elements in the input tuples.
