<<<Analysis>>>
The function `diff_even_odd` takes a list as input. It uses the `next` function to find the first even and first odd number in the list. If a number is not found, it returns -1.
The function then returns the difference between the first even and first odd number.
For the input `[1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8]`, the first even number is 4 and the first odd number is 3. Therefore, the function returns `4-3=1`.
