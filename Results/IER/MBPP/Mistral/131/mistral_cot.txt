 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and returns a new string.
The first step is to create an empty string called vowels.
Then, it iterates through each character in the input string str1.
If the character is a vowel, it is added to the vowels string.
After the loop finishes, the function creates an empty string called result_string.
It then iterates through each character in the input string str1 again.
If the character is a vowel, it adds the last character of the vowels string to the result_string.
Then, it removes the last character of the vowels string.
If the character is not a vowel, it adds the character to the result_string.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the result_string.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `reverse_vowels("Python")` is "thPnoy".
