 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `multiply_elements` takes a tuple as input, in this case `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`.
The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of the tuple, and for each pair of elements, it multiplies them and adds the result to a new tuple called `res`.
The resulting tuple `res` is then returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
(5, 35, 70, 280, 400)
