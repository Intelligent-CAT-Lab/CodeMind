 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_Occurrence` takes two arguments: a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`.
The variable `count` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of occurrences.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each item in the tuple `tup`.
For each item, it checks if it is in the list `lst`. If it is, it increments the count by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of count, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
