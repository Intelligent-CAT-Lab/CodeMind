 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.
It then defines a function `sort_counter` that takes a dictionary as input.
The function creates a `Counter` object from the input dictionary using the `Counter` class.
The `most_common()` method is then called on the `Counter` object, which returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the input dictionary, sorted in descending order of their values.
The function then returns the sorted list of tuples.
