 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `split_Arr` takes two arguments: `l` and `n`. `l` is a list and `n` is an integer.
The function returns the concatenation of the sublist `l[n:]` (starting from index `n` and going to the end of the list) and the sublist `l[:n]` (starting from the beginning of the list and going up to index `n-1`).
In other words, it splits the list `l` into two parts, the first `n` elements and the rest of the elements.
For the input `[12,10,5,6,52,36]` and `n=2`, the function will return the concatenation of `[12,10,5,6]` and `[52,36]`, which is `[12,10,5,6,52,36]`.
<<<Output>>>
[12, 10, 5, 6, 52, 36]
