 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `lcs_of_three` takes three input strings `X`, `Y`, and `Z` and returns the length of their Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).
The function first initializes three variables `m`, `n`, and `o` to the lengths of the input strings.
It then initializes a 3D array `L` of size `(m+1) x (n+1) x (o+1)` with all elements set to 0.
The function then iterates through each character in the input strings and compares them to find the LCS.
For each character, it checks if it is the same in all three strings. If it is, it adds 1 to the LCS length and updates the corresponding element in the 3D array `L`.
If it is not the same in all three strings, it updates the LCS length by taking the maximum of the LCS length of the two adjacent strings.
Finally, the function returns the LCS length stored in the last element of the 3D array `L`.
For the input `'AGGT12', '12TXAYB', '12XBA'`, the LCS is `'AGT'`.
