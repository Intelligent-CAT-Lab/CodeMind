 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_length` takes a list of lists as input. It uses two different approaches to find the maximum length of a list and the maximum element in a list.
The first approach uses a generator expression to create a sequence of lengths of all the lists in the input list. The `max` function is then used to find the maximum value in this sequence.
The second approach uses another generator expression to create a sequence of all the elements in the input list. The `max` function is then used to find the maximum value in this sequence.
The function returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the maximum element.
