 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `rgb_to_hsv` takes three arguments, `r`, `g`, and `b`, which represent the red, green, and blue values of a color, respectively.
The function first divides each of these values by 255.0 to convert them to a decimal value between 0 and 1.
The function then calculates the maximum and minimum values of the three input values, which are stored in the variables `mx` and `mn`, respectively.
The function then calculates the difference between `mx` and `mn`, which is stored in the variable `df`.
The function then checks if `mx` is equal to `mn`. If it is, the function sets the value of `h` to 0.
If `mx` is not equal to `mn`, the function then checks which of the three input values is equal to `mx`. The function sets the value of `h` based on which input value is equal to `mx`.
The function then calculates the saturation (`s`) and value (`v`) of the color based on the formula `s = (df/mx)*100` and `v = mx*100`, respectively.
Finally, the function returns the values of `h`, `s`, and `v`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `rgb_to_hsv(255, 255, 255)` is (0, 0, 100).
