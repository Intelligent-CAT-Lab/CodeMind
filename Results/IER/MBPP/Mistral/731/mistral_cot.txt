 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `lateralsurface_cone` takes two arguments, `r` and `h`, which represent the radius and height of a cone, respectively.
The function calculates the lateral surface area of the cone using the formula `LSA = pi * r * l`, where `l` is the slant height of the cone.
The slant height `l` is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, `l = sqrt(r^2 + h^2)`.
The function then returns the calculated lateral surface area.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `lateralsurface_cone(5,12)` is 156.25.
