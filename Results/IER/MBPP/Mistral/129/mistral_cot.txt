 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a 2D list as input, which is a magic square.
The function first calculates the sum of each row, column and diagonal of the magic square and stores them in a list called sum_list.
It then calculates the sum of the two diagonals and adds them to the sum_list.
The function then checks if the set of sum_list contains more than one element. If it does, it means the magic square is not valid and the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
