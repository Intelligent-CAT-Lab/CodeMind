 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `start_withp` takes a list of words as input. It then iterates over each word in the list.
For each word, it uses the `re.match` function to search for a pattern in the word. The pattern is "(P\w+)\W(P\w+)", which matches a string that starts with "P", followed by one or more word characters, then a non-word character, then another string that starts with "P", followed by one or more word characters.
If a match is found, the function returns the groups of the match, which are the two strings that match the pattern.
If no match is found, the function returns `None`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `start_withp(["Python PHP", "Java JavaScript", "c c++"])` is `[('Python', 'PHP'), ('Java', 'JavaScript'), ('c', 'c++')]`.
