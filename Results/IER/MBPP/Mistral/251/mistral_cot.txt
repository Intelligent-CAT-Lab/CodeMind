 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `insert_element` takes two arguments: a list and an element to be inserted.
The function creates a new list by using a list comprehension to iterate over the original list and insert the new element in between each element.
The resulting list is then returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
['Red', 'c', 'Green', 'Black']
