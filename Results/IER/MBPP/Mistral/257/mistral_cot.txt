<<<Analysis>>>
The function `swap_numbers` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are 10 and 20 respectively.
The function initializes a temporary variable `temp` to the value of `a`, which is 10.
Then, the value of `a` is set to the value of `b`, which is 20.
The value of `b` is then set to the value of `temp`, which is 10.
Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the new values of `a` and `b`, which are (20, 10).
<<<Output>>>
(20, 10)
