 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_same_pair` takes two lists as input, `nums1` and `nums2`. It uses the `map` function to apply the `eq` operator to each pair of elements in the two lists. The `eq` operator returns `True` if the two operands are equal and `False` otherwise. The `sum` function then adds up all the `True` values returned by the `map` function.
The return value of the function is the sum of the number of pairs of elements that are equal in both lists.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `count_same_pair([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],[2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9])` is 3.
This is because there are three pairs of elements that are equal in both lists: (1, 2), (2, 2) and (6, 6).
