<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_perfect_square` takes an integer `n` as input.
The variable `i` is initialized to 1 and enters a while loop that continues until `i * i` is greater than `n`.
Inside the loop, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `i` and if the division of `n` by `i` is equal to `i`. If both conditions are met, it means that `n` is a perfect square and the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding a perfect square, the function returns `False`.
<<<Output>>>
False
