 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `unique_product` takes a list of integers as input.
It first converts the list to a set, which removes any duplicate values.
It then converts the set back to a list and stores it in the variable `temp`.
The variable `p` is initialized to 1 and then multiplied by each element in `temp`.
Finally, the function returns the value of `p`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `unique_product([10, 20, 30, 40, 20, 50, 60, 40])` is 120.
This is because the unique product of the numbers in the list is 10 x 20 x 30 x 40 x 50 x 60 x 40 = 120.
