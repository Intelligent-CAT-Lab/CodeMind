 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `unique_sublists` takes a list of lists as input. It first initializes an empty dictionary `result`. It then iterates over each list in the input list using a for loop. For each list, it creates a tuple of its elements and uses the `setdefault` method of the dictionary to add it as a key if it doesn't already exist. If it does exist, it appends 1 to the corresponding list of the dictionary.
After the loop finishes, it iterates over the dictionary using another for loop and calculates the sum of each list in the dictionary. It stores the sum in the dictionary using the key of the list.
Finally, it returns the dictionary.
