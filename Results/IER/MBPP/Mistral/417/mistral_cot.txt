 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `group_tuples` takes a list of tuples as input. It initializes an empty dictionary `out`. It then iterates over each tuple in the input list. For each tuple, it tries to access the first element as a key in the dictionary `out`. If the key already exists, it appends the rest of the tuple to the corresponding list in the dictionary. If the key does not exist, it creates a new list containing the tuple and adds it to the dictionary with the first element as the key.
After the loop finishes, the function converts the dictionary `out` to a list of lists, where each inner list contains the tuples with the same first element. It returns this list of lists.
<<<Output>>>
