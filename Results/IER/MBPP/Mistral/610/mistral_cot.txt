 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_kth_element` takes two arguments: `list1` and `L`. `list1` is a list of integers and `L` is an integer representing the kth element to be removed.
The function returns a new list that contains all elements of `list1` except the kth element.
The function first uses slicing to split the list into two parts: the first `L-1` elements and the remaining elements after the `L-1`th element.
It then concatenates these two parts using the `+` operator to create a new list that contains all elements of `list1` except the kth element.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `remove_kth_element([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)` is `[1,1,2,3,4,5]`.
This is because the kth element to be removed is the 4th element, which is 4. So the function returns a new list that contains all elements of the original list except the 4th element, resulting in `[1,1,2,3,5]`.
