 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `odd_Equivalent` takes two arguments: `s` and `n`. `s` is a string of length `n`, which represents the input string. The function iterates through each character in the string `s` and checks if it is equal to '1'. If it is, the count is incremented by 1.
The function returns the count of the number of '1's in the string `s`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `odd_Equivalent("011001",6)` is 3.
The string "011001" has 3 '1's in it.
