The function `tuple_to_int` takes a tuple as input and converts it to an integer by concatenating its elements and converting the concatenated string to an integer.
The function first converts each element of the tuple to a string using the `str()` function.
Then it uses the `map()` function to apply the `str()` function to each element of the tuple.
The resulting list of strings is then concatenated using the `join()` method of the string class.
Finally, the concatenated string is converted to an integer using the `int()` function.
The function returns the resulting integer.
