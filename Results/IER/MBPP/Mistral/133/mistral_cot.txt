 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_negativenum` takes a list of numbers as input.
It uses the built-in `filter` function to create a new list that contains only the negative numbers from the input list.
The `filter` function takes a lambda function as an argument, which checks if the number is less than 0.
The resulting list is then passed to the built-in `sum` function, which calculates the sum of all the numbers in the list.
The final result is returned by the function.
