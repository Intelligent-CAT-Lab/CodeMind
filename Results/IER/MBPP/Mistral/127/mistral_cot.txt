 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `multiply_int` takes two arguments, `x` and `y`.
The function first checks if `y` is less than 0. If it is, the function returns the negative of the result of calling `multiply_int` with `x` and `-y`.
If `y` is 0, the function returns 0.
If `y` is 1, the function returns `x`.
If `y` is greater than 1, the function returns `x` plus the result of calling `multiply_int` with `x` and `y - 1`.
In this case, `x` is 10 and `y` is 20.
Since `y` is greater than 1, the function returns 10 plus the result of calling `multiply_int` with 10 and 20 - 1, which is 19.
