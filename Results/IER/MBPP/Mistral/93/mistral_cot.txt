<<<Analysis>>>
The function power takes two arguments, a and b.
The function checks if b is equal to 0, in which case it returns 1.
If a is equal to 0, it returns 0.
If b is equal to 1, it returns the value of a.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it returns the value of a multiplied by the result of calling the function power with the arguments a and b-1.
In this case, a is 3 and b is 4.
The function first checks if b is equal to 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
It then checks if a is equal to 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
It then checks if b is equal to 1, which it is not, so it moves on to the final condition.
The final condition is met, so the function returns 3 multiplied by the result of calling the function power with the arguments 3 and 3-1, which is 2.
