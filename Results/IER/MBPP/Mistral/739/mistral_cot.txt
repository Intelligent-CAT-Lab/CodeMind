 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions and constants.
The function find_Index takes a single argument n, which is an integer.
The function calculates the value of x using the formula x = sqrt(2 * 10^(n-1))
The function then rounds the value of x to the nearest integer using the round() function.
The return value of the function is the rounded value of x.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the function find_Index(2) would be 2.
