 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `issort_list` takes a list as input and returns a boolean value.
The function uses the built-in `all` function to check if all elements in the list are sorted in ascending order.
The `all` function returns `True` if all elements in the list satisfy the condition, and `False` otherwise.
The condition is met when all elements in the list are less than or equal to the next element.
In this case, the list is [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17].
Since 1 is less than or equal to 2, 2 is less than or equal to 4, 4 is less than or equal to 6, 6 is less than or equal to 8, 8 is less than or equal to 10, 10 is less than or equal to 12, 12 is less than or equal to 14, 14 is less than or equal to 16, 16 is less than or equal to 17.
Therefore, the return value of the function is `True`, indicating that the list is sorted in ascending order.
