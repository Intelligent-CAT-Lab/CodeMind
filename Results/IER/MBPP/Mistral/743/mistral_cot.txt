 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: a list and an integer m.
The function first creates an empty list called result.
Then it uses slicing to extract the last m elements of the list and concatenates them with the first -m elements of the list.
The resulting list is then returned as the result.
In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and m is 3.
So the function will extract the last 3 elements of the list, which are [7, 8, 9], and concatenate them with the first -3 elements of the list, which are [1, 2, 3].
The resulting list is [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9]
