<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_Abs_Diff` takes an array `arr` as input. The length of the array is stored in the variable `n`. The two variables `minEle` and `maxEle` are initialized to the first element of the array.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the second element to the last element of the array (inclusive).
For each element in the array, it updates the minimum and maximum values by selecting the smaller and larger values, respectively.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values and returns it.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3))` is 10.
