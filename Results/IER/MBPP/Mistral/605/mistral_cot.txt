 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `prime_num` takes an integer `num` as input.
The function first checks if `num` is greater than or equal to 1. If it is not, it returns `False`.
If `num` is greater than or equal to 1, the function enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `num//2`.
For each number `i` in this range, it checks if `num` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it returns `False`. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration.
If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the function returns `True`.
<<<Output>>>
True
