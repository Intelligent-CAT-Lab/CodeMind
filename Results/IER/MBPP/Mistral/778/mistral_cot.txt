 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `pack_consecutive_duplicates` takes a list as input and returns a list of lists.
It uses the `groupby` function from the `itertools` module to group the elements of the input list based on their consecutive values.
The `groupby` function returns an iterator of groups, where each group is a tuple of the form (key, group), where key is the first element of the group and group is the list of elements in the group.
The function then converts each group tuple to a list using the `list` function and returns a list of these lists.
For the input list `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]`, the function groups the elements as follows:
- [0, 0]
- [1]
- [2]
- [3]
- [4]
- [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
- [5]
- [6]
- [6]
- [6]
- [7]
- [8]
- [9]
The function then converts each group tuple to a list and returns a list of these lists, which is `[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [5], [6], [6], [6], [7], [8], [9]]`.

[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [5], [6], [6], [6], [7], [8], [9]]
