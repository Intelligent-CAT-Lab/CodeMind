The function `extract_values` takes a string as input and returns a list of all the values found in the string.
The function uses the `re.findall` method to find all occurrences of the pattern `r'"(.*?)"'` in the input string.
The pattern `r'"(.*?)"'` matches any string enclosed in double quotes, where the `.*?` inside the quotes matches any characters (except newline) between 0 and unlimited times, non-greedily.
So, in the input string `"Python", "PHP", "Java"`, the pattern `r'"(.*?)"'` matches the three strings inside the quotes.
The `re.findall` method returns a list of all the matches found, which is then returned by the function `extract_values`.
<<<Output>>>
['Python', 'PHP', 'Java']
