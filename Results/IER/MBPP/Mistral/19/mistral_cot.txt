 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `test_duplicate` takes an input `arraynums`, which is a list of integers.
The function first creates a set of the elements in the list using the `set()` function.
The set function removes any duplicate values from the list.
The function then checks if the length of the original list is not equal to the length of the set.
If the length of the original list is not equal to the length of the set, it means that there are duplicate values in the list.
In this case, the input list `arraynums` is `([1,2,3,4,5])`, which has no duplicate values.
Therefore, the length of the original list is equal to the length of the set.
The function returns `False` because the condition `len(arraynums) != len(nums_set)` is not met.
<<<Output>>>
False
