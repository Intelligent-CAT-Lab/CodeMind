 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_Parity` takes an integer `x` as input and returns a boolean value.
The function first calculates the value of `y` by performing a series of bitwise XOR operations on `x` and shifting it to the right by 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 bits, respectively.
The final value of `y` is then checked to see if it is odd by performing a bitwise AND operation with 1. If the result is 1, the function returns True, indicating that the number `x` has an odd number of bits.
If the result is 0, the function returns False, indicating that the number `x` has an even number of bits.
<<<Output>>>
