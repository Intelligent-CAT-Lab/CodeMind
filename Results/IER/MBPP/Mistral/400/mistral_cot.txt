 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_freq` takes a list of tuples as input. It first converts the list of tuples to a set of tuples using the built-in set function. Then it applies a lambda function to each tuple in the set, which converts the tuple to a tuple of sorted values. This results in a list of tuples of sorted values.
The function then applies the built-in len function to the list of tuples of sorted values, which returns the number of unique elements in the list.
The final return value is the length of the list of tuples of sorted values.
