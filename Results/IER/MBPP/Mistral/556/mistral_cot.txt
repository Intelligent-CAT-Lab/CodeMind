 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_Odd_Pair` takes two arguments: `A` which is a list of integers and `N` which is the length of the list.
The variable `oddPair` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of odd pairs found.
The code then enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all elements in the list.
For each element i in this range, the inner loop iterates from i+1 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all elements after i.
For each pair of elements (i,j), the code checks if their XOR (exclusive OR) is odd. If it is, it increments the `oddPair` variable.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of `oddPair`, which is 2.
