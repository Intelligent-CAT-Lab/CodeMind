<<<Analysis>>>
The function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer `n` as input and returns its binary representation as a string.
The function uses the built-in `bin()` function to convert the decimal number to binary. The `bin()` function returns a string that starts with "0b" to indicate that it is a binary string.
The `replace()` method is then used to remove the "0b" prefix from the binary string.
So, when `decimal_to_binary(8)` is called, the function first converts the decimal number 8 to binary using the `bin()` function, which returns the string "1000". Then it removes the "0b" prefix using the `replace()` method, resulting in the final string "1000".
<<<Output>>>
1000
