The function `div_sum` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its divisors. It uses a while loop to iterate over all possible divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n`. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator `%`. If it is, it adds `i` and the floor of `n/i` to the total sum.
The function `are_equivalent` takes two integers `num1` and `num2` as input and returns `True` if their divisor sums are equal, and `False` otherwise. It calls the `div_sum` function for both `num1` and `num2` and compares the results.
For the input `(36, 57)`, the `div_sum` function will first check if 36 is divisible by any number up to its square root, which is 6. Since 36 is not divisible by any number up to 6, the function will continue to the next iteration. In the next iteration, the function will check if 57 is divisible by any number up to its square root, which is 7. Since 57 is not divisible by any number up to 7, the function will continue to the next iteration. In the next iteration, the function will check if 36 is divisible by any number up to its square root, which is 6. Since 36 is not divisible by any number up to 6, the function will continue to the next iteration. In the next iteration, the function will check if 57 is divisible by any number up to its square root, which is 7. Since 57 is not divisible by any number up to 7, the function will continue to the next iteration. In the next iteration, the function will check if 36 is divisible by any number up to its square root, which is 6. Since 36 is not divisible by any number up to 6, the function will continue to the next iteration. In the next iteration, the function will check if 57 is divisible by any number up to its square root, which is 7. Since 57 is not divisible by any number up to 7, the function will continue to the next iteration. In the next iteration, the function will check if 36 is divisible by any number up to its square root, which is 6. Since 36 is not divisible by any number up to 6, the function will continue to the next iteration. In the next iteration, the function will check if 57 is divisible by any number up to its square root, which is 7. Since 57 is not divisible by any number up to 7, the function will continue to the next iteration. In the next iteration, the function will check if 36 is divisible by any number up to its square root, which is 6. Since 36 is not divisible by any number up to 6, the function will continue to the next iteration. In the next iteration, the function will check if 57 is divisible by any number up to its square root, which is 7. Since 57 is not divisible by any number up to 7, the function will continue to the next iteration. In the next iteration, the function will check if 36 is divisible by any number up to its square root, which
