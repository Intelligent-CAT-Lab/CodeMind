 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_literals` takes two arguments: `text` and `pattern`.
The `text` argument is a string that contains the text to search for the pattern in.
The `pattern` argument is a string that represents the pattern to search for in the text.
The function uses the `re` module to search for the pattern in the text using the `re.search()` function.
The `re.search()` function returns a `Match` object, which contains information about the match, including the start and end positions of the match in the text.
The function then returns a tuple containing the pattern, the start position, and the end position of the match.
