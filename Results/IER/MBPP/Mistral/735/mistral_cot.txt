 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `toggle_middle_bits` takes an integer `n` as input.
It first checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, it returns 1. Otherwise, it applies a bitwise XOR operation with the result of calling the function `set_middle_bits(n)`.
The function `set_middle_bits` takes an integer `n` as input and applies a series of bitwise OR operations with shifted versions of `n`. The purpose of this is to set the middle bits of the number to 1.
The function then returns the result of shifting the bits of the number one position to the right and performing a bitwise XOR operation with 1.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `toggle_middle_bits(9)` is 19.
