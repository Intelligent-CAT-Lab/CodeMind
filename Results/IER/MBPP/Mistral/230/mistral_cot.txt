<<<Analysis>>>
The function `replace_blank` takes two arguments: `str1` and `char`. `str1` is a string and `char` is a character.
The function uses the `replace()` method of the string class to replace all occurrences of the space character in `str1` with the character `char`.
The resulting string is stored in `str2` and returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `replace_blank("hello people",'@')` is `"hello@people"`.
