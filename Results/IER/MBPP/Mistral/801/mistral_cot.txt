 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `test_three_equal` takes three arguments, `x`, `y`, and `z`.
It creates a set of these three values and stores it in the variable `result`.
The function then checks if the length of `result` is equal to 3. If it is, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns 4 minus the length of `result`.
In this case, `x`, `y`, and `z` are all equal to 1. So the set `{1,1,1}` has a length of 3.
Since the length of the set is equal to 3, the function returns 0.
