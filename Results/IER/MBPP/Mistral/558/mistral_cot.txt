<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments, n1 and n2, which are integers.
The function first calculates the absolute difference between n1 and n2 using the abs() function.
It then converts this absolute difference to a string using the str() function.
The function then uses the map() function to convert each digit in the string to an integer.
Finally, the function uses the sum() function to add up all the integers obtained from the map() function.
The return value of the function is the sum of the absolute differences between the digits of n1 and n2.
