The function `find_lucas` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
The function first checks if `n` is 0 or 1, in which case it returns 2 or 1, respectively.
Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `n - 1` and `n - 2`, and adds the results together.
For example, when `n` is 2, the function calls itself with `n - 1` (which is 1) and `n - 2` (which is 0), and returns 1 + 0 = 1.
When `n` is 3, the function calls itself with `n - 1` (which is 2) and `n - 2` (which is 1), and returns 2 + 1 = 3.
When `n` is 4, the function calls itself with `n - 1` (which is 3) and `n - 2` (which is 2), and returns 3 + 2 = 5.
When `n` is 5, the function calls itself with `n - 1` (which is 4) and `n - 2` (which is 3), and returns 5 + 3 = 8.
When `n` is 6, the function calls itself with `n - 1` (which is 5) and `n - 2` (which is 4), and returns 8 + 4 = 12.
When `n` is 7, the function calls itself with `n - 1` (which is 6) and `n - 2` (which is 5), and returns 12 + 5 = 17.
When `n` is 8, the function calls itself with `n - 1` (which is 7) and `n - 2` (which is 6), and returns 17 + 6 = 23.
When `n` is 9, the function calls itself with `n - 1` (which is 8) and `n - 2` (which is 7), and returns 23 + 7 = 30.
Therefore, the return value of `find_lucas(9)` is 30.
