<<<Analysis>>>
The function `next_power_of_2` takes an integer `n` as input.
The first `if` statement checks if `n` is not 0 and if `n` is not equal to `n - 1`. If both conditions are true, it means that `n` is a power of 2 and the function returns `n`.
If the `if` statement is not true, the function enters a `while` loop that repeatedly shifts the value of `n` to the right by 1 bit until it becomes 0. The number of bits shifted is stored in the variable `count`.
Finally, the function returns the value of 1 shifted to the left by `count` bits, which is the next power of 2 greater than `n`.
For the input `0`, the function first checks the `if` statement, which is not true. Therefore, it enters the `while` loop and shifts `n` to the right by 1 bit until it becomes 0. This means that `count` is 0.
The function then returns the value of 1 shifted to the left by 0 bits, which is 1.
