<<<Analysis>>>
The function `centered_hexagonal_number` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the value of the formula `3 * n * (n - 1) + 1`.
The formula calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is the number of hexagonal numbers with side length `n`.
The function then adds 1 to this sum to get the final value of the centered hexagonal number.
<<<Output>>>
34
