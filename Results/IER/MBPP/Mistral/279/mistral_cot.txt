<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_num_decagonal` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value.
The function calculates the value of `4 * n * n - 3 * n` and returns `True` if the result is equal to 0, otherwise it returns `False`.
The value of `4 * n * n - 3 * n` is a perfect square if and only if `n` is a decagonal number, which means that the sum of its digits is equal to the square of the number of digits.
For example, 3 is a decagonal number because 3 + 3 = 6, which is the square of 2.
<<<Output>>>
False
