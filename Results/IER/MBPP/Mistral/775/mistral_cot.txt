 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `odd_position` takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value.
The function uses a list comprehension to check if each element in the list is odd or even.
The list comprehension checks if the remainder of the element divided by 2 is equal to the remainder of the index divided by 2.
If the remainder is the same, it means that the element is in an odd position and the list comprehension returns True.
If the remainder is different, it means that the element is in an even position and the list comprehension returns False.
The function returns True if all elements in the list are in odd positions and False otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
False
