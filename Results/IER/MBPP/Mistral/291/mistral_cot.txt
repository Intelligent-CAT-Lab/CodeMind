 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_no_of_ways` takes two arguments, `n` and `k`. `n` is the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements, and `k` is the number of elements to choose.
The function initializes an array `dp` of size `n+1` with all elements set to 0. It also initializes two variables `total` and `mod`. `total` is set to `k`, which is 4 in this case, and `mod` is set to 1000000007, which is used to handle integer overflow.
The function then sets the first two elements of the `dp` array to `k` and `k*k`, respectively.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from the third element to the `n`th element of the `dp` array. For each element `i`, it calculates the number of ways to choose `k` elements from the first `i` elements using the formula `(k - 1) * (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])`. This formula is used to avoid counting the same set of elements multiple times. The result is then moduloed by `mod` to handle integer overflow.
Finally, the function returns the value of the `dp` array at index `n`, which is the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `count_no_of_ways(2, 4)` is 11.
