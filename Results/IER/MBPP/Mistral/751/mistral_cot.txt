 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_min_heap_helper` takes two arguments: `arr` and `i`. `arr` is the input array and `i` is the current node being checked. The function returns `True` if the current node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no left or right children) or if it is a leaf node and its left child is also a leaf node.
The function first checks if the current node has a left child by checking if `2 * i + 2` is less than the length of the array. If it is, it checks if the left child is a leaf node by calling `check_min_heap_helper` with the current node's index as the argument.
The function then checks if the current node has a right child by checking if `2 * i + 2` is equal to the length of the array. If it is, it checks if the right child is a leaf node by checking if the current node's value is less than or equal to the value of the right child.
The function returns `True` if both the left and right children are leaf nodes, otherwise it returns `False`.
The function `check_min_heap` takes an array as input and returns `True` if the array is a min-heap, otherwise it returns `False`. It does this by calling `check_min_heap_helper` with the root node of the array as the argument.
