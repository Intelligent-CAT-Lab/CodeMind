 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `bitwise_xor` takes two tuples as input, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over the corresponding elements of the two tuples.
For each pair of elements, it applies the bitwise XOR operation using the `^` operator. The result is a tuple of the same length as the input tuples, where each element is the result of the bitwise XOR operation applied to the corresponding elements of the input tuples.
The function returns this tuple.
