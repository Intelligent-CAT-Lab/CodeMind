 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_occurences` takes a list of tuples as input. It first converts each tuple to a tuple of its elements using the `map()` function and the `sorted()` function. This is done to sort the elements of each tuple in ascending order.
Then, it applies the `Counter()` function from the `collections` module to each tuple of sorted elements. This function returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements and the values are the number of times each element appears in the input list.
Finally, it returns the resulting dictionary.

  (1, 3): 2,
  (2, 5): 1,
  (3, 1): 1,
  (5, 2): 1,
