 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `adjac` takes two arguments: `ele` and `sub`. `ele` is a tuple of two integers, and `sub` is a list of integers.
The function uses a recursive approach to generate all possible adjacent tuples of `ele` by iterating over all possible values of the first element of the tuple, and for each value, it generates all possible values of the second element of the tuple by recursively calling the `adjac` function with the remaining elements of the tuple and the current value of the second element added to the `sub` list.
The function then yields all the generated adjacent tuples.
The function `get_coordinates` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input and returns a list of all the adjacent tuples generated by the `adjac` function.
