 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `subject_marks` takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains the name of a subject and its corresponding marks.
The function first sorts the list of tuples in ascending order based on the second element of each tuple (i.e., the marks).
The sorted list of tuples is then returned as the output.
