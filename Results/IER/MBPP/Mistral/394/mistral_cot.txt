 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_distinct` takes a tuple as input and returns a boolean value.
The variable `res` is initialized to `True` and will be used to keep track of whether the tuple contains any duplicate elements.
The variable `temp` is initialized as an empty set and will be used to store the unique elements of the tuple.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element of the tuple.
For each element, it checks if it is already in the set `temp`. If it is, it sets `res` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
If the element is not in the set, it adds it to the set and continues to the next element.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of `res`.
<<<Output>>>
False
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
The input tuple `(1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)` contains two duplicate elements (1 and 4), so the function returns `False`.
