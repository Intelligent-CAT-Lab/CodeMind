 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_total_number_of_sequences` takes two arguments, `m` and `n`, which represent the dimensions of a matrix. The matrix is initialized as a 2D list `T` with `m+1` rows and `n+1` columns, where each element is initialized to 0.
The function then enters two nested loops that iterate over each element of the matrix `T`. For each element, it checks if the element is in the first row or first column, in which case it is initialized to 0. If the element is in the first row, it is initialized to the value of the row index. If the element is in any other position, it is initialized to the sum of the element in the previous row and the element in the previous row and column, divided by 2.
After the loops finish, the function returns the value of the element in the last row and last column of the matrix `T`, which is the total number of sequences.
For the input `get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4)`, the matrix `T` will have the following values:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
The total number of sequences is the value of the element in the last row and last column of this matrix, which is 144.
<<<Output>>>
144
