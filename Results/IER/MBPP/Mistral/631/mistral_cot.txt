 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `replace_spaces` takes a string as input and returns a new string with all spaces replaced by underscores.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is a space or an underscore.
If it is a space, it returns an underscore.
If it is an underscore, it returns the character itself.
Finally, the function uses the `join` method to concatenate all the characters in the list into a single string.
