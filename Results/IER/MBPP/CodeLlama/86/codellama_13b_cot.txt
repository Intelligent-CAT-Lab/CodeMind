  The output of the code is:

A) Hello, Alice!

The function greet() takes a string argument "name" and returns a string "Hello, " + name + "!". The print() function is then called with the argument "Alice", which is passed to the greet() function and returns the string "Hello, Alice!". Therefore, the output of the code is "Hello, Alice!".

Therefore, the correct answer is option A) Hello, Alice!
