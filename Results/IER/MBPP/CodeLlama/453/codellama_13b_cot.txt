The function sumofFactors takes an integer n as input.
The function first checks if n is odd by checking if n % 2 != 0. If it is, it returns 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider factors from 2 to 9.
For each factor i in this range, it calculates the number of times i divides n and stores it in count.
The code then calculates the sum of the terms of the geometric series 1 + i + i^2 + ... + i^count.
The code then multiplies the result by the result of the previous iteration and stores it in res.
The code then checks if n is greater than or equal to 2 and adds 1 + n to res if it is.
The function finally returns res.

In this case, n is 18, so the function will consider factors from 2 to 9.
The function will calculate the sum of the terms of the geometric series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 for factor 2.
The function will calculate the sum of the terms of the geometric series 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 34 for factor 3.
The function will calculate the sum of the terms of the geometric series 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 = 81 for factor 4.
The function will calculate the sum of the terms of the geometric series 1 + 5 + 25 + 125 = 155 for factor 5.
The function will calculate the sum of the terms of the geometric series 1 + 6 + 36 + 216 = 281 for factor 6.
The function will calculate the sum of the terms of the geometric series 1 + 7 + 49 + 343 = 421 for factor 7.
The function will calculate the sum of the terms of the geometric series 1 + 8 + 64 + 512 = 593 for factor 8.
The function will calculate the sum of the terms of the geometric series 1 + 9 + 81 + 729 = 821 for factor 9.
The function will then add 1 + 18 = 19 to res.
The final value of res will be 821 + 19 = 840.

<<<Output>>>
840
