The function opposite_Signs takes two integers x and y as input.
The function returns true if the signs of x and y are opposite, and false otherwise.
The function uses the bitwise XOR operator (^) to check if the signs of x and y are opposite.
The bitwise XOR operator returns 1 if the signs of x and y are opposite, and 0 otherwise.
The function then checks if the result of the bitwise XOR operation is less than 0.
If the result is less than 0, the function returns true, indicating that the signs of x and y are opposite.
If the result is greater than or equal to 0, the function returns false, indicating that the signs of x and y are not opposite.
<<<Output>>>
True
