The function cube_nums takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of their cubes.
The code first defines a lambda function that takes a single number x and returns x cubed.
The code then applies this lambda function to each number in the input list using the map function.
The resulting list of cubes is then returned.

In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
The lambda function will be applied to each number in the list, resulting in the following list of cubes:
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]

Therefore, the return value of the function is [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]
