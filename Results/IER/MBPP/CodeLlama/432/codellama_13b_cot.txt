<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called median_trapezium that takes three arguments: base1, base2, and height.
The function calculates the median of the trapezium with the given base1, base2, and height.
The median is calculated by taking the average of the two bases and multiplying it by 0.5.
The function then returns the median.

In this case, the input values are base1 = 15, base2 = 25, and height = 35.
The median of the trapezium is calculated as follows:
median = 0.5 * (15 + 25) = 0.5 * 40 = 20

Therefore, the return value of the code is 20.
<<<Output>>>
20
