<<<Analysis>>>
The function eulerian_num takes two arguments, n and m.
The function first checks if m is greater than or equal to n or if n is equal to 0. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns 0.
The function then checks if m is equal to 0. If it is, the function returns 1.
If none of the above conditions are true, the function calculates the return value using the following formula:
((n - m) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1) + (m + 1) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m))
The function then returns the calculated value.

Based on the analysis, the return value of eulerian_num(3, 1) would be:
((3 - 1) * eulerian_num(2, 0) + (1 + 1) * eulerian_num(2, 1))
= ((2) * 1 + (2) * 1)
= 4
