<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to "hello" and ch is initialized to "l".
The code enters the first loop, which iterates from 0 to the length of s (4).
For each iteration, it checks if the character at the current index is equal to ch.
If it is, it removes the character at the current index and the character after it by slicing the string.
The loop breaks when the first occurrence of ch is found.
The code then enters the second loop, which iterates from the length of s - 1 to 0 (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if the character at the current index is equal to ch.
If it is, it removes the character at the current index and the character before it by slicing the string.
The loop breaks when the first occurrence of ch is found.
The code then returns the final value of s, which is "helo".
<<<Output>>>
helo
