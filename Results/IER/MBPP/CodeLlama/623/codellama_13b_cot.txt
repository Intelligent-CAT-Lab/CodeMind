<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: nums, which is a list of numbers, and n, which is an integer.
The function first creates a new list called nth_nums by applying the map function to the list nums.
The map function applies the lambda function to each element of nums, which raises each element to the power of n.
The lambda function takes a single argument x, which is an element of nums, and returns x ** n.
The function then returns the list nth_nums.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
