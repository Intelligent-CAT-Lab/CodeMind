<<<Analysis>>>
The function change_date_format takes a string argument dt, which is a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
The function uses the re module to perform a regular expression substitution on the input string.
The regular expression pattern is r'(\d{4})-(\d{1,2})-(\d{1,2})', which matches a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
The replacement string is '\\3-\\2-\\1', which is the same as the input string but with the day and month values swapped.
The function returns the modified string.
