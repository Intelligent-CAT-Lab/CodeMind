<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes three lists as input: l1, l2, and l3.
The function iterates through the three lists simultaneously using the zip() function.
For each iteration, the function checks if the corresponding elements in the three lists are equal.
If they are, the function appends the element to the result list.
The function returns the result list.

In this case, the input lists are:
l1 = [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
l2 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
l3 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]

The function iterates through the lists and checks if the corresponding elements are equal.
The first two elements in the lists are equal, so the function appends 1 to the result list.
The next two elements are not equal, so the function does not append anything.
The next two elements are equal, so the function appends 3 to the result list.
The next two elements are not equal, so the function does not append anything.
The next two elements are equal, so the function appends 5 to the result list.
The next two elements are not equal, so the function does not append anything.
The next two elements are equal, so the function appends 7 to the result list.

The final result list is [1, 3, 5, 7].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 5, 7]
