<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_Monotonic takes an array A as input.
The function returns True if all elements in A are either increasing or decreasing, and False otherwise.
The function uses the all() function to check if all elements in A are either increasing or decreasing.
The all() function takes a generator expression as input, which is a sequence of elements that are either increasing or decreasing.
The generator expression is created using the range() function, which generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to len(A) - 1.
The range() function is used to iterate over the elements in A, and the comparison operator is used to check if each element is either increasing or decreasing.
The comparison operator is either <= or >=, depending on whether the function is checking for increasing or decreasing elements.
The all() function returns True if all elements in the generator expression are True, and False otherwise.
The function returns the result of the all() function, which is True if all elements in A are either increasing or decreasing, and False otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
True
