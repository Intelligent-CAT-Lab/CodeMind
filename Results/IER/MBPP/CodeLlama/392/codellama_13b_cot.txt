<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 60.
The code initializes an empty list res and appends 0 and 1 to it.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 60.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the maximum sum of the previous numbers in the list that are divisible by i.
The code appends the maximum sum to the list res.
The loop finishes when i reaches n + 1.
The code returns the final value of res[n], which is the maximum sum of the previous numbers in the list that are divisible by n.
<<<Output>>>
