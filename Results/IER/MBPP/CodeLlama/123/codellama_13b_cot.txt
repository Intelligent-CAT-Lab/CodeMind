  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable limit is initialized to 999.
The code checks if the input is an integer and if it is bigger than 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to limit+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 1000.
For each number num in this range, it calculates the sum of its factors and stores it in sum_fact.
The code then calculates the sum of the factors of sum_fact and stores it in sum_fact2.
The code checks if num is equal to sum_fact2 and if num is not equal to sum_fact. If both conditions are met, it adds num and sum_fact2 to a set called amicables.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the sum of the elements in the amicables set.
