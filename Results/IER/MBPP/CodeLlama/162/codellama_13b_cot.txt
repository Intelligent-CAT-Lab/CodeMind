<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a recursive function called sum_series that takes an integer n as input.
The function first checks if n is less than 1, and if it is, it returns 0.
If n is greater than or equal to 1, the function returns n + sum_series(n - 2).
The function calls itself with the argument n - 2, which is the same as the previous function call, but with a smaller value of n.
The function continues to call itself with smaller values of n until it reaches the base case, which is when n is less than 1.
At this point, the function returns 0, and the previous function call returns the sum of the current value of n and the previous function call.
This process continues until the function reaches the original input value of n, at which point the function returns the final sum.
