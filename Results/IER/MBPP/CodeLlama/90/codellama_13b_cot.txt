<<<Analysis>>>
The function len_log takes a list of strings as input.
The function first initializes the variable max to the length of the first element of the list.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the list.
For each element i, the function checks if the length of i is greater than the current value of max.
If it is, the function updates the value of max to the length of i.
The function then returns the final value of max.

In this case, the input list is ["python","PHP","bigdata"].
The length of the first element of the list is 6.
The length of the second element of the list is 3.
The length of the third element of the list is 6.
The function updates the value of max to 6, since it is the largest length among the elements of the list.
The function then returns the final value of max, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
