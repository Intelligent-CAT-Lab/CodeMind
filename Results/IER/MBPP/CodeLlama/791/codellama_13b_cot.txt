<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a tuple as input and returns a tuple.
The function iterates over the input tuple using the enumerate function, which returns a tuple of the index and the element at that index.
The function checks if the element is not a tuple using the isinstance function. If it is not a tuple, it adds the element to the result tuple.
The function returns the result tuple.

In this case, the input tuple is (1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10).
The function iterates over the input tuple and adds the elements that are not tuples to the result tuple.
The result tuple is (1, 5, 7, 10).

<<<Output>>>
(1, 5, 7, 10)
