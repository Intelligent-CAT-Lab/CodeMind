<<<Analysis>>>
The function pair_xor_Sum takes two arguments: an array arr and an integer n.
The function first initializes a variable ans to 0.
The function then enters a nested loop that iterates over the array arr.
The outer loop iterates from 0 to n-1, and the inner loop iterates from i+1 to n-1.
For each pair of elements in the array, the function calculates the XOR of the two elements and adds it to ans.
The function then returns the final value of ans.

In this case, the input array is [5,9,7,6], and the input integer n is 4.
The function will iterate over the array and calculate the XOR of each pair of elements.
The XOR of 5 and 9 is 14, the XOR of 5 and 7 is 12, the XOR of 5 and 6 is 11, the XOR of 9 and 7 is 14, and the XOR of 9 and 6 is 15.
The function will then return the sum of all these XOR values, which is 11+12+14+15 = 55.
<<<Output>>>
55
