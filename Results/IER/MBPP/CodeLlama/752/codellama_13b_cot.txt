<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code initializes an array dp with 6 elements, with the first two elements initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i] using the formula dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 2 * dp[i - 2].
The loop finishes and the code returns the final value of dp[n], which is 13.
<<<Output>>>
13
