  <<<Analysis>>>
The function remove_dirty_chars takes two strings as input, the first string is the string to be cleaned, and the second string is the string containing the characters to be removed.
The function first converts the first string to a list of characters using the str_to_list function.
The function then converts the second string to a list of characters using the str_to_list function.
The function then creates a count array of size 256 using the get_char_count_array function.
The function then iterates over the list of characters in the second string and increments the corresponding index in the count array.
The function then iterates over the list of characters in the first string and checks if the corresponding index in the count array is 0. If it is, it appends the character to a temporary list.
The function then converts the temporary list back to a string using the lst_to_string function and returns it.
