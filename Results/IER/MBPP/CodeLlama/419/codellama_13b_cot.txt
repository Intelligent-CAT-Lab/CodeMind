<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of floating-point numbers as input.
The length of the list is calculated and stored in the variable length.
The function then maps the round function to each element of the list, which rounds each element to the nearest integer.
The resulting list is then multiplied by the length of the original list, which effectively duplicates each element.
The sum of the resulting list is then calculated and returned.

The input list is [22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50].
The rounded list is [22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17].
The duplicated list is [22, 22, 4, 4, -16, -16, -9, -9, 11, 11, -12, -12, 14, 14, -5, -5, 17, 17].
The sum of the duplicated list is 124.

<<<Output>>>
