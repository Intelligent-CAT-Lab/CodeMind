<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments, arr and x.
The length of the array is calculated and stored in n.
The low and high variables are initialized to 0 and n-1, respectively.
The res variable is initialized to -1.
The while loop starts with low <= high.
The mid variable is calculated as (low + high) // 2.
The if statement checks if arr[mid] is greater than x. If it is, the high variable is set to mid - 1.
If arr[mid] is less than x, the low variable is set to mid + 1.
If arr[mid] is equal to x, the res variable is set to mid and the low variable is set to mid + 1.
The while loop continues until low is greater than high.
The function returns the value of res.
