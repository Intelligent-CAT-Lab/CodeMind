<<<Analysis>>>
The function freq_count takes a list as input and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each element in the list.
The function first imports the collections module, which provides a Counter class that can be used to count the frequency of elements in a list.
The function then defines a variable freq_count and assigns it the value of collections.Counter(list1), which creates a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the list.
The function then returns the value of freq_count, which is a dictionary with the frequency of each element in the list.
<<<Output>>>
{10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1}
