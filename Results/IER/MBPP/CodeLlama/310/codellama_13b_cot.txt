<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and returns a tuple of all the non-whitespace characters in the string.
The variable str1 is initialized to "python 3.0".
The code then creates a generator expression that iterates over the characters in str1 and yields each character that is not a whitespace character.
The generator expression is then converted to a tuple using the tuple() function.
The code then returns the resulting tuple.
<<<Output>>>
('p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n')
