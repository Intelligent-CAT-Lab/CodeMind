The variable test_tuple is initialized to (4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8).
The variable even_fnc is initialized to a lambda function that takes an argument x and returns True if x is even and False otherwise.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of test_tuple.
For each element ele in test_tuple, it checks if ele is a tuple. If it is, it recursively calls the function even_ele on ele and the same even_fnc function.
If ele is not a tuple, it checks if the even_fnc function returns True when called on ele. If it does, it adds ele to the tuple res.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of res, which is (4, 6, 8).
<<<Output>>>
(4, 6, 8)
