<<<Analysis>>>
The function count_no_of_ways takes two arguments, n and k.
The function initializes a list dp with n+1 elements, each initialized to 0.
The function sets total to k and mod to 1000000007.
The function sets dp[1] to k and dp[2] to k*k.
The function enters a loop that iterates from 3 to n+1.
For each iteration, the function calculates dp[i] as ((k-1)*(dp[i-1]+dp[i-2]))%mod.
The function returns dp[n].
