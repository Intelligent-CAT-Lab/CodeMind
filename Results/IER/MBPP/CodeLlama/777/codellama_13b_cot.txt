<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes an array as input and sorts it.
The function then initializes a variable sum to the first element of the array.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of the array (exclusive), meaning it will consider all elements except the last one.
For each element i in this range, the function checks if the current element is not equal to the next element. If it is, it adds the next element to the sum.
The function then returns the final value of sum.
