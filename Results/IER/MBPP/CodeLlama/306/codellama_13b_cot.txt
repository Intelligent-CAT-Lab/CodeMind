  <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes four arguments:

* a: an array of integers
* n: the length of the array
* index: an integer representing the index of the array to start the calculation from
* k: an integer representing the index of the array to end the calculation at

The function first initializes a 2D array dp with the same dimensions as the input array.
It then iterates through the array and calculates the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence for each index.
The calculation is done by comparing the current element with the previous element and the previous maximum sum.
If the current element is greater than the previous element and the previous maximum sum, the current element is added to the previous maximum sum.
Otherwise, the previous maximum sum is used.
The function then returns the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence for the specified indices.
