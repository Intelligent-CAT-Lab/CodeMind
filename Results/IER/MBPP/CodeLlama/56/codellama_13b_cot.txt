The function check takes an integer n as input.
The function rev takes an integer num as input.
The function rev calculates the reverse of the input number num.
The function check checks if the reverse of the input number num is equal to the input number num plus 1.
The function check returns True if the condition is met, and False otherwise.

The function rev works as follows:
1. Initialize the variable rev_num to 0.
2. While the input number num is greater than 0, perform the following steps:
a. Calculate the remainder of num divided by 10, and store it in num % 10.
b. Multiply rev_num by 10 and add num % 10 to it.
c. Divide num by 10 and store the result in num // 10.
3. Return the final value of rev_num.

The function check works as follows:
1. Calculate the reverse of the input number num using the function rev.
2. Check if the reverse of the input number num is equal to the input number num plus 1.
3. Return True if the condition is met, and False otherwise.

In this case, the input number n is 70.
The function rev calculates the reverse of 70, which is 7.
The function check checks if 7 is equal to 70 + 1, which is False.
Therefore, the function check returns False.
