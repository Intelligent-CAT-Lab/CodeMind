  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes an empty string variable vowels to store the vowels in the input string str1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in str1.
For each character, it checks if it is a vowel (i.e., if it is in the set "aeiouAEIOU").
If it is a vowel, it appends the character to the end of the vowels string.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes an empty string variable result_string to store the reversed vowels.
The code then enters another loop that iterates through each character in str1.
For each character, it checks if it is a vowel.
If it is a vowel, it appends the last vowel in the vowels string to the end of result_string, and then removes the last vowel from the vowels string.
If it is not a vowel, it appends the character to the end of result_string.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of result_string, which is "yhtonP".
<<<Output>>>
