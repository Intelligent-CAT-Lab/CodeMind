<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a tuple as input, which is (1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4) in this case.
The function first initializes a variable res to True, which will be used to store the result of the check.
It then initializes an empty set temp.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the input tuple.
For each element ele in the tuple, it checks if ele is already in temp. If it is, it sets res to False and breaks out of the loop.
If ele is not in temp, it adds it to temp.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of res, which is False in this case.
<<<Output>>>
False
