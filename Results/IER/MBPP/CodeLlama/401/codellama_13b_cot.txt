  <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two tuples as input, test_tup1 and test_tup2.
The function first zips the two tuples together to create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the corresponding elements from the two input tuples.
The function then applies a list comprehension to each tuple in the list, where it zips the two tuples together and adds their corresponding elements.
The function then converts the resulting list of tuples to a tuple of tuples using the tuple() function.
The function then returns the resulting tuple of tuples.
