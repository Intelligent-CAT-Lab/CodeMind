<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of tuples as input.
The function creates an empty dictionary out.
The function then iterates over the input list and for each tuple, it tries to extend the list of values associated with the first element of the tuple (elem[0]) in the dictionary out.
If the first element of the tuple is not already a key in the dictionary, it adds the tuple as a new key-value pair in the dictionary.
The function then returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains the values associated with each key in the dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
[('y', 'z'), ('t')]
