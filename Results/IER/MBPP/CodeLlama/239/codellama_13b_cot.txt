The function get_total_number_of_sequences takes two arguments, m and n, which are integers.
The function initializes a 2D array T with dimensions m+1 x n+1, where each element is initialized to 0.
The function then enters a nested loop that iterates over the indices i and j of the array T.
The loop checks if i or j is 0, and if so, sets the corresponding element of T to 0.
The loop also checks if i is less than j, and if so, sets the corresponding element of T to 0.
If j is equal to 1, the loop sets the corresponding element of T to i.
Otherwise, the loop sets the corresponding element of T to the sum of the elements of T at indices i-1 and j-1.
The function then returns the element of T at indices m and n.

Based on the analysis, the return value of get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) would be 10.
<<<Output>>>
