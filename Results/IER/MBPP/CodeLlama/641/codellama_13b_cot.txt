  The output of the code is:

A) Hello, Alice!

Explanation:
The function greet takes a string as input and returns a string. The function body concatenates the string "Hello, " with the input string and adds an exclamation mark at the end. The print function is then called with the output of the greet function as its argument, which is "Hello, Alice!". Therefore, the output of the code is "Hello, Alice!".

Therefore, the correct answer is option A) Hello, Alice!
