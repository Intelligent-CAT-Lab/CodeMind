  <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two tuples as input, test_tup1 and test_tup2.
The function first zips the two tuples together to create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the corresponding elements from the two input tuples.
The function then applies the max function to each element in each tuple to get the maximum value.
The function then zips the resulting list of tuples together to create a tuple of tuples.
The function then returns the resulting tuple of tuples.

<<<Output>>>
((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))
