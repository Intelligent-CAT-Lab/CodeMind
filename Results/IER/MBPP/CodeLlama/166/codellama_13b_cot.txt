The function takes an array A as input.
The function first initializes a variable count to 0.
The function then enters a nested loop that iterates over the array A.
The outer loop iterates over the indices of the array A, starting from 0.
The inner loop iterates over the indices of the array A, starting from the current index of the outer loop.
The code checks if the XOR of the two elements at the current indices is even.
If it is, the code increments the variable count by 1.
The code then returns the final value of count.

The input array A is [5, 4, 7, 2, 1].
The outer loop iterates over the indices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
The inner loop iterates over the indices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
The XOR of the two elements at the indices 0 and 1 is 5 XOR 4 = 1, which is odd.
The XOR of the two elements at the indices 1 and 2 is 4 XOR 7 = 3, which is odd.
The XOR of the two elements at the indices 2 and 3 is 7 XOR 2 = 5, which is odd.
The XOR of the two elements at the indices 3 and 4 is 2 XOR 1 = 3, which is odd.
The XOR of the two elements at the indices 4 and 5 is 1 XOR 5 = 4, which is even.
Therefore, the function returns 1.
