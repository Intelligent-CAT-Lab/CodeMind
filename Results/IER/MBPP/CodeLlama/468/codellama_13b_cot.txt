The variable arr is initialized to [3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6].
The variable n is initialized to 6, which is the length of the array.
The variable mpis is initialized to a copy of arr.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider each element of the array.
For each element i in this range, it calculates the product of the elements from i to n-1 (inclusive) and stores it in current_prod.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from i+1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider each element j from i+1 to n-1 (inclusive).
For each element j in this range, the code checks if arr[j-1] is greater than arr[j]. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If arr[j-1] is not greater than arr[j], the code multiplies current_prod by arr[j] and stores the result in current_prod.
If current_prod is greater than mpis[j], the code updates mpis[j] with the value of current_prod.
The code then increments j by 1 and repeats the loop.
After the nested loop finishes, the code updates mpis[i] with the value of current_prod.
The code then repeats the loop for each element i in the range 0 to n-1 (inclusive).
After the loop finishes, the code returns the maximum value of mpis.
