The variable l is initialized to 3, which is the input to the function.
The code then calculates the volume of a cube with side length l, which is 3 in this case.
The volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying the side length by itself three times, which is 3 * 3 * 3 = 27.
The code then returns the volume, which is 27.
<<<Output>>>
27
