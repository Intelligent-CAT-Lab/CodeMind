The variable arr is initialized to [1,2,1], and variable n is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider pairs of elements from the array.
For each pair of elements i and j, it checks if they are not equal. If they are not equal, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
The condition is met when i is 0 and j is 1, when i is 0 and j is 2, and when i is 1 and j is 2.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of cnt, which is 3.
