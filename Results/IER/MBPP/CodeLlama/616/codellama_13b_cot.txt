<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two tuples as input, test_tup1 and test_tup2.
The function uses the zip() function to iterate over the two tuples simultaneously.
The function uses the modulo operator (%) to calculate the remainder of each element in test_tup1 divided by the corresponding element in test_tup2.
The function then uses the tuple() function to convert the resulting list into a tuple.
The function returns the resulting tuple.

<<<Output>>>
(1, 4, 5, 6)
