<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function greet that takes a string name as input and returns a string "Hello, " + name + "!".
The function is then called with the argument "Alice", which is a string.
The function concatenates the string "Hello, " with the input string "Alice" and the string "!", resulting in the string "Hello, Alice!".
The function returns this string, which is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
Hello, Alice!
