<<<Analysis>>>
The function text_match_three takes a string argument text and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string matches the regular expression pattern 'ab{3}?'.
The regular expression pattern 'ab{3}?' matches any string that contains the substring 'ab' followed by any character (the '?' makes the 'b' optional).
The function re.search is used to search for the pattern in the input string text.
The return value of the function is the result of the search, which is either None (if no match is found) or a Match object (if a match is found).

In this case, the input string "ac" does not match the pattern 'ab{3}?', so the function returns None.
<<<Output>>>
None
