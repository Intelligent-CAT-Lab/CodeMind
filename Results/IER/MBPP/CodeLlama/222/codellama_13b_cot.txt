The function check_type takes a tuple as input.
The function first initializes a variable res to True.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the input tuple.
For each element ele in the tuple, the function checks if the element is of the same type as the first element of the tuple using the isinstance() function.
If the element is not of the same type, the function sets res to False and breaks out of the loop.
The function then returns the value of res.
