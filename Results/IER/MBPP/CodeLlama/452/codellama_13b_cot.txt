<<<Analysis>>>
The function loss_amount takes two arguments, actual_cost and sale_amount.
The function first checks if sale_amount is greater than actual_cost.
If it is, it calculates the loss amount by subtracting actual_cost from sale_amount and returns the result.
If it is not, it returns 0.

In this case, sale_amount is 1200 and actual_cost is 1500.
The condition is not met, so the function returns 0.
<<<Output>>>
