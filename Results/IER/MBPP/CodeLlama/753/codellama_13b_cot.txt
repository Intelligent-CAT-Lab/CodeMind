<<<Analysis>>>
The function min_k takes two arguments: a list of tuples (test_list) and an integer K.
The function first sorts the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple (i.e., the integer value) using the sorted() function.
The key argument of the sorted() function is a lambda function that takes each tuple as an argument and returns the second element of the tuple.
The sorted() function then returns a new list containing the first K elements of the sorted list.
The function then returns the new list.

In this case, the input list is [('Manjeet', 10), ('Akshat', 4), ('Akash', 2), ('Nikhil', 8)], and K is 2.
The sorted list is [('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4), ('Manjeet', 10), ('Nikhil', 8)].
The first two elements of the sorted list are [('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4)], which are the smallest two elements in the list based on the second element of each tuple.
The function returns [('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4)].
<<<Output>>>
[('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4)]
