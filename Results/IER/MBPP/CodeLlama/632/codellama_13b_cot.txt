<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of numbers as input, num_list.
The function first creates a new list a with the same number of elements as the number of zeros in num_list. Each element in a is initialized to 0.
The function then creates a new list x by iterating through num_list and selecting only the non-zero elements.
The function then returns the concatenation of x and a.

In this case, num_list is [1,0,2,0,3,4].
The number of zeros in num_list is 2.
a is initialized to [0,0].
x is initialized to [1,2,3,4].
The function returns x + a, which is [1,2,3,4,0,0].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0]
