<<<Analysis>>>
The variable M is initialized to the list of lists [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]].
The code then calls the sorted function on M, with the key parameter set to the sum function.
The sorted function sorts the elements of M based on the value returned by the sum function.
The sum function returns the sum of the elements in a list.
In this case, the sum function is called on each sublist of M, and the resulting sums are used to sort the sublists.
The sorted function returns a new list with the sublists sorted in ascending order based on their sum.
The code then returns the result of the sorted function.
<<<Output>>>
[[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]
