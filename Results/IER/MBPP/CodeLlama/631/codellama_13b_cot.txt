<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and returns a string.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is a space or an underscore.
If it is a space, it replaces it with an underscore.
If it is an underscore, it replaces it with a space.
Otherwise, it leaves the character unchanged.
The list comprehension is then converted to a string using the "".join() method.
