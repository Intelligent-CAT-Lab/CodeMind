<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and returns a modified string.
The code iterates through each character in the input string using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if it is a digit using the isdigit() method.
If it is a digit, it appends it to a variable called dig.
If it is not a digit, it appends it to a variable called res.
After the loop finishes, the code appends the value of dig to res.
The code then returns the value of res.
