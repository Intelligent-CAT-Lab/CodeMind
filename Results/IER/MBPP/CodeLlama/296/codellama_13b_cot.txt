The variable arr is initialized to [1,20,6,4,5].
The variable inv_count is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of inversions in the array.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the array, starting from the first element.
For each element i in the array, the code enters another loop that iterates through the remaining elements of the array, starting from the element after i.
For each element j in this inner loop, the code checks if i is greater than j. If it is, it increments the variable inv_count by 1.
The code repeats this process for each element i in the array, and then returns the final value of inv_count.
