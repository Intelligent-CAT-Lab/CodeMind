<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_samepatterns takes two arguments: colors and patterns.
The function first checks if the length of colors and patterns are equal. If they are not, it returns False.
The function then initializes three sets: pset, sset, and sdict.
The function then iterates through the patterns and colors using a for loop.
For each pattern and color, it adds the pattern to pset and the color to sset.
If the pattern is not in sdict.keys(), it adds the pattern to sdict with an empty list as its value.
It then adds the color to the list of values associated with the pattern in sdict.
The function then checks if the length of pset and sset are equal. If they are not, it returns False.
The function then iterates through the values in sdict and checks if each value is equal to the previous value. If it is not, it returns False.
If all the values are equal, the function returns True.
