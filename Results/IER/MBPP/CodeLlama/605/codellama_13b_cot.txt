<<<Analysis>>>
The function prime_num takes an integer argument num.
The function first checks if num is greater than or equal to 1. If it is, it enters a loop that iterates from 2 to num//2.
For each number i in this range, it checks if num is divisible by i. If it is, it returns False.
If num is not divisible by any number in this range, it returns True.
The function also has an else clause that returns False if num is less than 1.
