<<<Analysis>>>
The function index_minimum takes a list of tuples as input.
The function uses the operator module's itemgetter function to extract the second element of each tuple in the list.
The function then uses the min function to find the minimum value of the second elements.
The function then uses the index method to find the index of the minimum value in the original list.
The function returns the index of the minimum value.

In this case, the list of tuples is [('Rash', 143), ('Manjeet', 200), ('Varsha', 100)].
The second element of each tuple is 143, 200, and 100, respectively.
The minimum value of the second elements is 100, which is the second element of the tuple ('Varsha', 100).
The index of the minimum value in the original list is 2.

Therefore, the return value of the function is 2.
