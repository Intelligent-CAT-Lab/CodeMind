<<<Analysis>>>
The function square_nums takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of their squares.
The code first creates a list comprehension using the map function, which applies the lambda function to each element of the input list.
The lambda function takes a single argument x and returns x squared.
The map function applies this function to each element of the input list and returns a new list with the results.
The code then returns this new list.

The input list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
The output list is [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
