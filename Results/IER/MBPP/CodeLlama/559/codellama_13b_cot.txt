  <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: an array a and an integer size.
The function first initializes two variables: max_so_far and max_ending_here.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to size (exclusive).
For each iteration, the function adds the current element of the array to max_ending_here.
The function then checks if max_ending_here is less than 0. If it is, it sets max_ending_here to 0.
If max_ending_here is greater than or equal to 0, the function checks if max_so_far is less than max_ending_here. If it is, it sets max_so_far to max_ending_here.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of max_so_far.
