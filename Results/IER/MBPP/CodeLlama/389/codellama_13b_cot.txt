The function find_lucas takes an integer n as input and returns the nth number in the Lucas sequence.
The Lucas sequence is defined as follows:
L(0) = 2
L(1) = 1
L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

The function find_lucas works by recursively calling itself with the input n-1 and n-2 until it reaches the base case where n is 0 or 1.

In this case, the input is 9, so the function will recursively call itself with the inputs 8 and 7.

The function will then return the sum of the results of the recursive calls, which is 1 + 3 = 4.
