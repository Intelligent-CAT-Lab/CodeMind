The function takes an integer n as input.
The function returns the binary representation of n, which is calculated using the bin() function.
The bin() function returns a string in the format "0b1010", where the first two characters "0b" are the prefix and the remaining characters are the binary representation of the input.
The replace() method is used to remove the prefix "0b" from the string.
The function returns the binary representation of n without the prefix.
