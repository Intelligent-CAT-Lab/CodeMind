<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of strings as input, and the code inside the function filters the list to only include strings that start with an uppercase letter and have at least one lowercase letter.
The filtered list is then joined into a single string using the ''.join() method, and the length of this string is returned.

In this case, the filtered list will contain the strings 'Dylan', 'Diana', and 'Joanne', and the length of the joined string will be 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
