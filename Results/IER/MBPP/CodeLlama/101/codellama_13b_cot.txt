<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: an array arr and an integer k.
The function first calculates the length of the array using the len() function and stores it in the variable n.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the loop enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-i-1 (inclusive).
The inner loop checks if the element at index j is greater than the element at index j+1. If it is, the function swaps the two elements.
The function then returns the element at index k-1, which is the second element in the array.
