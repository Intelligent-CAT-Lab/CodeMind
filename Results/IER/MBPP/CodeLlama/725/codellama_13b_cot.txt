The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression functions.
The function extract_quotation takes a string argument text1 and returns a list of strings that match the regular expression r'"(.*?)"'.
The regular expression matches any string that starts and ends with a double quote, and captures the text between the quotes.
The function uses the re.findall function to find all occurrences of the regular expression in the input string text1.
The return value of the function is a list of strings that match the regular expression.

['A53', 'multi', 'Processor']
