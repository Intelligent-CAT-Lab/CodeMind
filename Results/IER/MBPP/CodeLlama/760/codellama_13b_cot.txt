The function takes an array as input and returns True if all elements in the array are the same, and False otherwise.
The function first converts the array to a set using the set() function. A set is a collection of unique elements, so if all elements in the array are the same, the set will contain only one element.
The function then checks if the length of the set is equal to 1, which means that all elements in the array are the same. If this condition is met, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
