<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a tuple as input, which is assigned to the variable test_tup.
The function then creates a new tuple called res, which is created by multiplying each element of test_tup with the corresponding element of test_tup[1:].
The function then returns the tuple res.

In this case, the input tuple is (1, 5, 7, 8, 10).
The function will multiply each element of the input tuple with the corresponding element of the slice of the input tuple starting from the second element.
The resulting tuple will be (5, 35, 56, 80, 100).

Therefore, the return value of the function will be (5, 35, 56, 80, 100).
<<<Output>>>
(5, 35, 56, 80, 100)
