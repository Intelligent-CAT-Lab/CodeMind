<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two tuples as input, test_tup1 and test_tup2.
The function first converts the tuples to sets using the set() function.
The ^ operator is used to find the symmetric difference between the two sets.
The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either set but not in both.
The resulting set is then converted back to a tuple using the tuple() function.
The function then returns the resulting tuple.

In this case, the symmetric difference between the two sets is (3, 6, 7, 10).
<<<Output>>>
(3, 6, 7, 10)
