The variable list1 is initialized to [[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 11], [1, 15, 7]].
The variable x is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the length of list1, which is 4.
For each iteration, the code checks if x is in the current element of list1.
The first element of list1 is [1, 3], which contains 1. Therefore, the counter ctr is incremented by 1.
The second element of list1 is [5, 7], which does not contain 1. Therefore, the counter ctr remains the same.
The third element of list1 is [1, 11], which contains 1. Therefore, the counter ctr is incremented by 1.
The fourth element of list1 is [1, 15, 7], which contains 1. Therefore, the counter ctr is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ctr, which is 3.
