<<<Analysis>>>
The variables r and h are initialized to 5 and 12, respectively.
The code calculates the length of the lateral surface of the cone using the formula:
LSA = πrL
where L is the length of the lateral surface.
The code calculates L by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of r and h.
L = √(r^2 + h^2)
In this case, L = √(5^2 + 12^2) = √(25 + 144) = √169
The code then multiplies π by r and L to get the final value of LSA.
LSA = πrL = π(5)(169) = 845.398
<<<Output>>>
845.398
