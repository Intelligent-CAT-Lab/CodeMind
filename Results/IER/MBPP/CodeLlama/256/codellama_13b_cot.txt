The variable n is initialized to 5, which means the code will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number num in this range, it checks if num is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it skips to the next iteration of the loop.
For each number num in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 2 to num (exclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if num is divisible by i. If it is, it breaks out of the inner loop and continues to the next iteration of the outer loop.
If the inner loop completes without breaking, it means that num is a prime number. The code then increments the variable ctr by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ctr, which is 2.
