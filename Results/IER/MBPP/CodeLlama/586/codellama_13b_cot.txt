<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments, l and n.
l is a list of integers, and n is an integer.
The function returns a new list that is a combination of the elements of l from the nth element to the end, and the elements of l from the beginning to the nth element.
In this case, l is [12,10,5,6,52,36], and n is 2.
The function returns [5,6,52,36,12,10].
<<<Output>>>
[5,6,52,36,12,10]
