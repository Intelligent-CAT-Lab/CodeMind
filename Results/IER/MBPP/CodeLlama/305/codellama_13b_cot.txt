<<<Analysis>>>
The function start_withp takes a list of strings as input.
The function uses the re module to match the input strings with a regular expression pattern.
The regular expression pattern is "(P\w+)\W(P\w+)", which matches any string that starts with "P" followed by one or more word characters, followed by a non-word character, followed by "P" followed by one or more word characters.
The function then iterates over the input list of strings and checks if each string matches the regular expression pattern.
If a string matches the pattern, the function returns the two groups of the match, which are the two strings that start with "P" and are separated by a non-word character.
If no string matches the pattern, the function returns None.
<<<Output>>>
None
