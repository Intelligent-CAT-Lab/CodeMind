<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a list of numbers that appear only once in the input list.
The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list, and checks if each number appears only once in the list using the count() method.
The list comprehension returns a new list containing only the numbers that appear once in the input list.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 5]
