<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10, which means the code will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
The code then initializes an empty list ludics and appends the numbers from 1 to 10 to it.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the list ludics.
For each number i in the list, the code calculates the first ludic number, which is the number itself if it is the first ludic number, or the first ludic number that is greater than i.
The code then removes all the multiples of the first ludic number from the list ludics, starting from the index of the first ludic number.
The code then increments the index by 1 and repeats the process until the index is equal to the length of the list ludics.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ludics, which is a list of the first 10 ludic numbers.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
