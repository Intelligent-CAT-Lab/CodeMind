<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called greet that takes a string as input and returns a string.
The function concatenates the string "Hello, " with the input string and adds an exclamation mark at the end.
The code then calls the greet function with the input "Alice" and prints the return value.
<<<Output>>>
Hello, Alice!
