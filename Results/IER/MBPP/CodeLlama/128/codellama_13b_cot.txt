<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3, and the string str is initialized to "python is a programming language".
The code then splits the string into a list of words using the split() method.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list of words.
For each word x in the list, it checks if the length of x is greater than n (which is 3 in this case). If it is, it appends x to the list word_len.
The loop finishes, and the code returns the list word_len.
<<<Output>>>
['python', 'programming', 'language']
