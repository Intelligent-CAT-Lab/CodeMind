  <<<Analysis>>>
The function lcs_of_three takes three strings X, Y, and Z as input.
The function first calculates the length of each string and stores it in variables m, n, and o, respectively.
The function then initializes a 3D list L with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1) x (o+1) and fills it with 0s.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the 3D list L.
For each index (i, j, k), the function checks if any of the indices is 0. If so, it sets the value of L[i][j][k] to 0.
If none of the indices is 0, the function checks if the characters at the corresponding indices in X, Y, and Z are the same. If they are, it sets the value of L[i][j][k] to the value of L[i-1][j-1][k-1] plus 1.
If the characters are not the same, the function sets the value of L[i][j][k] to the maximum of the values of L[i-1][j][k], L[i][j-1][k], and L[i][j][k-1].
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of L[m][n][o].
