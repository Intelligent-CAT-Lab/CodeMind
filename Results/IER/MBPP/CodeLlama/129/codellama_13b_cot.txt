  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable my_matrix is initialized to the given matrix.
The variable iSize is initialized to the length of the first row of the matrix, which is 4.
The variable sum_list is initialized to an empty list.
The code then calculates the sum of each row and column of the matrix and appends the results to sum_list.
The code then calculates the sum of the main diagonal and the sum of the secondary diagonal and appends the results to sum_list.
The code then checks if the length of the set of sums in sum_list is greater than 1, which means that there are at least two different sums. If this is the case, the code returns False.
If the length of the set of sums is 1, the code returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
