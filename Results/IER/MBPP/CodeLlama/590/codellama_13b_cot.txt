<<<Analysis>>>
The function polar_rect takes two arguments x and y, which are used to create a complex number cn = complex(x,y).
The function cmath.polar is then called on cn to convert it to polar form.
The function cmath.rect is then called on the arguments 2 and cmath.pi to create a new complex number cn1.
The function returns a tuple containing cn and cn1.
<<<Output>>>
(3+4j, 2+2j)
