<<<Analysis>>>
The input_list is a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers.
The code first calculates the maximum length of any sublist in the input_list using the max() function.
The max() function is applied to the list comprehension [len(x) for x in input_list], which calculates the length of each sublist.
The maximum length is 3, which is the length of the sublist [13, 15, 17].
The code then finds the sublist with the maximum length using the max() function with the key parameter set to len(i), which returns the length of each sublist.
The sublist with the maximum length is [13, 15, 17], which is returned as the second element of the tuple.
The first element of the tuple is the maximum length, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
(3, [13, 15, 17])
