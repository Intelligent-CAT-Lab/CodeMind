The function min_product_tuple takes a list of tuples as input.
The code first calculates the absolute value of the product of each tuple element and stores it in a list.
The code then finds the minimum value in this list and returns it.

In this case, the list of tuples is [(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)].
The product of each tuple element is calculated as follows:
(2, 7) -> 14
(2, 6) -> 12
(1, 8) -> 8
(4, 9) -> 36

The absolute values of these products are:
14 -> 14
12 -> 12
8 -> 8
36 -> 36

The minimum value in this list is 8, which is the absolute value of the product of (1, 8).

Therefore, the return value of the function is 8.
<<<Output>>>
