<<<Analysis>>>
The function pack_consecutive_duplicates takes a list as input and returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains consecutive duplicates of the input list.
The function uses the itertools.groupby function to group the input list into consecutive duplicates.
The groupby function takes two arguments: the first is the input list, and the second is a function that defines how to group the elements of the list. In this case, the function is lambda x: x, which means that the elements of the list are grouped based on their value.
The return value of the function is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first is the key used to group the elements, and the second is an iterator over the elements in the group.
The function then uses a list comprehension to create a new list of lists, where each sublist contains the elements of the group.
<<<Output>>>
[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]
