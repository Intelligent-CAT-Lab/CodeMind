<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of lists as input, and returns a dictionary where each key is a tuple of the elements in a sublist, and the value is the number of times that sublist appears in the input list.
The code first initializes an empty dictionary result.
It then iterates over the input list list1, and for each sublist l, it uses the tuple(l) function to convert the sublist to a tuple.
The code then uses the setdefault method of the dictionary to check if the tuple is already a key in the dictionary. If it is not, it adds the key and initializes the value to an empty list.
If the key is already present, it appends the value 1 to the list.
The code then iterates over the dictionary result, and for each key-value pair, it calculates the sum of the values in the list.
Finally, the code returns the result dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{ (1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1, (9, 11): 1 }
