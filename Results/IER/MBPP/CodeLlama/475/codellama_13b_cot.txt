The code imports the Counter class from the collections module.
The function sort_counter takes a dictionary as an argument and returns a list of tuples containing the keys and their corresponding values in descending order.
The code first creates a Counter object x from the input dictionary.
The Counter object has a method called most_common, which returns a list of tuples containing the keys and their corresponding values in descending order.
The code then returns the output of the most_common method.
