The function takes two integer arguments x and y.
The function checks if y is less than 0, if it is, it returns the negative of the result of calling the function with the same arguments but with y as a positive number.
If y is equal to 0, the function returns 0.
If y is equal to 1, the function returns x.
Otherwise, the function returns the result of adding x to the result of calling the function with the same arguments but with y decremented by 1.

The function is called with arguments 10 and 20.
The function checks if 20 is less than 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
