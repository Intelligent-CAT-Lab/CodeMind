  <<<Analysis>>>
The function is_majority takes in an array arr, an integer n, and an integer x.
The function binary_search takes in an array arr, two integers low and high, and an integer x.
The function is_majority first calls the binary_search function to find the index of the element x in the array arr.
If the element is not found, the function returns False.
If the element is found, the function checks if the element is a majority element.
A majority element is an element that appears more than n//2 times in the array.
The function checks if the element is a majority element by checking if the element is in the middle of the array and if the element is equal to x.
If the element is a majority element, the function returns True.
If the element is not a majority element, the function returns False.
