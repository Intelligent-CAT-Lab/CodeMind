The function rgb_to_hsv takes three arguments r, g, and b, which represent the red, green, and blue components of a color, respectively.
The function first normalizes the values of r, g, and b by dividing them by 255.0.
The function then calculates the maximum and minimum values of r, g, and b, and stores them in mx and mn, respectively.
The function then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is stored in df.
The function then calculates the hue, saturation, and value of the color based on the values of r, g, b, mx, mn, and df.
The hue is calculated as follows:
* If mx is equal to mn, the hue is 0.
* If mx is equal to r, the hue is calculated as (60 * ((g-b)/df) + 360) % 360.
* If mx is equal to g, the hue is calculated as (60 * ((b-r)/df) + 120) % 360.
* If mx is equal to b, the hue is calculated as (60 * ((r-g)/df) + 240) % 360.
The saturation is calculated as (df/mx)*100.
The value is calculated as mx*100.
The function then returns the hue, saturation, and value as a tuple.
<<<Output>>>
(0, 0, 100)
