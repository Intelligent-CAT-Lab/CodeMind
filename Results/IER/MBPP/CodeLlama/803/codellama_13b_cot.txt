<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_perfect_square takes an integer n as input.
The function starts by initializing i to 1.
The function then enters a loop that iterates while i * i is less than or equal to n.
For each iteration, the function checks if n is divisible by i and if n / i is equal to i.
If both conditions are met, the function returns True.
If the loop finishes without returning True, the function returns False.

In this case, the loop will iterate 10 times, with i taking on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
For each iteration, the function checks if n is divisible by i and if n / i is equal to i.
For i = 1, the function checks if n is divisible by 1 and if n / 1 is equal to 1. Since n is not divisible by 1, the function moves on to the next iteration.
For i = 2, the function checks if n is divisible by 2 and if n / 2 is equal to 2. Since n is not divisible by 2, the function moves on to the next iteration.
For i = 3, the function checks if n is divisible by 3 and if n / 3 is equal to 3. Since n is not divisible by 3, the function moves on to the next iteration.
For i = 4, the function checks if n is divisible by 4 and if n / 4 is equal to 4. Since n is not divisible by 4, the function moves on to the next iteration.
For i = 5, the function checks if n is divisible by 5 and if n / 5 is equal to 5. Since n is not divisible by 5, the function moves on to the next iteration.
For i = 6, the function checks if n is divisible by 6 and if n / 6 is equal to 6. Since n is not divisible by 6, the function moves on to the next iteration.
For i = 7, the function checks if n is divisible by 7 and if n / 7 is equal to 7. Since n is not divisible by 7, the function moves on to the next iteration.
For i = 8, the function checks if n is divisible by 8 and if n / 8 is equal to 8. Since n is not divisible by 8, the function moves on to the next iteration.
For i = 9, the function checks if n is divisible by 9 and if n / 9 is equal to 9. Since n is not divisible by 9, the function moves on to the next iteration.
For i = 10, the function checks if n is divisible by 10 and if n / 10 is equal to 10. Since n is not divisible by 10, the function moves on to the next iteration.
Since the loop finishes without returning True, the function returns False.
