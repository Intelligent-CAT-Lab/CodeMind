<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of dictionaries as input.
The function first checks if all the dictionaries in the list are empty.
It does this by using the all() function, which returns True if all the elements in the iterable are true.
The iterable is a generator expression that checks if each dictionary in the list is empty.
The generator expression uses the not operator to check if each dictionary is not empty.
The function then returns the result of the all() function, which is True if all the dictionaries are empty, and False otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
True
