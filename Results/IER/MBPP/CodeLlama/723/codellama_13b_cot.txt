The function count_same_pair takes two lists as input, nums1 and nums2.
The function uses the map function to apply the eq operator to each pair of elements in the two lists.
The eq operator returns True if the two elements are equal and False otherwise.
The function then uses the sum function to calculate the total number of True values returned by the eq operator.
The function returns the final result, which is the number of pairs of elements that are equal in both lists.
