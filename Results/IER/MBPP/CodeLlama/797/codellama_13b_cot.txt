The function sum_in_range takes two arguments, l and r, which represent the lower and upper bounds of the range, respectively.
The function first calls the function sum_odd with the argument r, which returns the sum of the odd numbers from 1 to r.
The function then calls the function sum_odd with the argument l - 1, which returns the sum of the odd numbers from 1 to l - 1.
The function then subtracts the second result from the first result to get the sum of the odd numbers in the range [l, r].

The function sum_odd takes a single argument, n, which represents the upper bound of the range.
The function calculates the number of terms in the range by dividing n by 2 and rounding up to the nearest integer.
The function then calculates the sum of the terms by multiplying the number of terms by the square of the number of terms.

In this case, the function sum_in_range is called with the arguments 2 and 5.
The function sum_odd is called with the argument 5, which returns the sum of the odd numbers from 1 to 5, which is 15.
The function sum_odd is called with the argument 2 - 1, which returns the sum of the odd numbers from 1 to 1, which is 1.
The function then subtracts the second result from the first result to get the sum of the odd numbers in the range [2, 5], which is 15 - 1 = 14.
