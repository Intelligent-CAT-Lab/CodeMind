<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of lists as input, and the goal is to count the frequency of each unique element in the flattened list.
The code first flattens the list of lists using a list comprehension.
The variable list1 is assigned the flattened list.
The code then initializes an empty dictionary, dic_data, to store the frequency counts.
The code then iterates over the flattened list, num, and checks if the current element is already in the dictionary.
If it is, the code increments the corresponding value in the dictionary.
If it is not, the code adds the element as a key in the dictionary with a value of 1.
The code then returns the dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}
