  <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of strings as input.
The code first calculates the length of the input list using the len() function.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the indices of the input list.
For each index, the code checks if the string at that index is equal to the string obtained by reversing the string at that index.
If the condition is met, the code adds 1 to the result.
The code then returns the final result.
