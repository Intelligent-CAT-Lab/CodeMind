<<<Analysis>>>
The function surfacearea_cylinder takes two arguments, r and h, which represent the radius and height of a cylinder, respectively.
The function calculates the surface area of the cylinder using the formula:

Surface Area = 2πr^2 + 2πrh

where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.
The function returns the calculated surface area.

In this case, the input values for r and h are 10 and 5, respectively.
