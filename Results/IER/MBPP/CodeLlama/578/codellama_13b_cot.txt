<<<Analysis>>>
The function interleave_lists takes three lists as input and returns a list of interleaved elements.
The code first creates a list of tuples by zipping the three input lists together.
The code then creates a list comprehension that iterates over each tuple in the list of tuples and returns a list of elements.
The final list is returned.

The input to the function is three lists: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [10,20,30,40,50,60,70], and [100,200,300,400,500,600,700].
The output of the function is a list of interleaved elements: [1,10,100,2,20,200,3,30,300,4,40,400,5,50,500,6,60,600,7,70,700].
<<<Output>>>
[1,10,100,2,20,200,3,30,300,4,40,400,5,50,500,6,60,600,7,70,700]
