The function check_min_heap takes an array arr as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the array is a min heap or not.
The function check_min_heap_helper is a helper function that checks if the array is a min heap or not. It takes two arguments: arr, which is the array to be checked, and i, which is the index of the current element being checked.
The function check_min_heap_helper checks if the current element at index i is less than or equal to its left and right children. If it is, it recursively calls itself with the index of the left and right children.
If the current element is not less than or equal to its left and right children, the function returns False.
If the current element is the last element in the array, the function returns True.
The function check_min_heap simply calls the check_min_heap_helper function with the index of the first element in the array.
