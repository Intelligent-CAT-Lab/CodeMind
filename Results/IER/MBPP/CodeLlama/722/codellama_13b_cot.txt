<<<Analysis>>>
The function filter_data takes three arguments: students, h, and w.
The variable students is a dictionary with keys as names and values as tuples of height and weight.
The variables h and w are floats representing the minimum height and weight required for a student to be included in the result.
The function first creates a new dictionary called result, which will contain the filtered data.
It then iterates over the keys of the students dictionary using a dictionary comprehension.
For each key, it checks if the corresponding value (a tuple of height and weight) meets the condition that the height is greater than or equal to h and the weight is greater than or equal to w.
If the condition is met, it adds the key and value to the result dictionary.
Finally, it returns the result dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70), 'Kierra Gentry': (6.0, 68)}
