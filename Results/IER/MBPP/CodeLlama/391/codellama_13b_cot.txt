<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes three lists as input: l1, l2, and l3.
The code first creates a list comprehension that iterates over the three lists simultaneously using the zip() function.
For each iteration, the code creates a dictionary with one key-value pair, where the key is the current element of l1, and the value is another dictionary with one key-value pair, where the key is the current element of l2, and the value is the current element of l3.
The code then returns the list of dictionaries created by the list comprehension.
<<<Output>>>
[{'S001': {'Adina Park': 85}}, {'S002': {'Leyton Marsh': 98}}, {'S003': {'Duncan Boyle': 89}}, {'S004': {'Saim Richards': 92}}]
