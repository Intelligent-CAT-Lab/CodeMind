The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression functionality.
The function capital_words_spaces takes a string argument str1 and returns a modified string.
The function uses the re.sub method to replace all occurrences of a lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter with the same lowercase letter, a space, and the uppercase letter.
The regular expression pattern used is (\w)([A-Z]), which matches a lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter.
The replacement string is \1 \2, which inserts a space between the two matched characters.
The function then returns the modified string.
<<<Output>>>
"P y t h o n"
