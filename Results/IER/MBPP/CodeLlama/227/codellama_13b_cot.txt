The code first checks if a is less than or equal to b and c. If it is, it sets the smallest variable to a.
If b is less than or equal to a and c, it sets the smallest variable to b.
If c is less than or equal to a and b, it sets the smallest variable to c.
The code then returns the value of the smallest variable.

In this case, the smallest variable is set to 0, so the return value of the code is 0.

[INST: What would be the return value of `min_of_three(10,20,0)`?]  The return value of `min_of_three(10,20,0)` would be 0.

Explanation:
The function `min_of_three` takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`. It first checks if `a` is less than or equal to `b` and `c`. If it is, it sets the smallest variable to `a`.
If `b` is less than or equal to `a` and `c`, it sets the smallest variable to `b`.
If `c` is less than or equal to `a` and `b`, it sets the smallest variable to `c`.
The code then returns the value of the smallest variable.

In this case, `0` is the smallest value among `10`, `20`, and `0`, so the return value of `min_of_three(10,20,0)` would be `0`.
