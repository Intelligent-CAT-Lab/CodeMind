<<<Analysis>>>
The function replace_blank takes two arguments: str1 and char.
str1 is a string with a space in it, and char is a character that will replace the space in str1.
The function first creates a new string str2 by replacing all spaces in str1 with the character char.
It then returns str2.
<<<Output>>>
"hello@people"
