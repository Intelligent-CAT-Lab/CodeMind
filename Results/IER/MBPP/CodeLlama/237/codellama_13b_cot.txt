<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of tuples as input.
The code first imports the Counter class from the collections module.
The function then defines a new function called check_occurences, which takes a list of tuples as input.
The function then creates a new dictionary called res, which is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The code then uses the Counter class to count the number of occurrences of each unique element in the input list.
The code then returns the final value of res, which is a dictionary containing the counts of each unique element in the input list.
<<<Output>>>
{(1, 3): 2, (2, 5): 1, (3, 1): 1, (5, 2): 1, (6, 3): 1}
