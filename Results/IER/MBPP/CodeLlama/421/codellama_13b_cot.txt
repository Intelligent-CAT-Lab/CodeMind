The function takes a tuple as input, and the tuple is assigned to the variable test_tup.
The variable delim is initialized to "-".
The code then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of test_tup and concatenate each element with the delimiter delim.
The resulting string is then stored in the variable res.
The code then slices the string res to remove the last delimiter, which is the length of the delimiter.
The final step is to convert the string res to a tuple and return it.
