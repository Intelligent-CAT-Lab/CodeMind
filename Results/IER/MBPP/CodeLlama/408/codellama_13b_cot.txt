<<<Analysis>>>
The function k_smallest_pairs takes three arguments: nums1, nums2, and k.
The function first initializes an empty list called queue.
The function then defines a function called push, which takes two arguments: i and j.
The function push checks if i is less than the length of nums1 and j is less than the length of nums2. If both conditions are true, the function pushes a tuple containing the sum of the elements at indices i and j in nums1 and nums2, along with the indices i and j, to the queue.
The function then calls push with arguments 0 and 0.
The function then initializes an empty list called pairs.
The function then enters a loop that iterates while the queue is not empty and the length of pairs is less than k.
The function pops the first element from the queue and assigns it to a tuple containing the sum of the elements at indices i and j in nums1 and nums2, along with the indices i and j.
The function then appends the tuple to the list pairs.
The function then calls push with arguments i and j + 1.
The function then checks if j is equal to 0. If it is, the function calls push with arguments i + 1 and 0.
The function then returns the list pairs.
