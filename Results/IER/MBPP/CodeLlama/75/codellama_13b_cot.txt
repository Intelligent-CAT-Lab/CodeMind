<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: test_list and K.
test_list is a list of tuples, and K is an integer.
The function returns a list of tuples that meet the condition that all elements in each tuple are divisible by K.
The code first creates a list comprehension that iterates over test_list and checks if all elements in each tuple are divisible by K. If they are, the tuple is added to the resulting list.
The code then returns the resulting list.
