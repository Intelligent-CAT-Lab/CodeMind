<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: list1 and L.
list1 is a list of integers, and L is an integer that represents the index of the element to be removed.
The function returns a new list that is a copy of list1, but with the element at index L removed.

The code first creates a new list that is a copy of list1, using slicing.
The slice [:L-1] selects all elements up to (but not including) the element at index L-1.
The slice [L:] selects all elements starting from the element at index L.
The two slices are then concatenated using the + operator, which creates a new list that contains all elements from list1 except for the element at index L.

The return value of the function is the new list that was created.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 1]
