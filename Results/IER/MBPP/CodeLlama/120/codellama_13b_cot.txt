<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of tuples as input.
The code first calculates the absolute value of the product of each tuple element and stores it in a list.
The code then finds the maximum value in this list and returns it.

In this case, the list of tuples is [(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)].
The product of each tuple element is calculated as follows:

* (2, 7) -> 14
* (2, 6) -> 12
* (1, 8) -> 8
* (4, 9) -> 36

The absolute value of each product is calculated as follows:

* 14 -> 14
* 12 -> 12
* 8 -> 8
* 36 -> 36

The maximum value in this list is 36, which is the return value of the function.
