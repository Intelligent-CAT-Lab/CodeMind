The function cummulative_sum takes a list of tuples as input.
The code first maps the sum function to each tuple in the list, which calculates the sum of each tuple.
The resulting list of sums is then passed to the sum function, which calculates the cumulative sum of the list.
The final result is returned.

In this case, the input list is [(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)].
The sum of each tuple is calculated as follows:

* (1, 3) -> 4
* (5, 6, 7) -> 18
* (2, 6) -> 8

The cumulative sum of the list is then calculated as follows:

* 4 + 18 + 8 = 30

The final output is 30.
