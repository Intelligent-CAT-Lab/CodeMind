<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes an array as input.
The code initializes two variables, i and sum, to 0 and 0, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the array in steps of 2, starting from the first element.
For each element in the array, the code checks if the element is even. If it is, it adds the element to the sum.
The code returns the final value of sum.
