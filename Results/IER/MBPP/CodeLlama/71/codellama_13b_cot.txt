<<<Analysis>>>
The variable nums is initialized to [5, 15, 37, 25, 79].
The variable shrink_fact is initialized to 1.3.
The variable gaps is initialized to len(nums), which is 5.
The variable swapped is initialized to True.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates while gaps > 1 or swapped is True.
The value of gaps is calculated as int(float(gaps) / shrink_fact), which is 5 / 1.3 = 3.7.
The value of swapped is set to False.
The value of i is set to 0.
The code enters a nested loop that iterates while gaps + i < len(nums), which is 3 + 0 = 3.
The code checks if nums[i] > nums[i+gaps], which is 5 > 15, 15 > 37, 37 > 25, and 25 > 79.
The code swaps the values of nums[i] and nums[i+gaps] if the condition is met, which is not in this case.
The value of i is incremented by 1.
The code repeats the nested loop until gaps + i < len(nums) is False.
The code repeats the outer loop until gaps > 1 or swapped is False.
The code returns the final value of nums, which is [5, 15, 37, 25, 79].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 15, 37, 25, 79]
