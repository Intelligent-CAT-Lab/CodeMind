  <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes an array of integers as input.
The function first creates two copies of the input array, MSIBS and MSDBS.
The function then enters two nested loops that iterate over the input array.
The first loop iterates over the array from the beginning to the end, and the second loop iterates over the array from the end to the beginning.
The code checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and if the sum of the current element and the previous element is greater than the current element. If it is, the code updates the current element in the MSIBS and MSDBS arrays.
The code then enters a third loop that iterates over the MSIBS and MSDBS arrays.
The code calculates the maximum sum of the elements in the MSIBS and MSDBS arrays and returns it.
