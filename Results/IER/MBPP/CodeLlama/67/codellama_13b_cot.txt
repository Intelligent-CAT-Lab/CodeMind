<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2, which will be used to determine the size of the matrix.
The code initializes a matrix bell with dimensions (n+1)x(n+1) and sets the value of bell[0][0] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of bell[i][0] using the formula bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to i (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to i.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of bell[i][j] using the formula bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1].
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of bell[n][0], which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
