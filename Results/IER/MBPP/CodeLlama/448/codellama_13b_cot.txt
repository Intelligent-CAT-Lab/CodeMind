  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 9.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 9.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
