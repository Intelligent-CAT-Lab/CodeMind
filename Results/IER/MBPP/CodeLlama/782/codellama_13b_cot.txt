<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes an array arr as input.
The code first calculates the length of the array using the len() function and stores it in variable l.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to l-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider elements from the first to the second-last element of the array.
For each element i in this range, it calculates the sum of the product of the element with the sum of the elements to its right and left.
The code then adds this sum to the variable Sum.
The code repeats this process for each element in the array.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of Sum.
