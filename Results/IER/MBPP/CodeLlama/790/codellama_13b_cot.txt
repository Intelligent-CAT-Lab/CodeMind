The function even_position takes a list of numbers as input.
The function returns True if all the numbers in the list are even or odd, depending on the position of the number in the list.
The function uses the all() function to check if all the numbers in the list meet the condition.
The condition is that the number at a given position is even if the position is even, and odd if the position is odd.
The function uses the range() function to iterate over the positions in the list, and the % operator to check if the position is even or odd.
The function returns True if all the numbers in the list meet the condition, and False otherwise.
