<<<Analysis>>>
The function sector_area takes two arguments, r and a.
The code first imports the math module, which provides the pi constant.
The function then checks if the angle a is greater than 360, and if it is, it returns None.
If the angle is less than or equal to 360, it calculates the area of the sector using the formula (math.pi*r**2) * (a/360).
The code then returns the calculated area.
