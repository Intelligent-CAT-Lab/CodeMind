<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two tuples as input, test_tup1 and test_tup2.
The function uses the zip() function to iterate over the two tuples simultaneously.
The function uses the // operator to perform integer division on each pair of elements from the two tuples.
The result of the division is stored in a new tuple, res.
The function returns the res tuple.

The input to the function is ((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)).
The function performs the following operations:

10 // 5 = 2
4 // 2 = 2
6 // 3 = 2
9 // 3 = 3

The result of the division is stored in the res tuple, which is (2, 2, 2, 3).
The function returns the res tuple, which is (2, 2, 2, 3).
<<<Output>>>
(2, 2, 2, 3)
