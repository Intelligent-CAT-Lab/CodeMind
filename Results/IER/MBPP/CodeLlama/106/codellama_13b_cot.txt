<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: test_list and test_tup.
test_list is a list of integers, and test_tup is a tuple of integers.
The function creates a new list by concatenating test_list and test_tup.
The new list is then converted to a tuple and returned.

In this case, test_list is [5, 6, 7], and test_tup is (9, 10).
The function concatenates test_list and test_tup to create the list [5, 6, 7, 9, 10].
The list is then converted to a tuple, resulting in the tuple (5, 6, 7, 9, 10).

<<<Output>>>
(5, 6, 7, 9, 10)
