<<<Analysis>>>
The function perfect_squares takes two arguments, a and b, which are the lower and upper bounds of the range of numbers to be considered.
The function initializes an empty list called lists, which will be used to store the perfect squares found in the range.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from a to b (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 30.
For each number i in this range, it initializes a variable j to 1 and enters a while loop that iterates as long as j*j is less than or equal to i.
The while loop checks if j*j is equal to i, and if it is, it appends the current number i to the list lists.
The loop then increments j by 1 and continues until j*j is greater than i.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the list lists, which contains the perfect squares found in the range.
