<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes an array as input.
The code first calculates the length of the array using the len() function.
The code then initializes minEle and maxEle to the first element of the array.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (exclusive), meaning it will consider elements from 1 to 3.
For each element i in this range, it calculates the minimum and maximum of minEle and maxEle with the current element arr[i].
After the loop finishes, the code returns the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
