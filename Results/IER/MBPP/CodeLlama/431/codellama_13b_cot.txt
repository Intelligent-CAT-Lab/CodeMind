<<<Analysis>>>
The function common_element takes two lists as input, list1 and list2.
The function first initializes a variable result to False.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of list1.
For each element x in list1, the function enters another loop that iterates over the elements of list2.
For each element y in list2, the function checks if x is equal to y.
If x is equal to y, the function sets result to True and returns result.
The function then exits the loop and returns result.

The function will return True if there is at least one element in common between list1 and list2.
<<<Output>>>
True
