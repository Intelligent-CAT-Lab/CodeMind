The variable test_str is initialized to 'bestinstareels'.
The variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of vowels.
The variable vow_list is initialized to ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to len(test_str) - 1, meaning it will consider all characters in the string except the first and last ones.
For each character at position idx, the code checks if it is not in vow_list and if either the character before or after it is in vow_list. If both conditions are met, it adds 1 to res.
The code also checks if the first character is not in vow_list and the second character is in vow_list, and if the last character is not in vow_list and the second-to-last character is in vow_list.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of res, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
