<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns the sum of the digits of each number in the list.
The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of the input list, and convert each element to a string.
The code then uses the isdigit() method to check if each character in the string is a digit, and if it is, it adds it to the sum.
The code returns the final sum.

In this case, the input list is [10,2,56], and the output is 10+2+5+6=23.
<<<Output>>>
23
