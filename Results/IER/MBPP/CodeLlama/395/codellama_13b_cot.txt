The function first_non_repeating_character takes a string as input and returns the first character that appears only once in the string.
The function first initializes two variables: char_order, which is an empty list, and ctr, which is an empty dictionary.
The function then iterates through each character in the input string using a for loop.
For each character c, the function checks if c is already in ctr. If it is, the function increments the value of c in ctr by 1. If it is not, the function adds c to ctr with a value of 1 and appends c to char_order.
After the loop finishes, the function iterates through each character in char_order using another for loop.
For each character c, the function checks if the value of c in ctr is 1. If it is, the function returns c. If it is not, the function continues to the next character.
Since the input string "abcabc" has no characters that appear only once, the function returns None.
<<<Output>>>
None
