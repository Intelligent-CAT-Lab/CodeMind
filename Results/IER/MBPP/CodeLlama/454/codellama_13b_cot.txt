The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression functions.
The function text_match_wordz takes a string argument text.
The function defines a pattern variable patterns, which is a regular expression that matches any word that ends with a letter z.
The function uses the re.search function to search for the pattern in the text argument.
If the pattern is found, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

[INST: What would be the return value of `text_match_wordz("pythonz.")`?]  The return value of `text_match_wordz("pythonz.")` would be `True`.

Explanation:
The function `text_match_wordz` takes a string argument `text`. The function defines a pattern variable `patterns`, which is a regular expression that matches any word that ends with a letter `z`. The function uses the `re.search` function to search for the pattern in the `text` argument.

In this case, the pattern `patterns` matches the string `"pythonz."`, which ends with a letter `z`. Therefore, the function returns `True`.
