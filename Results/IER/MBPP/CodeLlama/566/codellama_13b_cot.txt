<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a recursive function called sum_digits that takes an integer n as input.
The function first checks if n is equal to 0, and if it is, it returns 0.
If n is not equal to 0, the function calculates the sum of the digits of n by dividing it by 10 and taking the remainder (using the modulo operator).
The function then calls itself with the result of the division as the input, and adds the result to the remainder.
The function continues to call itself until the input is 0, at which point it returns the sum of the digits.

In the case of `sum_digits(345)`, the function would be called with 345 as the input.
The function would divide 345 by 10, which gives 34, and take the remainder, which is 5.
The function would then call itself with 34 as the input, and add the result to 5.
The function would divide 34 by 10, which gives 3, and take the remainder, which is 4.
The function would then call itself with 3 as the input, and add the result to 4.
The function would divide 3 by 10, which gives 0, and take the remainder, which is 3.
The function would then return 3, which would be added to 4 to give 7.
The function would then return 7, which would be added to 5 to give 12.
The function would then return 12, which would be added to 3 to give 15.
The final return value of the function would be 15.

15
