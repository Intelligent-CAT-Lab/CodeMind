<<<Analysis>>>
The function min_Jumps takes two arguments: steps and d.
steps is a tuple of two integers, (a, b), representing the number of steps to reach the end of a staircase.
d is an integer representing the number of jumps the person can make.
The function first assigns the values of a and b to temp and b, respectively.
Then, it updates the values of a and b to be the minimum and maximum of the original values, respectively.
The function then checks if d is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it returns the result of (d + b - 1) / b.
If d is equal to 0, the function returns 0.
If d is equal to a, the function returns 1.
Otherwise, the function returns 2.
