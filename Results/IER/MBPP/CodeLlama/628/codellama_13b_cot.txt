<<<Analysis>>>
The function replace_spaces takes a string as input and replaces all spaces with "%20".
The code first initializes a variable string to the input string.
The code then calls the replace method on the string variable, passing in " " (a space) and "%20" as arguments.
The replace method returns a new string with all occurrences of the first argument (a space) replaced with the second argument ("%20").
The code then returns the new string.
<<<Output>>>
"My%20Name%20is%20Dawood"
