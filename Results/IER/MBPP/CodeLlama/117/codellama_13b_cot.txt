The function takes a list of tuples as input.
The function iterates over each tuple in the list and appends the first element of each tuple to a temporary list called temp.
The function then iterates over each element in the temporary list and checks if it is a string or a float.
If it is a string, the function appends it to the temporary list.
If it is a float, the function appends the float value to the temporary list.
The function then appends the first and second elements of the temporary list to a new list called res.
The function returns the final value of res.

The input list is [("3", "4"), ("1", "26.45"), ("7.32", "8"), ("4", "8")].
The function iterates over each tuple in the list and appends the first element of each tuple to a temporary list called temp.
The temporary list is [3, 1, 7.32, 4].
The function then iterates over each element in the temporary list and checks if it is a string or a float.
If it is a string, the function appends it to the temporary list.
If it is a float, the function appends the float value to the temporary list.
The temporary list is [3, 1, 7.32, 4].
The function then appends the first and second elements of the temporary list to a new list called res.
The final value of res is [(3, 4), (1, 26.45), (7.32, 8), (4, 8)].

<<<Output>>>
[(3, 4), (1, 26.45), (7.32, 8), (4, 8)]
