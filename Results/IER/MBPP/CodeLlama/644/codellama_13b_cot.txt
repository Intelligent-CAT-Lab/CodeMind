<<<Analysis>>>
The function reverse_Array_Upto_K takes two arguments: input and k.
The input is a list of integers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], and k is an integer equal to 4.
The function returns the concatenation of two slices of the input list: input[k-1::-1] and input[k:].
The first slice, input[k-1::-1], starts at index k-1 and goes backwards to index 0, with a step size of -1.
The second slice, input[k:], starts at index k and goes to the end of the list.
The concatenation of these two slices reverses the elements of the list up to index k-1, and then appends the remaining elements in their original order.
Therefore, the return value of the function is [4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]
