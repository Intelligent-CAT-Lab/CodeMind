The variable arr is initialized to [1,1,1,1], and the variable sum is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of arr (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the elements of the array.
For each element i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from i + 1 to the length of arr (exclusive), meaning it will consider all the elements of the array that come after i.
For each pair of elements (i, j) in this range, it checks if arr[i] + arr[j] is equal to sum. If it is, it adds 1 to count.
The condition is met when i is 0 and j is 1, 2, 3, or 4.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of count, which is 4.
