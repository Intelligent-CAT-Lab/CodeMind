<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of tuples as input.
The function first converts the list of tuples to a list of sets, where each set contains the elements of the corresponding tuple.
The function then converts the list of sets to a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the elements of the corresponding set.
The function then sorts each tuple in the list and converts it to a set.
The function then calculates the length of the list of sets, which is the number of unique tuples in the input list.
The function returns the length of the list of sets.

In this case, the input list is [(3, 4), (1, 2), (4, 3), (5, 6)].
The function first converts the list of tuples to a list of sets, which is [{(3, 4)}, {(1, 2)}, {(4, 3)}, {(5, 6)}].
The function then converts the list of sets to a list of tuples, which is [(3, 4), (1, 2), (4, 3), (5, 6)].
The function then sorts each tuple in the list and converts it to a set, which is [{(3, 4)}, {(1, 2)}, {(4, 3)}, {(5, 6)}].
The function then calculates the length of the list of sets, which is 4.
The function returns 4.
