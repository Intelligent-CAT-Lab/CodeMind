The function check_K takes two arguments: test_tup, which is a tuple of integers, and K, which is an integer.
The function iterates through the elements of test_tup using a for loop and checks if any element is equal to K.
If an element is found to be equal to K, the function sets res to True and breaks out of the loop.
If no element is found to be equal to K, the function sets res to False.
The function then returns the value of res.
