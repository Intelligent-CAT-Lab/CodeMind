<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two integer arguments n1 and n2.
The function calculates the absolute difference between n1 and n2, which is 1-2 = -1.
The function then converts the absolute difference to a string, which is "1".
The function then maps each character in the string to its integer equivalent, which is [1].
The function then calculates the sum of the mapped characters, which is 1.
The function returns the sum, which is 1.
