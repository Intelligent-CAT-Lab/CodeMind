The function takes a tuple of numbers as input.
The code first converts the tuple to a string using the join() method.
The join() method takes a separator as an argument, which is an empty string in this case.
The map() function is then used to convert each number in the tuple to a string.
The resulting string is then converted to an integer using the int() function.
The return value of the function is the integer value of the string.
