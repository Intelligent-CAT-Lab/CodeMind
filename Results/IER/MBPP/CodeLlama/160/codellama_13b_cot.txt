<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes three arguments: a, b, and n.
The function starts by initializing i to 0.
The while loop starts by checking if i * a is less than or equal to n.
If it is, the function calculates (n - (i * a)) % b and checks if it is equal to 0.
If it is, the function returns a tuple containing i and (n - (i * a)) // b.
If the loop finishes without returning a value, the function returns None.

In this case, the loop will run for i = 0, 1, 2, and 3.
For i = 0, (0 * 2) <= 7 is false, so the loop does not execute.
For i = 1, (1 * 2) <= 7 is true, but (7 - (1 * 2)) % 3 is not equal to 0, so the loop does not execute.
For i = 2, (2 * 2) <= 7 is true, and (7 - (2 * 2)) % 3 is equal to 0, so the function returns (2, 1).
For i = 3, (3 * 2) <= 7 is true, but (7 - (3 * 2)) % 3 is not equal to 0, so the loop does not execute.

Therefore, the return value of find_solution(2, 3, 7) is (2, 1).
