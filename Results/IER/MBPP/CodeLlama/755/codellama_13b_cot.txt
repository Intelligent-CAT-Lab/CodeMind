<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of numbers as input.
The first step is to remove duplicates from the list using the set() function.
The resulting list is sorted using the sort() function.
The function then checks if the length of the list is less than 2. If it is, it returns None.
If the length is greater than or equal to 2, it returns the second element of the list.
In this case, the list after removing duplicates and sorting is [-8, -2, 0, 1, 2].
The second element of this list is -2, which is the second smallest number in the original list.
<<<Output>>>
-2
