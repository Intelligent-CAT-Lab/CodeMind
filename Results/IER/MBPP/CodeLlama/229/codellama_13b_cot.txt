<<<Analysis>>>
The function re_arrange_array takes two arguments: an array arr and an integer n.
The function first initializes a variable j to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code checks if the element at the current index i is less than 0.
If it is, the code swaps the element at index i with the element at index j.
It then increments j by 1.
The loop continues until it reaches the end of the array.
The function then returns the modified array.

Based on the analysis, the return value of the function would be [-1, -3, -7, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9].
<<<Output>>>
[-1, -3, -7, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
