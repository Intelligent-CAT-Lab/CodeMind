 
The output of the code is:

Hello, Alice!

The function `greet` takes a string `name` as an argument and returns a string that says "Hello, " followed by the name and an exclamation mark. The `print` function is then called with the result of `greet("Alice")` as its argument, which is "Hello, Alice!". Therefore, the output of the code is "Hello, Alice!".
