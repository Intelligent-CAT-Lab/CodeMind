<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a regular expression that matches strings that start with a lowercase letter or contain a repeated lowercase letter.
The function check_char takes a string as input and uses the re.search function to check if the string matches the regular expression.
If the string matches the regular expression, the function returns "Valid". Otherwise, it returns "Invalid".

The regular expression is:
^[a-z]$|^([a-z]).*\1$

This regular expression can be broken down as follows:
^[a-z]$ matches strings that start with a lowercase letter.
^([a-z]).*\1$ matches strings that contain a repeated lowercase letter. The parentheses capture the first occurrence of a lowercase letter, and the \1 backreference matches the same character.

The function check_char is called with the string "abba" as input.
The regular expression matches the string "abba" because it contains a repeated lowercase letter "b".
The function returns "Valid" because the string matches the regular expression.
<<<Output>>>
Valid
