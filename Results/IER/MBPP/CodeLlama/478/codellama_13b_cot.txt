The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression functionality.
The function remove_lowercase takes a string argument str1 and returns a new string with all lowercase letters removed.
The code uses the re.sub function to replace all lowercase letters in str1 with an empty string.
The regular expression pattern used is '[a-z]', which matches any lowercase letter.
The replacement string is an empty string, which means that all lowercase letters are removed from the input string.
The function returns the modified string.
