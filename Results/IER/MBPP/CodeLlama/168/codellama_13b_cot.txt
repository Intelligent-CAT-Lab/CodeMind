The function frequency takes two arguments, a list a and an integer x.
The function first initializes a variable count to 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the list a.
For each element i in the list, the function checks if i is equal to x.
If i is equal to x, the function increments the variable count by 1.
The function then returns the value of count.

In this case, the list a is [1,2,3] and the integer x is 4.
The function will iterate over the elements of the list and find that none of them are equal to 4.
Therefore, the function will return 0.
