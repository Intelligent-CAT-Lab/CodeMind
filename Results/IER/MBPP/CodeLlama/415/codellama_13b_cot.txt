<<<Analysis>>>
The function max_Product takes an array arr as input.
The function first checks if the length of the array is less than 2, if it is, it returns the string "No pairs exists".
If the length of the array is greater than or equal to 2, it initializes two variables x and y to the first two elements of the array.
The function then enters a nested loop that iterates over the array from index 0 to the length of the array (exclusive).
For each iteration, the loop iterates over the array from the current index to the length of the array (exclusive).
For each iteration, the loop checks if the product of the current element and the next element is greater than the product of x and y.
If it is, the loop updates x and y to the current element and the next element, respectively.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the values of x and y.
