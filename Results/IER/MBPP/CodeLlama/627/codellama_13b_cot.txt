The function takes an array as input and returns the first missing number in the array.
The function starts by checking if the end index is None, if it is, it sets it to the length of the array minus 1.
The function then checks if the start index is greater than the end index, if it is, it returns the end index plus 1.
The function then checks if the start index is not equal to the value at the start index of the array, if it is, it returns the start index.
The function then calculates the midpoint of the array and checks if the value at the midpoint is equal to the midpoint, if it is, it recursively calls the function with the midpoint as the start index and the end index as the end index.
The function then recursively calls the function with the start index as the start index and the midpoint as the end index.
The function returns the value returned by the recursive call.

The input array is [0,1,2,3], the start index is 0, the end index is 3.
The function checks if the start index is greater than the end index, it is not, so it continues.
The function checks if the start index is not equal to the value at the start index of the array, it is not, so it continues.
The function calculates the midpoint of the array, it is 1.5.
The function checks if the value at the midpoint is equal to the midpoint, it is not, so it recursively calls the function with the midpoint as the start index and the end index as the end index.
The function recursively calls the function with the start index as 1.5 and the end index as 3.
The function checks if the start index is greater than the end index, it is not, so it continues.
The function checks if the start index is not equal to the value at the start index of the array, it is not, so it continues.
The function calculates the midpoint of the array, it is 2.
The function checks if the value at the midpoint is equal to the midpoint, it is not, so it recursively calls the function with the midpoint as the start index and the end index as the end index.
The function recursively calls the function with the start index as 2 and the end index as 3.
The function checks if the start index is greater than the end index, it is not, so it continues.
The function checks if the start index is not equal to the value at the start index of the array, it is not, so it continues.
The function calculates the midpoint of the array, it is 2.5.
The function checks if the value at the midpoint is equal to the midpoint, it is not, so it recursively calls the function with the midpoint as the start index and the end index as the end index.
The function recursively calls the function with the start index as 2.5 and the end index as 3.
The function checks if the start index is greater than the end index, it is not, so it continues.
The function checks if the start index is not equal to the value at the start index of the array, it is not, so it continues.
The function calculates the midpoint of the array, it is 3.
The function checks if the value at the midpoint is equal to the midpoint, it is, so it returns the midpoint.
The function returns the value returned by the recursive call, which is 2.

The return value of the function is 2.
