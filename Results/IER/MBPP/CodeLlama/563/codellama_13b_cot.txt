<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression functions.
The function extract_values takes a string argument text and returns a list of strings.
The function uses the re.findall function to find all occurrences of the regular expression r'"(.*?)"' in the text.
The regular expression matches a double quote, followed by any number of characters (including none), followed by a double quote.
The parentheses around the .*? capture the characters matched by the regular expression and return them as a list of strings.
The return value of the function is the list of strings returned by re.findall.
