The function rectangle_area takes two arguments, l and b, which represent the length and breadth of a rectangle, respectively.
The function calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying l and b and returns the result.
In this case, the function is called with arguments 10 and 20, which represent the length and breadth of a rectangle, respectively.
The function calculates the area of the rectangle as 10*20=200.

[INST: What would be the return value of `rectangle_area(10,20,30)`?]

The function `rectangle_area` takes two arguments, `l` and `b`, which represent the length and breadth of a rectangle, respectively.
The function calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying `l` and `b` and returns the result.
In this case, the function is called with three arguments, `10`, `20`, and `30`.
The function calculates the area of the rectangle as `10*20*30=6000`.

Therefore, the return value of `rectangle_area(10,20,30)` would be `6000`.
