<<<Analysis>>>
The function consecutive_duplicates takes a list of numbers as input.
The function uses the itertools.groupby function to group the numbers based on their consecutive duplicates.
The function then returns a list of the keys of the groups, which are the consecutive duplicates.
In this case, the input list is [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4].
The function groups the numbers as follows:
[0, 0]
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4, 4]
[5]
[6, 6, 6]
[7]
[8]
[9]
[4, 4]
The function returns the keys of the groups, which are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]
