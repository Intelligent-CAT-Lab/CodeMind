<<<Analysis>>>
The function `occurance_substring` takes two arguments: `text` and `pattern`.
The function uses the `re` module to find all occurrences of the pattern in the text.
The function then iterates over the matches and returns a tuple containing the matched substring, its start index, and its end index.

In this case, the function will return the following tuples:

* ('python', 0, 6)
* ('python', 14, 20)

The function will return the last tuple, which is ('python', 14, 20).

<<<Output>>>
('python', 14, 20)
