The variable n is initialized to 10, which is the input to the function.
The code then imports the math module and defines a function called count_divisors.
The function takes an integer n as input and initializes a variable count to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of n (inclusive), which is 3 in this case.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it checks if n divided by i is equal to i. If it is, it adds 1 to count. If it is not, it adds 2 to count.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of count, which is 2.
