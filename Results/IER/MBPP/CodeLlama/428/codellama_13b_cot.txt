  <<<Analysis>>>
The function shell_sort takes a list as input and sorts it using the shell sort algorithm.
The algorithm starts by dividing the list into sublists of size gap, where gap is initially set to the length of the list divided by 2.
The algorithm then iterates through each sublist, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if necessary to sort the sublist.
The gap is then divided by 2 and the process is repeated until the gap is 0.
The function then returns the sorted list.

In this case, the input list is [12, 23, 4, 5, 3, 2, 12, 81, 56, 95].
The algorithm starts by dividing the list into sublists of size 5, since 10 / 2 = 5.
The first sublist is [12, 23, 4, 5, 3].
The algorithm then iterates through this sublist, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if necessary.
The first comparison is between 12 and 23, which are already in order, so no swapping is done.
The next comparison is between 4 and 5, which are also in order, so no swapping is done.
The next comparison is between 3 and 2, which are not in order, so the algorithm swaps them.
The final sublist is [3, 4, 5, 12, 23].
The algorithm then divides the gap by 2, so the next sublist is [3, 4, 5].
The algorithm iterates through this sublist, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if necessary.
The first comparison is between 3 and 4, which are not in order, so the algorithm swaps them.
The final sublist is [4, 3, 5].
The algorithm then divides the gap by 2 again, so the next sublist is [4, 3].
The algorithm iterates through this sublist, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if necessary.
The first comparison is between 4 and 3, which are not in order, so the algorithm swaps them.
The final sublist is [3, 4].
The algorithm then divides the gap by 2 again, so the next sublist is [3].
The algorithm iterates through this sublist, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if necessary.
The first comparison is between 3 and 3, which are already in order, so no swapping is done.
The final sublist is [3].
The algorithm then divides the gap by 2 again, so the next sublist is [].
The algorithm then returns the sorted list, which is [2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 23, 34, 56, 81, 95].
