The variable h_age is initialized to 12.
The code checks if h_age is less than 0, which is not the case.
The code then checks if h_age is less than or equal to 2, which is not the case.
The code then enters the else block and calculates the dog age as 21 + (h_age - 2)*4.
The dog age is calculated as 21 + (12 - 2)*4 = 21 + 10*4 = 21 + 40 = 61.
The code returns the dog age, which is 61.
