The variable string is initialized to "11000010001".
The variable n is initialized to the length of the string, which is 11.
The variable current_sum is initialized to 0.
The variable max_sum is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider each character in the string.
For each character i in the string, it checks if it is equal to '0', and if it is, it adds 1 to current_sum. If it is not equal to '0', it subtracts 1 from current_sum.
If current_sum falls below 0, it is set to 0.
The code then checks if the current_sum is greater than the max_sum, and if it is, it updates the max_sum.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of max_sum, which is 3.
