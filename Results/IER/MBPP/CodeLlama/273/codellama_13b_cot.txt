<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two tuples as input, test_tup1 and test_tup2.
The function first creates a new tuple res by applying the lambda function to each element of test_tup1 and test_tup2.
The lambda function takes two arguments, i and j, and returns the difference between them.
The function then returns the tuple res.

In this case, the input to the function is ((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)).
The function will first create a new tuple res by applying the lambda function to each element of the input tuples.
The lambda function will subtract the second element of test_tup2 from the second element of test_tup1, and so on.
The resulting tuple res will be (-8, -1, -13).

Therefore, the return value of the function will be (-8, -1, -13).
<<<Output>>>
(-8, -1, -13)
