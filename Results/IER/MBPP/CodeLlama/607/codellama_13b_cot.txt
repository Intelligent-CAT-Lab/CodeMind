<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_literals` takes two arguments: `text` and `pattern`.
The function uses the `re` module to search for the pattern in the text.
The `re.search` function returns a match object if the pattern is found in the text.
The function then extracts the start and end indices of the match using the `start()` and `end()` methods of the match object.
Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the pattern, start index, and end index of the match.

In this case, the pattern is 'fox', and the text is 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'.
The function will find the first occurrence of 'fox' in the text, which is at index 14.
The start index of the match is 14, and the end index is 17.
The function will return the tuple ('fox', 14, 17).
<<<Output>>>
('fox', 14, 17)
