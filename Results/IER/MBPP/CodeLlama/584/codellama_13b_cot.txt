<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression functionality.
The function find_adverbs takes a string argument text and returns a string.
The function uses the re.finditer function to find all occurrences of the pattern "\w+ly" in the text.
The pattern matches any word character (alphanumeric or underscore) followed by the letter "ly".
The function then iterates over the matches using a for loop and returns a string in the format "%d-%d: %s" where %d-%d represents the start and end indices of the match, and %s represents the matched string.
<<<Output>>>
0-4: clearly
12-16: no
20-24: such
