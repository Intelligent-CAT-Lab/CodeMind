<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 35.
The code imports the math module, which provides functions for mathematical operations.
The code defines a function called next_Perfect_Square that takes an integer N as input.
The function calculates the next perfect square of N using the following steps:
1. It calculates the square root of N using the math.sqrt function.
2. It rounds the result down to the nearest integer using the math.floor function.
3. It adds 1 to the result to get the next integer.
4. It multiplies the result by itself to get the next perfect square.
The function returns the result of this calculation.

Based on the analysis, the return value of next_Perfect_Square(35) would be 49.
<<<Output>>>
49
