<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2, which is a prime number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 1.414 (rounded up to 2).
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i.
The loop will only run once, with i being 2.
The code checks if n is divisible by 2, which it is not.
The loop finishes and the code returns False, indicating that n is not a composite number.
<<<Output>>>
False
