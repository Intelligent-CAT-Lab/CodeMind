<<<Analysis>>>
The function check_smaller takes two tuples as input, test_tup1 and test_tup2.
The function returns True if all the elements in test_tup1 are greater than the corresponding elements in test_tup2.
The function uses the built-in function all() to check if all the elements in the tuple returned by the generator expression (x > y for x, y in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2)) are True.
The generator expression zips the two tuples together and compares the corresponding elements.
The function returns False if any of the elements in the tuple returned by the generator expression are False.
<<<Output>>>
False
