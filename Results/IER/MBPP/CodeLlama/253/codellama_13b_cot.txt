The variable list1 is initialized to [1,2,'abc',1.2].
The code enters a loop that iterates over the elements of list1.
For each element i in list1, it checks if i is an instance of int.
The condition is met when i is 1 and 2, which are both integers.
The code increments the variable ctr by 1 for each integer it finds.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ctr, which is 2.
