The function power takes two arguments, a and b.
The function first checks if b is equal to 0, if it is, it returns 1.
The function then checks if a is equal to 0, if it is, it returns 0.
The function then checks if b is equal to 1, if it is, it returns a.
If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns a*power(a,b-1).

In this case, the function is called with a=3 and b=4.
The function first checks if b is equal to 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function then checks if a is equal to 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function then checks if b is equal to 1, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function then returns a*power(a,b-1), which is 3*power(3,3).

The function is called with a=3 and b=3.
The function first checks if b is equal to 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function then checks if a is equal to 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function then checks if b is equal to 1, which it is, so it returns a, which is 3.

The function is called with a=3 and b=2.
The function first checks if b is equal to 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function then checks if a is equal to 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function then checks if b is equal to 1, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function then returns a*power(a,b-1), which is 3*power(3,1).

The function is called with a=3 and b=1.
