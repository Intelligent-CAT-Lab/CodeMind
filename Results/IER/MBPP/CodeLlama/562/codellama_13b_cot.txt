The function Find_Max_Length takes a list of lists as input.
The code first calculates the maximum length of the sublists in the input list using the max function.
The max function takes an iterable of numbers and returns the largest number in the iterable.
In this case, the iterable is the list of lengths of the sublists in the input list.
The code then returns the maximum length.
