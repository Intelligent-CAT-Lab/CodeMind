The function smallest_num takes a list of numbers as input and returns the smallest number in the list.
The code first defines a function called smallest_num that takes a list of numbers as input.
The function then returns the smallest number in the list using the min function.
The min function returns the smallest item in an iterable.
The code then defines a list called xs with the values [10, 20, 1, 45, 99].
The function smallest_num is then called with the list xs as input.
The function returns the smallest number in the list, which is 1.
