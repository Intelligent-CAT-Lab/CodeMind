The function takes an integer n as input and returns an integer.
The function body consists of a single expression that is evaluated and returned.
The expression is:
(6 * n * (n - 1) + 1)

The expression is evaluated as follows:

1. The product of 6 and n is calculated, which is 6 * n.
2. The product of the result from step 1 and (n - 1) is calculated, which is 6 * n * (n - 1).
3. The result from step 2 is added to 1, which is 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1.

The final result is returned as the output of the function.
