The function union_elements takes two tuples as input, test_tup1 and test_tup2.
The function first concatenates the two tuples using the + operator.
The function then converts the resulting tuple into a set using the set() function.
The function then converts the set back into a tuple using the tuple() function.
The function finally returns the resulting tuple.

The input to the function is ((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)).
The concatenation of the two tuples results in the tuple (3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7, 4, 10).
The set of this tuple is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10}.
The tuple of this set is (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10).
The function returns this tuple.

<<<Output>>>
(3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)
