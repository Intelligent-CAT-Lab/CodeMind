The function count_Occurrence takes two arguments: a tuple tup and a list lst.
The function iterates through the elements of the tuple tup and checks if each element is in the list lst.
If an element is in lst, the function increments the variable count by 1.
The function returns the final value of count.

In this case, the tuple tup is ('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd') and the list lst is ['a', 'b'].
The function iterates through the elements of tup and checks if each element is in lst.
The elements 'a' and 'b' are in lst, so the function increments count by 2.
The function returns the final value of count, which is 2.
