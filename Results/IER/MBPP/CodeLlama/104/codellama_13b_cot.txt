<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of lists as input.
The code first defines a lambda function that takes a list as input and returns the first element of the list.
The code then uses a list comprehension to apply the lambda function to each sublist in the input list.
The result is a list of sorted sublists, where each sublist is sorted based on the first element.
<<<Output>>>
[['black', 'white'], ['green', 'orange'], ['orange', 'white', 'black']]
