<<<Analysis>>>
The variable dlist is initialized to [11,23,58,31,56,77,43,12,65,19], and the variable item is initialized to 31.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the list dlist, starting from the first element (pos = 0).
The loop checks if the current element (dlist[pos]) is equal to the item (31). If it is, the variable found is set to True, and the loop exits.
If the current element is not equal to the item, the loop increments pos by 1 and continues.
The loop continues until pos is greater than or equal to the length of the list (pos < len(dlist) is False).
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of found, which is True.
The second value returned by the function is the position of the item in the list, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
(True, 3)
