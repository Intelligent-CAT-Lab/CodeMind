The variable nums is initialized to [0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8].
The variable n is initialized to the length of nums, which is 13.
The variable n1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of positive numbers in nums.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element x in nums.
For each element x, the code checks if x is greater than 0. If it is, it adds 1 to n1. If it is not, it does nothing.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of n1 divided by n, rounded to 2 decimal places.
Since there are 7 positive numbers in nums (1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 6, 8), the return value will be 7/13, which is approximately 0.52.
<<<Output>>>
0.52
