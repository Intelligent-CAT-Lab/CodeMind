<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_rotation` is designed to find the number of rotations in a sorted array that has been rotated. The input array is `[3,2,1]`.
The function starts a loop that iterates from index 1 to the length of the array minus one.
On the first iteration, `i` is 1, and the function checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. In this case, `arr[1]` is 2 and `arr[0]` is 3. Since 2 is less than 3, the condition is met.
The function immediately returns the current index `i`, which is 1.
The loop does not continue because the function has already returned a value.
Therefore, the return value of `count_rotation([3,2,1])` is 1, indicating that the array has been rotated once from its original sorted order.
