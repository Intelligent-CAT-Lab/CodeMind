The function `remove_kth_element` is called with the list `[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1]` and the integer `L` set to 3.
The function aims to remove the element at the k-th position (where k is `L`) from the list.
The code uses list slicing to create a new list that consists of all elements before the k-th element (`list1[:L-1]`) and all elements after the k-th element (`list1[L:]`).
Since `L` is 3, `L-1` is 2. The slice `list1[:L-1]` will include elements at indices 0 and 1, which are `[1,1]`.
The slice `list1[L:]` will include elements from index 3 to the end, which are `[3,4,4,5,1]`.
The two slices are concatenated, resulting in `[1,1] + [3,4,4,5,1]`.
The final list, after removing the element at the 3rd position (which is the number 2), is `[1,1,3,4,4,5,1]`.
<<<Output>>>
[1,1,3,4,4,5,1]
