<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 1212121 and then converted to a string.
The function checks if the length of n is less than or equal to 2. Since the length of '1212121' is 7, the condition is False, and the function proceeds.
The code then enters a loop that starts at index 2 and goes up to the length of the string n.
In each iteration, the code checks if the digit two places before the current index is the same as the digit at the current index.
For the given number '1212121', the digits at indices 0 and 2 are the same ('1'), as are the digits at indices 1 and 3 ('2'), and so on.
Since all pairs of digits two places apart are the same, the function never returns False within the loop.
After the loop finishes without returning False, the function returns True, indicating that the number is undulating.
