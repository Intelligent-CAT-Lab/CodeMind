<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 70.
The function check(n) is called with n = 70.
Inside check, the function rev(num) is called with num = 70.
The rev function initializes rev_num to 0.
The while loop runs as long as num is greater than 0.
In the first iteration, rev_num becomes (0 * 10 + 70 % 10) which is 0 + 0 = 0, and num becomes 70 // 10 which is 7.
In the second iteration, rev_num becomes (0 * 10 + 7 % 10) which is 0 + 7 = 7, and num becomes 7 // 10 which is 0.
The while loop ends because num is now 0.
The rev function returns rev_num which is 7.
Back in the check function, it checks if 2 * rev(n) is equal to n + 1.
This means it checks if 2 * 7 is equal to 70 + 1.
2 * 7 is 14, and 70 + 1 is 71.
Since 14 is not equal to 71, the check function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
