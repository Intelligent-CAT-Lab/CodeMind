<<<Analysis>>>
The function `magic_square_test` is designed to check if a given 2D square matrix is a magic square. A magic square is a square grid with distinct positive integers in each cell such that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and both main diagonals is the same.

The input matrix is:
[[7, 12, 1, 14],
 [2, 13, 8, 11],
 [16, 3, 10, 5],
 [9, 6, 15, 4]]

The variable `iSize` is initialized to the size of the first row of the matrix, which is 4.

The variable `sum_list` is initialized to an empty list, which will store the sums of each row, each column, and the two main diagonals.

The first for loop calculates the sum of each row and extends `sum_list` with these values. The sums of the rows are:
Row 1: 7 + 12 + 1 + 14 = 34
Row 2: 2 + 13 + 8 + 11 = 34
Row 3: 16 + 3 + 10 + 5 = 34
Row 4: 9 + 6 + 15 + 4 = 34

The second for loop calculates the sum of each column and appends these values to `sum_list`. The sums of the columns are:
Column 1: 7 + 2 + 16 + 9 = 34
Column 2: 12 + 13 + 3 + 6 = 34
Column 3: 1 + 8 + 10 + 15 = 34
Column 4: 14 + 11 + 5 + 4 = 34

The next section of the code calculates the sum of the first diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and appends it to `sum_list`. The sum is:
Diagonal 1: 7 + 13 + 10 + 4 = 34

The following section calculates the sum of the second diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) and appends it to `sum_list`. The sum is:
Diagonal 2: 14 + 8 + 3 + 9 = 34

Finally, the code checks if all the sums in `sum_list` are the same by converting it to a set and checking its length. If the length is greater than 1, it means not all sums are equal, and the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

In this case, all sums are equal to 34, so the length of the set of `sum_list` is 1, indicating that the input matrix is a magic square.
