<<<Analysis>>>
The function `last_Digit` takes an integer `n` as its argument.
The code calculates `n % 10`, which is the remainder of `n` divided by 10. This effectively gives the last digit of the number.
For the input `123`, `123 % 10` equals `3`, which is the last digit of the number.
Therefore, the function will return `3`.
