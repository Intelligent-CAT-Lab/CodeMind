<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 12.
The number 12 is converted to a list of its digits: nums = ['1', '2'].
The code enters a loop that iterates from the second-to-last index of nums to the beginning (from index 0 to 0 in this case).
The loop checks if the current digit is less than the digit following it. Since there are only two digits, it checks if '1' < '2', which is true.
The sublist from the current digit to the end is stored in z: z = ['1', '2'].
The code finds the minimum digit in z that is greater than the first digit of z (y = '2').
It removes y from z, which now becomes z = ['1'].
It sorts z, but since z has only one element, it remains unchanged: z = ['1'].
The digits in nums are replaced from the current index i to the end with the list [y] + z, resulting in nums = ['2', '1'].
The list nums is joined to form a string and then converted to an integer: int("21").
The function returns this integer, 21, which is the next bigger number that can be formed by rearranging the digits of 12.
If no such rearrangement was possible, the function would return False, but in this case, it is possible.
<<<Output>>>
21
