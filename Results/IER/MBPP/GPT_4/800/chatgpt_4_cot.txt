<<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_all_spaces` is defined with one parameter, `text`.
The function uses the `re.sub` method from the `re` (regular expression) module to replace all sequences of whitespace characters in the input string with an empty string.
The regular expression pattern `r'\s+'` matches one or more whitespace characters (including spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.).
The input string `'python  program'` contains a sequence of two spaces between the words "python" and "program".
The `re.sub` method will replace this sequence of spaces with an empty string, effectively removing all spaces from the input string.
The function will return the modified string without any spaces.
<<<Output>>>
'pythonprogram'
