<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_star_num` takes a single argument `n`, which is initialized to 3.
The function calculates the value of the expression `(6 * n * (n - 1) + 1)`.
Substituting the value of `n` with 3, the expression becomes `(6 * 3 * (3 - 1) + 1)`.
This simplifies to `(6 * 3 * 2 + 1)`, which is `(36 + 1)`.
The final result of the expression is `37`.
The function returns this value.
<<<Output>>>
37
