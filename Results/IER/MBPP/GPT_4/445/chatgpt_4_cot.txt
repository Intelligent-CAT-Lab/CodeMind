The function `index_multiplication` takes two tuples of tuples as arguments, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
The variable `test_tup1` is initialized to `((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10))`.
The variable `test_tup2` is initialized to `((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))`.
The function creates a new tuple `res` by multiplying corresponding elements from the sub-tuples of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
The `zip` function is used to pair up the sub-tuples from `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` and then to pair up the individual elements from these sub-tuples.
The multiplication is done element-wise:
- The first sub-tuple from `test_tup1` is `(1, 3)` and from `test_tup2` is `(6, 7)`. Their product is `(1*6, 3*7)` which is `(6, 21)`.
- The second sub-tuple from `test_tup1` is `(4, 5)` and from `test_tup2` is `(3, 9)`. Their product is `(4*3, 5*9)` which is `(12, 45)`.
- The third sub-tuple from `test_tup1` is `(2, 9)` and from `test_tup2` is `(1, 1)`. Their product is `(2*1, 9*1)` which is `(2, 9)`.
- The fourth sub-tuple from `test_tup1` is `(1, 10)` and from `test_tup2` is `(7, 3)`. Their product is `(1*7, 10*3)` which is `(7, 30)`.
The final result `res` is a tuple of these products: `((6, 21), (12, 45), (2, 9), (7, 30))`.
