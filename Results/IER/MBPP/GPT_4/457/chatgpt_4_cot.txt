<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Find_Min` is defined to take a single argument `lst`, which is expected to be a list of lists.
The function returns the element of `lst` with the minimum length, determined by the `len` function used as the key in the `min` function.
The input provided to the function is `[[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]`.
The lengths of the sublists are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
The `min` function will find the sublist with the smallest length, which is `[1]`.
Therefore, the function will return `[1]`.
