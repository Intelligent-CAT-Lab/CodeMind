<<<Analysis>>>
The function `list_tuple` takes a single argument, which is expected to be a list. In this case, the input list is `[5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]`.
Inside the function, the list is converted to a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor.
The tuple created from the list is `(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`.
The function then returns this tuple.
<<<Output>>>
(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)
