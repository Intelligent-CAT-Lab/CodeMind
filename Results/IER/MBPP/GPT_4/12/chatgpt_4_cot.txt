<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_matrix` takes a matrix M as input, which is a list of lists.
The input matrix M is `[[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]]`.
The `sorted` function is used to sort the matrix based on the sum of the elements in each row (sublist).
The `key=sum` argument tells the `sorted` function to use the sum of the elements in each sublist as the sorting key.
The sums of the elements for each sublist are as follows:
- For `[1, 2, 3]`, the sum is `6`.
- For `[2, 4, 5]`, the sum is `11`.
- For `[1, 1, 1]`, the sum is `3`.
The rows will be sorted in ascending order based on these sums, so the sorted matrix will be `[[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]`.
The function returns the sorted matrix.
<<<Output>>>
[[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]
