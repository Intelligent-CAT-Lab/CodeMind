<<<Analysis>>>
The function `last` is designed to find the last occurrence of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`.

- The array `arr` is initialized to [1,2,3], and `x` is initialized to 1.
- The variable `n` is set to the length of `arr`, which is 3.
- The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to 0 and `n - 1` (which is 2), respectively.
- The variable `res` is initialized to -1, which will hold the result (the last index of `x` in `arr`).

The function enters a while loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

- In the first iteration, `mid` is calculated as `(0 + 2) // 2`, which is 1.
- Since `arr[mid]` (which is `arr[1]` or 2) is greater than `x` (which is 1), the `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, which is 0.
- The loop continues because `low` (0) is still less than or equal to `high` (0).

In the second iteration:
- `mid` is recalculated as `(0 + 0) // 2`, which is 0.
- Since `arr[mid]` (which is `arr[0]` or 1) is equal to `x` (which is 1), `res` is updated to `mid`, which is 0.
- `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, which is 1.

The loop ends because `low` (1) is now greater than `high` (0).

The function returns the value of `res`, which is the last index where `x` was found in `arr`. In this case, `res` is 0, as 1 only occurs once at the beginning of the array.
