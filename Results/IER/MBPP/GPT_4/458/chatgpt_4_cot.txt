<<<Analysis>>>
The function `rectangle_area` takes two parameters, `l` and `b`, which represent the length and breadth of a rectangle, respectively.
The variables `l` and `b` are initialized to 10 and 20.
The code calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length `l` by the breadth `b`, which is `10 * 20`.
The result of the multiplication is stored in the variable `area`.
The function then returns the value of `area`, which is the area of the rectangle.
The return value of `rectangle_area(10,20)` is therefore 200.
<<<Output>>>
200
