<<<Analysis>>>
The function `min_Jumps` takes a tuple `steps` and an integer `d` as its parameters. The tuple `steps` contains two integers representing the possible steps one can take, and `d` is the distance to be covered.

The tuple `steps` is unpacked into variables `a` and `b`, with `a` being assigned the first element (3) and `b` being assigned the second element (4).

The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `a` (3).

The `min` function is used to assign the minimum of `a` and `b` to `a`, which will still be 3 since `a` is already the smaller value.

The `max` function is used to assign the maximum of `temp` (which was `a` initially) and `b` to `b`, which will be 4 since `b` is already the larger value.

The first `if` statement checks if `d` (11) is greater than or equal to `b` (4), which is true. Therefore, the function will return `(d + b - 1) / b`.

The calculation will be `(11 + 4 - 1) / 4`, which simplifies to `14 / 4`.

The division of 14 by 4 is 3.5, which is the number of jumps needed to cover the distance `d` (11) using the larger step size `b` (4).

Since the function is expected to return an integer number of jumps, and it's not specified to round up or down, we will return the exact float result of the division.

3.5
