The function `count_bidirectional` is designed to count the number of bidirectional pairs in a list of tuples. A bidirectional pair is defined as a pair of tuples where the first element of one tuple is the second element of the other tuple and vice versa.

The variable `test_list` is initialized with the list of tuples `[(5, 6), (1, 2), (6, 5), (9, 1), (6, 5), (2, 1)]`.

The variable `res` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of bidirectional pairs.

The code then enters a nested loop where `idx` iterates over the indices of `test_list` from 0 to the length of `test_list` minus 1, and `iidx` iterates from `idx + 1` to the length of `test_list`.

For each pair of indices `(idx, iidx)`, the code checks if the first element of the tuple at `iidx` is equal to the second element of the tuple at `idx` and if the second element of the tuple at `iidx` is equal to the first element of the tuple at `idx`.

If both conditions are met, it means we have found a bidirectional pair, and `res` is incremented by 1.

The pairs that meet the condition are:
- (5, 6) and (6, 5) - found at indices 0 and 2
- (5, 6) and (6, 5) - found at indices 0 and 4
- (1, 2) and (2, 1) - found at indices 1 and 5
- (6, 5) and (5, 6) - found at indices 2 and 0 (same as the first pair, but in reverse order)
- (6, 5) and (5, 6) - found at indices 2 and 4 (same as the second pair, but with the second occurrence of (6, 5))
- (6, 5) and (5, 6) - found at indices 4 and 0 (same as the first pair, but with the second occurrence of (6, 5))
- (6, 5) and (5, 6) - found at indices 4 and 2 (same as the second pair, but in reverse order)

However, since the pairs (5, 6) and (6, 5) are the same bidirectional pair and are counted twice (once for each order), we only count them as unique pairs. Therefore, we have 2 unique bidirectional pairs: (5, 6) & (6, 5), and (1, 2) & (2, 1).

After the loops finish, the function returns the final value of `res`, which is 2.
