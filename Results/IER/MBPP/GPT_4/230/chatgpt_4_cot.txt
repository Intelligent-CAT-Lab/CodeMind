<<<Analysis>>>
The function `replace_blank` takes two arguments: a string `str1` and a character `char`.
The string `str1` is "hello people", and the character `char` is '@'.
The function uses the `replace` method of the string object to replace all spaces (' ') in `str1` with the character `char`.
In the given string "hello people", there is one space between "hello" and "people".
The `replace` method will substitute this space with the '@' character.
The resulting string will be "hello@people".
The function then returns this new string.
<<<Output>>>
"hello@people"
