<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_Of_Subarray_Prod` is designed to calculate the sum of the products of all subarrays of the given array `arr`.

The input array is `[1, 2, 3]`.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the final answer.
The variable `res` is initialized to 0, which will be used to store intermediate results.
The variable `i` is initialized to the length of the array minus 1, which is 2 in this case.

The code enters a while loop that iterates from the end of the array to the beginning.

1. In the first iteration, `i` is 2, so `arr[i]` is 3.
   `incr` is calculated as `arr[i] * (1 + res)`, which is `3 * (1 + 0) = 3`.
   `ans` is updated to `ans + incr`, which is `0 + 3 = 3`.
   `res` is updated to `incr`, which is `3`.
   `i` is decremented to 1.

2. In the second iteration, `i` is 1, so `arr[i]` is 2.
   `incr` is calculated as `arr[i] * (1 + res)`, which is `2 * (1 + 3) = 8`.
   `ans` is updated to `ans + incr`, which is `3 + 8 = 11`.
   `res` is updated to `incr`, which is `8`.
   `i` is decremented to 0.

3. In the third iteration, `i` is 0, so `arr[i]` is 1.
   `incr` is calculated as `arr[i] * (1 + res)`, which is `1 * (1 + 8) = 9`.
   `ans` is updated to `ans + incr`, which is `11 + 9 = 20`.
   `res` is updated to `incr`, which is `9`.
   `i` is decremented to -1.

The loop ends because `i` is now less than 0.

The function returns the value of `ans`, which is 20.
