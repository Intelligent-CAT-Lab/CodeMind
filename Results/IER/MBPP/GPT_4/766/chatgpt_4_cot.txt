<<<Analysis>>>
The function `pair_wise` takes a list `l1` as an argument.
The variable `temp` is initialized as an empty list, which will be used to store the pairs of elements.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of `l1` minus 2 (because the range is from 0 to `len(l1) - 1` and the loop stops one before the end).
For each iteration, the code takes the current element `l1[i]` and the next element `l1[i + 1]` and creates a tuple `x` with these two elements.
This tuple is appended to the `temp` list.
The loop will create pairs of elements as follows: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5).
After the loop finishes, the function returns the `temp` list containing all the pairs.
<<<Output>>>
[(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)]
