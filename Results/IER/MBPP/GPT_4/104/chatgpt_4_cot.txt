<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_sublists` takes a single argument `input_list`, which is a tuple of lists. Each sublist contains strings.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `input_list`. For each sublist `x`, it applies the `sorted` function. The `sorted` function is called with a key function that sorts the elements of the sublist based on the first character of each string (`lambda x:x[0]`).

The input is a tuple with three sublists: ["green", "orange"], ["black", "white"], and ["white", "black", "orange"].

The sorting will be performed as follows:
1. ["green", "orange"] will be sorted to ["green", "orange"] because 'g' comes before 'o' in the alphabet.
2. ["black", "white"] will be sorted to ["black", "white"] because 'b' comes before 'w'.
3. ["white", "black", "orange"] will be sorted to ["black", "orange", "white"] because 'b' comes before 'o', and 'o' comes before 'w'.

The result will be a list of sorted sublists, which is returned by the function.

<<<Output>>>
[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
