<<<Analysis>>>
The function `replace_char` takes three arguments: `str1`, `ch`, and `newch`, which are initialized to "polygon", 'y', and 'l', respectively.
The function uses the `replace` method of the string object to replace all occurrences of the character `ch` with the character `newch` in `str1`.
In this case, it will replace all occurrences of 'y' with 'l' in the string "polygon".
The string "polygon" contains one 'y', so the function will create a new string "pollgon" where 'y' is replaced with 'l'.
The function then returns this new string.
<<<Output>>>
"pollgon"
