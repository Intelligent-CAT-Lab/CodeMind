<<<Analysis>>>
The function `eulerian_num` is a recursive function that calculates the Eulerian number for given n and m.

1. The function is called with n=3 and m=1.
2. Since m is not greater than or equal to n and n is not 0, and m is not 0, it proceeds to the return statement.
3. It calculates `eulerian_num(3 - 1, 1 - 1)` which is `eulerian_num(2, 0)` and `eulerian_num(3 - 1, 1)` which is `eulerian_num(2, 1)`.

For `eulerian_num(2, 0)`:
4. m is 0, so it returns 1.

For `eulerian_num(2, 1)`:
5. It calculates `eulerian_num(2 - 1, 1 - 1)` which is `eulerian_num(1, 0)` and `eulerian_num(2 - 1, 1)` which is `eulerian_num(1, 1)`.

For `eulerian_num(1, 0)`:
6. m is 0, so it returns 1.

For `eulerian_num(1, 1)`:
7. m is not less than n, so it returns 0.

Now we have the results for the recursive calls:
- `eulerian_num(2, 0)` returned 1
- `eulerian_num(1, 0)` returned 1
- `eulerian_num(1, 1)` returned 0

So `eulerian_num(2, 1)` will return `(2 - 1) * 1 + (1 + 1) * 0` which is `1 * 1 + 2 * 0` which is `1`.

Now we can calculate the original call:
`eulerian_num(3, 1)` will return `(3 - 1) * eulerian_num(2, 0) + (1 + 1) * eulerian_num(2, 1)` which is `2 * 1 + 2 * 1` which is `4`.

Therefore, the return value of `eulerian_num(3, 1)` is 4.
