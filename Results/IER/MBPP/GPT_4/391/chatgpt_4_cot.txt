The function `convert_list_dictionary` takes three lists as input: l1, l2, and l3.
The lists provided as input are:
l1 = ["S001", "S002", "S003", "S004"]
l2 = ["Adina Park", "Leyton Marsh", "Duncan Boyle", "Saim Richards"]
l3 = [85, 98, 89, 92]

The function uses list comprehension to create a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the resulting list has a single key-value pair, where the key is an element from l1 and the value is another dictionary. This inner dictionary has a single key-value pair as well, where the key is from l2 and the value is from l3.

The `zip` function is used to iterate over the three lists simultaneously. For each iteration, it takes one element from each list and forms a tuple (x, y, z), where x is from l1, y is from l2, and z is from l3.

The list comprehension then creates a dictionary for each tuple, with the structure {x: {y: z}}.

The result after processing the input will be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a mapping from an ID (from l1) to a name-score mapping (from l2 and l3).

The expected output will be:
[
    {"S001": {"Adina Park": 85}},
    {"S002": {"Leyton Marsh": 98}},
    {"S003": {"Duncan Boyle": 89}},
    {"S004": {"Saim Richards": 92}}
]
