<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `number` is initialized to 153.
The variable `sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits in `number`.
The variable `times` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of digits in `number`.
The variable `temp` is set to the value of `number` (153) and is used to calculate the number of digits in `number`.

The first while loop calculates the number of digits in `number` (153):
- In the first iteration, `temp` is 153, so `times` becomes 1 and `temp` becomes 15.
- In the second iteration, `temp` is 15, so `times` becomes 2 and `temp` becomes 1.
- In the third iteration, `temp` is 1, so `times` becomes 3 and `temp` becomes 0.
- The loop ends because `temp` is now 0.

Now `times` is 3, which is the number of digits in `number`.

The second while loop calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of `times` (3):
- `temp` is reset to `number` (153).
- In the first iteration, `reminder` is 3 (153 % 10), so `sum` becomes 3^3 (27) and `temp` becomes 15 (153 // 10).
- In the second iteration, `reminder` is 5 (15 % 10), so `sum` becomes 27 + 5^3 (125 + 27 = 152) and `temp` becomes 1 (15 // 10).
- In the third iteration, `reminder` is 1 (1 % 10), so `sum` becomes 152 + 1^3 (152 + 1 = 153) and `temp` becomes 0 (1 // 10).
- The loop ends because `temp` is now 0.

Now `sum` is 153, which is equal to the original `number`.

Since `number` (153) is equal to `sum` (153), the function returns `True`, indicating that 153 is an Armstrong number.
