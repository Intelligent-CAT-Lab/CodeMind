<<<Analysis>>>
The function `left_insertion` takes two arguments: a list `a` and a value `x`.
The list `a` is `[1,2,4,5]`, and the value `x` is `6`.
The function uses the `bisect_left` method from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `x` in the sorted list `a` to maintain the sorted order.
The `bisect_left` method returns the index where `x` should be inserted in the list `a`.
Since `6` is greater than all elements in the list, `bisect_left` will return the index where `6` would be placed if it were to be inserted, which is at the end of the list.
The length of the list `a` is 4, so the insertion index for `6` is `4`.
Therefore, the function will return `4`.
