<<<Analysis>>>
The function `jacobsthal_num` is designed to calculate the nth Jacobsthal number. The Jacobsthal sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
J(n) = J(n-1) + 2*J(n-2) with initial terms J(0) = 0 and J(1) = 1.

The variable `n` is initialized to 5.
An array `dp` of size `n + 1` is created to store the Jacobsthal numbers, initialized with zeros.
The base cases are set: dp[0] = 0 and dp[1] = 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive), meaning it will consider the range from 2 to 5.
For each index `i` in this range, it calculates the Jacobsthal number using the recurrence relation and stores it in `dp[i]`.
The calculations are as follows:
- dp[2] = dp[1] + 2 * dp[0] = 1 + 2 * 0 = 1
- dp[3] = dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] = 1 + 2 * 1 = 3
- dp[4] = dp[3] + 2 * dp[2] = 3 + 2 * 1 = 5
- dp[5] = dp[4] + 2 * dp[3] = 5 + 2 * 3 = 11

After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of `dp[n]`, which is `dp[5]` in this case.
