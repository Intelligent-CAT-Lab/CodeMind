<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_no_of_ways` is designed to calculate the number of ways to paint a fence with `n` posts using `k` different colors, such that no more than two adjacent fence posts have the same color.

The variable `n` is initialized to 2, and `k` is initialized to 4.
A list `dp` is created with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. This list will hold the number of ways to paint the fence for each number of posts.
The variable `total` is initialized to `k`, but it is not used in the function.
The variable `mod` is set to 1000000007, which is a large prime number used for modulo operations to avoid integer overflow.
`dp[1]` is set to `k`, which means there are `k` ways to paint a fence with 1 post.
`dp[2]` is set to `k * k`, which means there are `k * k` ways to paint a fence with 2 posts without any restrictions.
Since `n` is 2, the loop does not execute because the range starts from 3 and goes up to `n` (inclusive).
The function returns `dp[n]`, which is `dp[2]` in this case.
Since `dp[2]` was set to `k * k`, and `k` is 4, the result is `4 * 4`, which is 16.

16
