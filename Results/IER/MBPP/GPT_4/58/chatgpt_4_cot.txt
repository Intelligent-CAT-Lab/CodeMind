<<<Analysis>>>
The function opposite_Signs takes two arguments, x and y, which are initialized to 1 and -2, respectively.
The function returns the result of the expression ((x ^ y) < 0).
The ^ operator is the bitwise XOR operator. It compares each bit of x to the corresponding bit of y and returns a new integer where each bit is 1 if the bits in x and y are different, and 0 if they are the same.
The binary representation of 1 is 0001, and the binary representation of -2 is a bit more complex due to it being negative and the way negative numbers are stored in binary (two's complement representation). However, the most significant bit (the leftmost bit) in a negative number is always 1, indicating that the number is negative.
When we perform the XOR operation on 1 and -2, the most significant bit of the result will be 1 because the most significant bits of 1 and -2 are different (0 in 1 and 1 in -2). This means the result of the XOR operation will be a negative number.
The expression ((x ^ y) < 0) checks if the result of the XOR operation is negative. Since we've established that the result will be negative, the expression will evaluate to True.

True
