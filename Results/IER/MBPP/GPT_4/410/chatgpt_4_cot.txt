<<<Analysis>>>
The function `min_val` is defined to take a single argument `listval`.
The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in `listval`.
The generator expression includes a condition `isinstance(i, int)` which filters out all elements that are not integers.
The `min` function is then used to find the smallest integer in the filtered list.
The input list is `['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']`.
The generator expression filters out 'Python' and 'version' because they are not integers.
The remaining integers are 3, 2, 4, and 5.
The `min` function then finds the smallest of these integers, which is 2.
The function returns this minimum value.
