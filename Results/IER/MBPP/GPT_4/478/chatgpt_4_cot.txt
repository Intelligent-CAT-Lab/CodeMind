<<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_lowercase` is defined with one parameter `str1`.
The function uses the `re.sub` method from the `re` (regular expression) module to substitute all lowercase letters (denoted by `[a-z]`) in the input string `str1` with an empty string (''), effectively removing them.
The input string "PYTHon" is passed to the function.
The `re.sub` method will find all lowercase letters in "PYTHon", which are "o" and "n".
It will then replace "o" and "n" with an empty string, leaving the remaining characters unchanged.
The resulting string, which consists of the remaining characters, will be "PYTH".
The function will return this resulting string.
<<<Output>>>
PYTH
