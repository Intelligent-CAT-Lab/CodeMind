<<<Analysis>>>
The function `rear_extract` takes a list of tuples as an argument, which in this case is `[(1, 'Rash', 21), (2, 'Varsha', 20), (3, 'Kil', 19)]`.
The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list `res` that contains the last element of each tuple in the input list.
The list comprehension iterates over each tuple in `test_list` and extracts the last element using `lis[-1]`.
For the given input, the last elements of the tuples are 21, 20, and 19, respectively.
The resulting list `res` will therefore be `[21, 20, 19]`.
The function returns this list.
<<<Output>>>
[21, 20, 19]
