<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_aggregate` takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains a student's name and their marks.
A defaultdict of type int is created to store the aggregate marks for each student.
The function iterates over the list of tuples, adding the marks to the corresponding student's total in the defaultdict.
The students and their total marks are as follows:
- 'Juan Whelan' has a total of 90 + 122 = 212 marks.
- 'Sabah Colley' has a total of 88 + 84 = 172 marks.
- 'Peter Nichols' has a total of 7 marks.
The function then returns the tuple with the maximum value of marks using the `max` function with a key that specifies to look at the second item of the tuple (the marks).
The tuple with the maximum marks is ('Juan Whelan', 212).
<<<Output>>>
('Juan Whelan', 212)
