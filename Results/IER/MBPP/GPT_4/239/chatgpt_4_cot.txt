<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n)` is designed to calculate the total number of sequences of length `n` from numbers up to `m` where the next number in the sequence is less than or equal to half of the current number.

The variables `m` and `n` are initialized to 10 and 4, respectively.

A two-dimensional list `T` is created with dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)` and initialized with zeros. This list will be used to store intermediate results, with `T[i][j]` representing the number of sequences of length `j` from numbers up to `i`.

The code then enters a nested loop to fill the table `T`. The outer loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `m` (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n` (inclusive).

For each cell `T[i][j]`, the following conditions are checked:
- If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0, `T[i][j]` is set to 0 because there are no sequences of length 0, and there are no sequences from 0 numbers.
- If `i` is less than `j`, `T[i][j]` is set to 0 because you cannot have a sequence of length `j` from less than `j` numbers.
- If `j` is 1, `T[i][j]` is set to `i` because there are `i` sequences of length 1 from numbers up to `i`.
- Otherwise, `T[i][j]` is calculated as the sum of `T[i-1][j]` and `T[i//2][j-1]`. This represents the number of sequences ending with a number less than `i` plus the number of sequences of length `j-1` from numbers up to `i//2` with `i` appended at the end.

After filling the table, the function returns the value of `T[m][n]`, which is the total number of sequences of length `n` from numbers up to `m`.

Let's calculate the value of `T[10][4]` step by step:
- Initialize `T` with zeros.
- Fill the table according to the rules.
- The final value of `T[10][4]` will be the sum of `T[9][4]` (sequences of length 4 from numbers up to 9) and `T[5][3]` (sequences of length 3 from numbers up to 5 with 10 appended at the end).

The calculation of `T[10][4]` depends on the previous values in the table, which are calculated using the same rules. The final result is the value at `T[10][4]` after the table is completely filled.
