<<<Analysis>>>
The function `trim_tuple` takes a list of tuples `test_list` and an integer `K` as its arguments.
The variable `res` is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the trimmed tuples.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each tuple `ele` in `test_list`.
For each tuple `ele`, it calculates the length `N`.
It then uses slicing to create a new tuple from the elements of `ele`, starting from index `K` up to `N - K` (exclusive on the right end).
This effectively trims `K` elements from both the start and the end of the tuple.
The new trimmed tuple is appended to the `res` list.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the string representation of the `res` list.
For the input `[(5, 3, 2, 1, 4), (3, 4, 9, 2, 1), (9, 1, 2, 3, 5), (4, 8, 2, 1, 7)]` and `K = 2`, the function will process as follows:
- The first tuple `(5, 3, 2, 1, 4)` will be trimmed to `(2,)`.
- The second tuple `(3, 4, 9, 2, 1)` will be trimmed to `(9,)`.
- The third tuple `(9, 1, 2, 3, 5)` will be trimmed to `(2,)`.
- The fourth tuple `(4, 8, 2, 1, 7)` will be trimmed to `(2,)`.
The final `res` list will be `[(2,), (9,), (2,), (2,)]`.
The function returns the string representation of this list.

'[(2,), (9,), (2,), (2,)]'
