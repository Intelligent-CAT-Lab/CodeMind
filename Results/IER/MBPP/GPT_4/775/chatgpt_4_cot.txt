<<<Analysis>>>
The function `odd_position` takes a list `nums` as input.
The function uses a generator expression within the `all` function to check a condition for each element in the list.
The condition being checked is whether the element at index `i` is odd if `i` is odd, and even if `i` is even.
The list `nums` is `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]`.
The condition is checked for each element as follows:
- nums[0] = 2, index 0 is even, and 2 is even, so the condition is True.
- nums[1] = 1, index 1 is odd, and 1 is odd, so the condition is True.
- nums[2] = 4, index 2 is even, and 4 is even, so the condition is True.
- nums[3] = 3, index 3 is odd, and 3 is odd, so the condition is True.
- nums[4] = 6, index 4 is even, and 6 is even, so the condition is True.
- nums[5] = 7, index 5 is odd, and 7 is odd, so the condition is True.
- nums[6] = 6, index 6 is even, but 6 is even, so the condition is True.
- nums[7] = 3, index 7 is odd, and 3 is odd, so the condition is True.
Since all conditions are True, the `all` function will return True.
