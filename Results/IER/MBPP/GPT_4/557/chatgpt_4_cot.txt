<<<Analysis>>>
The function `toggle_string` takes a single argument, which is a string. The input string "Python" is passed to the function.
Inside the function, the `swapcase()` method is called on the input string. This method returns a new string with all uppercase letters converted to lowercase and vice versa.
For the input "Python", the `swapcase()` method will convert 'P' to 'p', 'y' to 'Y', 't' to 'T', 'h' to 'H', 'o' to 'O', and 'n' to 'N'.
The resulting string after applying `swapcase()` to "Python" is "pYTHON".
The function then returns this new string.
<<<Output>>>
pYTHON
