<<<Analysis>>>
The function `substract_elements` takes two tuples as arguments, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
The tuples provided as input are `(10, 4, 5)` and `(2, 5, 18)`.
The function uses the `map` function along with a lambda function to subtract the elements of `test_tup2` from `test_tup1` element-wise.
The lambda function takes two arguments `i` and `j`, which correspond to elements from `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` respectively.
The subtraction is performed as follows:
- 10 (from `test_tup1`) - 2 (from `test_tup2`) = 8
- 4 (from `test_tup1`) - 5 (from `test_tup2`) = -1
- 5 (from `test_tup1`) - 18 (from `test_tup2`) = -13
The result of the map operation is a map object which is then converted to a tuple.
The resulting tuple, which is the difference between the two tuples, is returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
(8, -1, -13)
