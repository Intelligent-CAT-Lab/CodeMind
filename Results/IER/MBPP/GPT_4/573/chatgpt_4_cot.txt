The function `unique_product` takes a list called `list_data` as input.
The input list is `[10, 20, 30, 40, 20, 50, 60, 40]`.
The first line inside the function converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and then converts it back to a list, resulting in `temp = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]`.
The variable `p` is initialized to 1, which will be used to calculate the product of the unique elements.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in `temp`.
For each element `i` in `temp`, it multiplies `p` by `i`.
The loop processes the elements in the following order:
- `p *= 10` results in `p = 10`
- `p *= 20` results in `p = 200`
- `p *= 30` results in `p = 6000`
- `p *= 40` results in `p = 240000`
- `p *= 50` results in `p = 12000000`
- `p *= 60` results in `p = 720000000`
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `p`, which is 720000000.
<<<Output>>>
720000000
