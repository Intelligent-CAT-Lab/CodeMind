<<<Analysis>>>
The function `power` is a recursive function that calculates `a` raised to the power of `b`.

1. The initial call is `power(3,4)`.
2. Since `b` is not 0, `a` is not 0, and `b` is not 1, it goes to the else clause and makes a recursive call to `power(3,3)`.
3. In the recursive call `power(3,3)`, again `b` is not 0, `a` is not 0, and `b` is not 1, so it makes another recursive call to `power(3,2)`.
4. In the recursive call `power(3,2)`, the same logic applies, and it makes a recursive call to `power(3,1)`.
5. In the recursive call `power(3,1)`, since `b` is 1, it returns `a`, which is 3.
6. Now, going back up the recursion, `power(3,2)` returns `3 * 3`, which is 9.
7. Then, `power(3,3)` returns `3 * 9`, which is 27.
8. Finally, `power(3,4)` returns `3 * 27`, which is 81.

The final result of `power(3,4)` is 81.
