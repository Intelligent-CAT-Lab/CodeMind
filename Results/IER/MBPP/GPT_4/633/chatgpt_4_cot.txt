The function `pair_xor_Sum` takes an array `arr` and an integer `n` as its parameters. The array `arr` is initialized to `[5,9,7,6]`, and `n` is initialized to `4`, indicating the number of elements in the array.

The variable `ans` is initialized to `0`. This variable will accumulate the sum of the XOR of all unique pairs in the array.

The code then enters a nested loop:
- The outer loop runs from index `0` to `n-1` (0 to 3 in this case).
- The inner loop runs from index `i+1` to `n-1` (so it starts from the element right after the current element of the outer loop to the end of the array).

For each pair of elements `(arr[i], arr[j])`, the code calculates their XOR using the `^` operator and adds the result to `ans`.

The pairs and their XOR values are as follows:
- Pair (5, 9): XOR = 12
- Pair (5, 7): XOR = 2
- Pair (5, 6): XOR = 3
- Pair (9, 7): XOR = 14
- Pair (9, 6): XOR = 15
- Pair (7, 6): XOR = 1

The sum of these XOR values is `12 + 2 + 3 + 14 + 15 + 1 = 47`.

After the loops finish, the function returns the final value of `ans`, which is `47`.
