The function `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos` takes two integers, `a` and `b`, and determines if they differ at exactly one bit position.

1. The function `is_Power_Of_Two` checks if a number `x` is a power of two. It returns `True` if `x` is not zero and `x` bitwise AND `x-1` is zero. This works because a power of two in binary has a single '1' followed by '0's, and subtracting 1 from it flips all the bits up to and including the first '1'. The bitwise AND of these two numbers will be zero if the original number was a power of two.

2. Inside `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos`, the expression `a ^ b` computes the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`. This operation will result in a binary number with '1's in positions where `a` and `b` differ, and '0's where they are the same.

3. For the input `a = 13` and `b = 9`, the binary representations are `1101` and `1001`, respectively. The XOR of these numbers is `0100`, which is the binary representation of the number 4.

4. The number 4 is indeed a power of two (2^2), so the function `is_Power_Of_Two` should return `True`.

5. Therefore, the return value of `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9)` should be `True`, indicating that 13 and 9 differ at exactly one bit position.
