<<<Analysis>>>
The function `text_starta_endb` is defined with one parameter `text`.
The variable `patterns` is initialized to the regular expression 'a.*?b$'.
The regular expression 'a.*?b$' is designed to find a substring that starts with 'a', followed by any characters (as few as possible due to the non-greedy `.*?`), and ends with 'b' at the end of the string (denoted by `$`).
The `re.search` function is used to search for the pattern in the given `text`, which is "aabbbb".
The pattern matches the substring "aabbbb" because it starts with 'a', ends with 'b', and has any characters in between (in this case, 'abbb').
Since the pattern is found, `re.search` returns a match object.
<<<Output>>>
<re.Match object; span=(0, 6), match='aabbbb'>
