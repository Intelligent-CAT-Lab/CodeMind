<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_combinations` takes a list of tuples as an argument. The list provided in the question is `[(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)]`.

The function uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of the tuples in the list taken 2 at a time.

The list comprehension iterates over these combinations, and for each combination, it adds the corresponding elements of the tuples together to form a new tuple. The first element of the new tuple is the sum of the first elements of the two tuples in the combination, and the second element is the sum of the second elements.

The combinations of the tuples are as follows:
- Combining (2, 4) and (6, 7) gives (8, 11)
- Combining (2, 4) and (5, 1) gives (7, 5)
- Combining (2, 4) and (6, 10) gives (8, 14)
- Combining (6, 7) and (5, 1) gives (11, 8)
- Combining (6, 7) and (6, 10) gives (12, 17)
- Combining (5, 1) and (6, 10) gives (11, 11)

The result is a list of these new tuples, which is returned by the function.

[(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]
