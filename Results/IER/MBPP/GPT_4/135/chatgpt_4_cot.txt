<<<Analysis>>>
The function `hexagonal_num` takes a single argument `n`, which is set to 10.
The function calculates the hexagonal number using the formula `n*(2*n - 1)`.
For `n = 10`, the calculation is `10 * (2*10 - 1)`, which simplifies to `10 * (20 - 1)` and then to `10 * 19`.
The result of `10 * 19` is `190`.
Therefore, the function will return the value `190`.
<<<Output>>>
190
