<<<Analysis>>>
The function `all_Characters_Same` takes a string `s` as input.
The variable `n` is initialized to the length of the string `s`, which is 6 for the input "python".
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive), meaning it will consider characters from the second character to the last character of the string.
For each character `s[i]` in this range, the code checks if it is not equal to the first character `s[0]`.
If any character `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]`, the function returns `False`.
In the case of the input "python", the second character 'y' is not equal to the first character 'p', so the function will return `False` without checking the rest of the characters.
<<<Output>>>
False
