<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sequential_search` is called with a list `[11,23,58,31,56,77,43,12,65,19]` and the item `31` to search for.
The variable `pos` is initialized to 0, and `found` is initialized to False.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as `pos` is less than the length of `dlist` and `found` is False.
The loop checks each element of `dlist` to see if it matches the `item` (31).
The loop iterates over the list, and when `pos` is 3, the item at `dlist[3]` is 31, which matches the `item` we are searching for.
At this point, `found` is set to True, and the loop terminates.
The function returns a tuple `(found, pos)`, which in this case is `(True, 3)`, indicating that the item was found at index 3.
<<<Output>>>
(True, 3)
