<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_sublist` takes two lists, `l` and `s`, and checks if `s` is a sublist of `l`.
The variable `sub_set` is initialized to `False`.
The function first checks if `s` is an empty list. If it is, `sub_set` is set to `True`.
Next, the function checks if `s` is the same as `l`. If they are the same, `sub_set` is set to `True`.
Then, the function checks if the length of `s` is greater than the length of `l`. If it is, `sub_set` is set to `False`.
If none of the above conditions are met, the function enters a loop to check if `s` is a contiguous sublist of `l`.
The loop iterates over the elements of `l`. For each element, it checks if it is equal to the first element of `s`.
If an element in `l` matches the first element of `s`, the function enters a while loop to check if the subsequent elements in `l` match the rest of `s`.
The while loop continues as long as the elements match and the index `n` is less than the length of `s`.
If the while loop completes and `n` equals the length of `s`, it means all elements of `s` were found in sequence in `l`, and `sub_set` is set to `True`.
For the input `is_sublist([2,4,3,5,7],[3,7])`, the function will find that `3` from `s` matches with the third element of `l`.
However, the next element in `l` is `5`, which does not match the second element of `s` (`7`), so the while loop will break, and `sub_set` will remain `False`.
Since `s` is not an empty list, not equal to `l`, not longer than `l`, and not found as a contiguous sublist in `l`, the function will return `False`.
