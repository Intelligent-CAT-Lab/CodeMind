<<<Analysis>>>
The function `occurance_substring` takes two arguments: `text` and `pattern`. The `text` is 'python programming, python language', and the `pattern` is 'python'.
The function uses the `re.finditer` method to find all non-overlapping occurrences of the pattern 'python' in the text.
The `for` loop iterates over each match found by `re.finditer`.
For the first match, it captures the start and end indices of the match using `match.start()` and `match.end()`.
The function then returns a tuple containing the substring from the text that matches the pattern (which is 'python'), and the start and end indices of this match (which are 0 and 6, respectively).
Since the `return` statement is inside the loop, the function will return after finding the first occurrence and will not continue to find subsequent occurrences.
Therefore, the function will return the first occurrence of 'python' in the text, which starts at index 0 and ends at index 6.
<<<Output>>>
('python', 0, 6)
