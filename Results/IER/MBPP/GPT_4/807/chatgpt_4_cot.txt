<<<Analysis>>>
The function `first_odd` is designed to return the first odd number from a list of numbers. If there are no odd numbers, it returns -1.
The input list is `[1,3,5]`.
The function uses a generator expression `(el for el in nums if el%2!=0)` to iterate over the elements of the list and select only the odd numbers (where the number modulo 2 is not equal to 0).
The `next` function is used to get the first element from the generator expression. If the generator is empty (no odd numbers), it will return -1.
Since the first element of the list is 1, which is an odd number, the generator will yield 1, and `next` will return it.
Therefore, the function will return 1.
