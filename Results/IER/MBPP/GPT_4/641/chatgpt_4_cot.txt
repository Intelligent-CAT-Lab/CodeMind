<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_nonagonal` takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the value of the formula `n * (7 * n - 5) / 2`. This formula is intended to calculate the nth nonagonal number, but the function is missing a crucial step: it should check whether the result is an integer representing a nonagonal number, not just return the calculated value.

However, as the function is currently implemented, it simply performs the calculation and returns the result as an integer due to the `int()` cast. It does not validate whether the number is actually a nonagonal number.

For the input `n = 10`, the calculation is as follows:
- The formula inside the `int()` function is `10 * (7 * 10 - 5) / 2`.
- This simplifies to `10 * (70 - 5) / 2`.
- Which further simplifies to `10 * 65 / 2`.
- And finally to `650 / 2`.
- The result of the division is `325`.

Therefore, the function will return `325` for the input `10`.
