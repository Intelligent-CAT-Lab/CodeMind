<<<Analysis>>>
The function `empty_dit` is called with a list containing three empty dictionaries: `[{},{},{}]`.
The variable `empty_dit` is initialized with the result of the expression `all(not d for d in list1)`.
The generator expression `(not d for d in list1)` will iterate over each dictionary `d` in `list1` and evaluate `not d`.
Since all dictionaries in `list1` are empty, `not d` will be `True` for each dictionary because an empty dictionary is considered False in a boolean context.
The `all` function will then check if all values in the generator expression are `True`. Since they are, `all` will return `True`.
Therefore, the function `empty_dit` will return `True`.

True
