<<<Analysis>>>
The function `surfacearea_cube` takes a single argument `l`, which represents the length of a side of a cube.
The variable `l` is initialized to 5.
The variable `surfacearea` is calculated by multiplying 6 (the number of faces on a cube) by the square of the length of a side (`l*l`), which is `5*5`.
The calculation is `6 * 5 * 5`, which equals `150`.
The function then returns the value of `surfacearea`.
<<<Output>>>
150
