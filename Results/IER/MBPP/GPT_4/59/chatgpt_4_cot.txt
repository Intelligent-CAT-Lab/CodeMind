<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_octagonal` takes a single argument `n`, which is initialized to 5.
The function calculates the value of the expression `3 * n * n - 2 * n` using the value of `n`.
Substituting the value of `n` with 5, the expression becomes `3 * 5 * 5 - 2 * 5`.
This simplifies to `3 * 25 - 10`, which is `75 - 10`.
The final result of the calculation is `65`.
The function returns this value.
