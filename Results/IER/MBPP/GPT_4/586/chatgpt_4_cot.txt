<<<Analysis>>>
The function `split_Arr` takes two arguments: a list `l` and an integer `n`.
The list `l` is `[12,10,5,6,52,36]` and `n` is `2`.
The function returns a new list that is a concatenation of two sublists:
1. The first sublist is `l[n:]`, which is the part of the list from the index `n` to the end. With `n` being `2`, this sublist is `[5,6,52,36]`.
2. The second sublist is `l[:n]`, which is the part of the list from the beginning up to (but not including) index `n`. With `n` being `2`, this sublist is `[12,10]`.
The function concatenates these two sublists to form the new list `[5,6,52,36,12,10]`.
<<<Output>>>
[5,6,52,36,12,10]
