<<<Analysis>>>
The function `tetrahedral_number` takes a single argument `n`, which is initialized to 5.
The function calculates the tetrahedral number for the given `n` using the formula `(n * (n + 1) * (n + 2)) / 6`.
For `n = 5`, the calculation is as follows:
(5 * (5 + 1) * (5 + 2)) / 6
(5 * 6 * 7) / 6
210 / 6
The result of the calculation is 35.
Therefore, the function will return the value 35.
<<<Output>>>
35
