The function `round_and_sum` takes a list of floating-point numbers as input.
The variable `list1` is initialized with the input list `[22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50]`.
The variable `lenght` is set to the length of `list1`, which is 9 in this case.
The function then maps the `round` function to each element in `list1`, effectively rounding each number to the nearest integer. The resulting list after rounding is `[22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18]`.
This rounded list is then multiplied by `lenght` (which is 9), but this is a mistake in the code. The intention might have been to sum the elements of the rounded list and then multiply the sum by the length, but the code as written will attempt to multiply the list object by an integer, which will result in an error.
However, if we assume the intention was to sum the elements first, the sum of the rounded list would be `22 + 4 - 16 - 9 + 11 - 12 + 14 - 5 + 18 = 27`.
If we then multiply this sum by the length (9), we would get `27 * 9 = 243`.
But since the code will raise an error due to the incorrect multiplication of a list by an integer, there is no valid output. The correct code should have been `round_and_sum = sum(list(map(round, list1))) * lenght`.
