<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_list` is designed to return the length of the input list.
The input provided to the function is a list of lists: `[[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`.
The outer list contains 4 elements, each of which is a list itself.
The function does not consider the contents or lengths of the inner lists; it only counts how many elements are in the outer list.
Therefore, the return value of the function will be 4, as there are 4 elements (lists) in the input list.
<<<Output>>>
