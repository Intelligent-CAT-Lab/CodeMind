<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_range_list` is defined with parameters `list1`, `m`, and `n`.
The variable `sum_range` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of elements in the specified range of the list.
The input list `list1` is `[2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12]`.
The variables `m` and `n` are initialized to 8 and 10, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from `m` to `n` (inclusive), meaning it will consider elements at indices 8, 9, and 10 of the list `list1`.
The elements at these indices are 10, 11, and 8, respectively.
The code adds each of these elements to `sum_range`, resulting in `sum_range = 10 + 11 + 8`.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `sum_range`, which is 29.

29
