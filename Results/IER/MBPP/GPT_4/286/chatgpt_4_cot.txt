The function `max_sub_array_sum_repeated` is designed to find the maximum subarray sum in a repeated array. The input array `a` is `[10, 20, -30, -1]`, `n` is `4` (the length of the array), and `k` is `3` (the number of times the array is repeated).

The variable `max_so_far` is initialized to a very small number (-2147483648) to ensure that any sum encountered will be larger.
The variable `max_ending_here` is initialized to 0 and will be used to keep track of the current subarray sum.

The function enters a loop that will iterate `n*k` times, which is `4*3 = 12` times in this case, effectively simulating the array being repeated 3 times.

The loop does the following:
1. Adds the current element `a[i%n]` to `max_ending_here`. The expression `i%n` ensures that we cycle through the original array elements for each repetition.
2. If `max_so_far` is less than `max_ending_here`, it updates `max_so_far` with the value of `max_ending_here`.
3. If `max_ending_here` becomes negative, it resets it to 0.

Let's simulate the loop:
- First iteration (i=0): max_ending_here = 0 + 10 = 10, max_so_far = 10
- Second iteration (i=1): max_ending_here = 10 + 20 = 30, max_so_far = 30
- Third iteration (i=2): max_ending_here = 30 - 30 = 0, max_so_far = 30
- Fourth iteration (i=3): max_ending_here = 0 - 1 = -1, max_ending_here is reset to 0, max_so_far = 30
- Fifth iteration (i=4): max_ending_here = 0 + 10 = 10, max_so_far = 30
- Sixth iteration (i=5): max_ending_here = 10 + 20 = 30, max_so_far = 30
- Seventh iteration (i=6): max_ending_here = 30 - 30 = 0, max_so_far = 30
- Eighth iteration (i=7): max_ending_here = 0 - 1 = -1, max_ending_here is reset to 0, max_so_far = 30
- Ninth iteration (i=8): max_ending_here = 0 + 10 = 10, max_so_far = 30
- Tenth iteration (i=9): max_ending_here = 10 + 20 = 30, max_so_far = 30
- Eleventh iteration (i=10): max_ending_here = 30 - 30 = 0, max_so_far = 30
- Twelfth iteration (i=11): max_ending_here = 0 - 1 = -1, max_ending_here is reset to 0, max_so_far = 30

After the loop finishes, the function returns `max_so_far`, which is 30.
