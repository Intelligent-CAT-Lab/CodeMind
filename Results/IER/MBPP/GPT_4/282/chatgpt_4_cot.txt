<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sub_list` takes two lists, `nums1` and `nums2`, as arguments.
The `map` function is used with a lambda function that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns the result of `x - y`.
The `map` function applies the lambda to each pair of elements from `nums1` and `nums2` in order.
The pairs of elements are (1, 4), (2, 5), and (3, 6).
The lambda function calculates the differences: -3, -3, and -3, respectively.
The `map` object is then converted to a list with the `list` function.
The final result is a list of the differences: `[-3, -3, -3]`.
<<<Output>>>
[-3, -3, -3]
