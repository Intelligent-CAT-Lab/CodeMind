<<<Analysis>>>
The function `all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range` is designed to check if all bits in a given range (from l to r) of a binary number n are set to 1.

The variable n is initialized to 4, l to 1, and r to 2.

The binary representation of n (4) is 100.

The code creates a mask to isolate the bits in the range from l to r:
- It first creates a mask with r bits set to 1: `(1 << r) - 1` which is `(1 << 2) - 1` or `4 - 1` which is `3` (binary 011).
- Then it creates a mask with (l - 1) bits set to 1: `(1 << (l - 1)) - 1` which is `(1 << (1 - 1)) - 1` or `1 - 1` which is `0` (binary 000).
- It then XORs these two masks to get the final mask: `3 ^ 0` which is `3` (binary 011).

The code then performs an AND operation between n and the mask: `4 & 3` which is `0` (binary 000).

The result of the AND operation is compared to 0. If it is equal to 0, it means that not all bits in the given range are set to 1, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it would return `False`.

In this case, since the result of the AND operation is 0, the function will return `True`.
