<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_integer` is designed to count the number of integers in a given list `list1`.
The input list is `[1,2,'abc',1.2]`.
The variable `ctr` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the integers.
The code enters a loop that iterates over each element in the list.
For each element `i` in the list, the code checks if `i` is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(i, int)`.
The first element `1` is an integer, so `ctr` is incremented by 1.
The second element `2` is also an integer, so `ctr` is incremented again, now `ctr` is 2.
The third element `'abc'` is a string, not an integer, so `ctr` remains 2.
The fourth element `1.2` is a float, not an integer, so `ctr` remains 2.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `ctr`, which is 2.
