<<<Analysis>>>
The function `second_smallest` is designed to return the second smallest unique number from a list of numbers.
The input list is `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`.
First, the function creates a set from the input list to remove duplicates, resulting in `{-8, -2, 0, 1, 2}`.
This set is then converted back into a list to get `[-8, -2, 0, 1, 2]`.
The list is sorted, resulting in `[-8, -2, 0, 1, 2]` which is already sorted in ascending order.
The function checks if the length of the unique numbers list is less than 2. In this case, it is not, as there are 5 unique numbers.
Since there are at least two unique numbers, the function returns the second element in the sorted list, which is `-2`.
<<<Output>>>
-2
