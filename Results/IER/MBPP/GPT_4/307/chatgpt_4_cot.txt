<<<Analysis>>>
The function `colon_tuplex` takes three arguments: a tuple `tuplex`, an integer `m`, and an integer `n`.
The tuple `tuplex` is initialized to ("HELLO", 5, [], True).
The integer `m` is initialized to 2, and `n` is initialized to 50.
The function uses `deepcopy` to create a deep copy of the tuple `tuplex` and assigns it to `tuplex_colon`. This is necessary because tuples are immutable, but we want to modify one of the items inside the tuple, which is a list.
The code then accesses the element at index `m` of `tuplex_colon`, which is the empty list `[]` at index 2.
It appends the integer `n` (which is 50) to this list.
The modified tuple `tuplex_colon` is then returned, which now has the list at index 2 containing the value 50.
The expected output is the tuple ("HELLO", 5, [50], True) after the modification.
<<<Output>>>
("HELLO", 5, [50], True)
