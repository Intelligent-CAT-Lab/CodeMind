<<<Analysis>>>
The function `odd_values_string` is designed to return a new string consisting of the characters at odd positions in the input string. Here, the input string is 'abcdef'.
The variable `result` is initialized to an empty string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the input string, which are 0 to 5 for 'abcdef'.
For each index `i`, the code checks if `i` is even (i % 2 == 0). If it is, it appends the character at that index to `result`.
The characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) of 'abcdef' are 'a', 'c', and 'e', respectively.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `result`, which is 'ace'.
<<<Output>>>
ace
