The function `find_First_Missing` is designed to find the smallest missing number in a sorted array where the elements are starting from 0.

The input array is `[0,1,2,3]`. The function is called with `start=0` and `end=None`. Since `end` is `None`, it is set to the length of the array minus 1, which is 3.

The function then checks if `start` is greater than `end`, which is not the case here (0 is not greater than 3), so it does not return at this point.

Next, the function checks if the value at the index `start` is not equal to `start`. Since the value at index 0 is 0, this condition is not met.

The function then calculates the middle index `mid` as the integer division of `(start + end) / 2`, which is `(0 + 3) / 2`, resulting in 1.5, which is then converted to 1 by the `int` function.

It checks if the value at the middle index is equal to `mid`. Since the value at index 1 is 1, this condition is met.

Because the value at `mid` is equal to `mid`, the function calls itself recursively with the new `start` as `mid + 1`, which is 2, and the same `end`, which is 3.

In the recursive call, `start` is 2 and `end` is 3. The function checks if `start` is greater than `end`, which is not the case.

It then checks if the value at index `start` is not equal to `start`. Since the value at index 2 is 2, this condition is not met.

The function calculates the new `mid` as `(2 + 3) / 2`, which is 2.5, and then converted to 2 by the `int` function.

It checks if the value at the middle index is equal to `mid`. Since the value at index 2 is 2, this condition is met.

The function calls itself recursively again with the new `start` as `mid + 1`, which is 3, and the same `end`, which is 3.

In the next recursive call, `start` is 3 and `end` is 3. The function checks if `start` is greater than `end`, which is not the case.

It then checks if the value at index `start` is not equal to `start`. Since the value at index 3 is 3, this condition is not met.

The function calculates the new `mid` as `(3 + 3) / 2`, which is 3.

It checks if the value at the middle index is equal to `mid`. Since the value at index 3 is 3, this condition is met.

The function calls itself recursively again with the new `start` as `mid + 1`, which is 4, and the same `end`, which is 3.

In the final recursive call, `start` is 4 and `end` is 3. The function checks if `start` is greater than `end`, which is now the case.

Since `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns `end + 1`, which is 3 + 1, resulting in 4.

Therefore, the smallest missing number in the array `[0,1,2,3]` is 4.
