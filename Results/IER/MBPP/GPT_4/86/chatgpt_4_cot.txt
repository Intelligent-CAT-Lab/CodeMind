<<<Analysis>>>
The function `centered_hexagonal_number` takes a single argument `n`, which is initialized to 10.
The function calculates the centered hexagonal number using the formula `3 * n * (n - 1) + 1`.
The calculation proceeds as follows:
- First, `n - 1` is calculated, which is `10 - 1 = 9`.
- Then, `n * (n - 1)` is calculated, which is `10 * 9 = 90`.
- Next, `3 * n * (n - 1)` is calculated, which is `3 * 90 = 270`.
- Finally, `1` is added to the result, which is `270 + 1 = 271`.
The function returns the result of the calculation, which is `271`.
<<<Output>>>
271
