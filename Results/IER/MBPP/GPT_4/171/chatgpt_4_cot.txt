<<<Analysis>>>
The function `perimeter_pentagon` takes a single argument `a`, which represents the length of a side of a pentagon.
The variable `a` is initialized to 5.
The function calculates the perimeter of the pentagon by multiplying the length of one side by the number of sides, which is 5.
The calculation is straightforward: perimeter = 5 * a = 5 * 5 = 25.
The function then returns the calculated perimeter.
<<<Output>>>
25
