<<<Analysis>>>
The function `tup_string` takes a single argument `tup1`, which is expected to be a tuple of characters.
The tuple `tup1` is initialized to ('e', 'x', 'e', 'r', 'c', 'i', 's', 'e', 's').
Inside the function, the `str` variable is created by joining all elements of the tuple `tup1` into a single string. The `join` method concatenates the elements of the tuple without any separator.
The resulting string is 'exercises', which is then returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
'exercises'
