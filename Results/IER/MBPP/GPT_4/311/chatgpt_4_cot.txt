The variable n is initialized to 10.
The function first checks if n & (n + 1) is 0, which would mean that all bits to the right of the leftmost unset bit are set. Since 10 & (10 + 1) is not 0, the function proceeds to the next step.
The variables pos, temp, and count are initialized to 0, n (which is 10), and 0, respectively.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as temp is not 0.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the rightmost bit of temp is not set (temp & 1 is 0). If it is not set, pos is updated to the current value of count.
The count is incremented by 1, and temp is right-shifted by 1 bit.
This process continues until all bits of temp have been checked.
For the number 10, which is 1010 in binary, the leftmost unset bit is at position 3 (0-indexed from the right).
After the loop, the code returns n with the leftmost unset bit set to 1. This is done by OR-ing n with 1 left-shifted by pos positions.
For n = 10 (1010 in binary), setting the leftmost unset bit results in 14 (1110 in binary).
