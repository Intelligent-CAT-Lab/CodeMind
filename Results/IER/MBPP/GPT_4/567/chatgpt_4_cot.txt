<<<Analysis>>>
The function `issort_list` takes a single argument `list1`, which is a list of integers.
The function uses the `all` function in combination with a generator expression to check if every element in `list1` is less than or equal to the next element.
The generator expression iterates over the indices of `list1` from 0 to the second-to-last index (since it compares each element with the next one, it doesn't need to go to the last index).
For each index `i`, the expression `list1[i] <= list1[i+1]` checks if the current element is less than or equal to the next element.
If all comparisons are True, the `all` function will return True; otherwise, it will return False.
In the case of `issort_list([1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,17])`, the list is sorted in ascending order, so each element is indeed less than or equal to the next one.
Therefore, the result will be True.
