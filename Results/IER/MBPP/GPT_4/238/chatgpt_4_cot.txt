<<<Analysis>>>
The function `number_of_substrings` takes a single string argument and calculates the number of possible substrings (including the original string and empty string) that can be formed from it. The formula used is `str_len * (str_len + 1) / 2`, where `str_len` is the length of the string.

For the input "abc":
1. The length of the string `str_len` is calculated to be 3.
2. The formula is applied: `3 * (3 + 1) / 2` which simplifies to `3 * 4 / 2`.
3. The result of the calculation is `12 / 2`.
4. The final result is `6`.

Therefore, the function will return 6, indicating that there are 6 possible substrings that can be formed from the string "abc".
<<<Output>>>
6
