<<<Analysis>>>
The function `move_zero` takes a list of numbers as input and moves all the zeros to the end of the list while maintaining the order of the non-zero elements.

1. The input list is `[1,0,2,0,3,4]`.
2. The list comprehension `[0 for i in range(num_list.count(0))]` creates a list of zeros with the same number of zeros as in the input list. In this case, there are two zeros, so it creates `[0, 0]`.
3. The list comprehension `[i for i in num_list if i != 0]` creates a list of all non-zero elements from the input list. For the given input, this results in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
4. The two lists are concatenated using the `+` operator, resulting in the non-zero elements followed by the zeros: `[1, 2, 3, 4] + [0, 0]`.
5. The final returned list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0]`.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0]
