The function `comb_sort` is an implementation of the comb sort algorithm, which is an improvement on bubble sort. The list `nums` is initialized to `[5, 15, 37, 25, 79]`.

1. The `shrink_fact` is set to 1.3, which is used to reduce the gap between compared elements.
2. The `gaps` variable is initialized to the length of `nums`, which is 5.
3. The `swapped` variable is a boolean flag used to determine if a swap has occurred in the inner loop.
4. The outer loop continues until `gaps` is reduced to 1 and no swaps have occurred in the previous inner loop iteration.

The first iteration of the outer loop:
- `gaps` is set to `int(5 / 1.3)` which is `3`.
- The inner loop compares and swaps elements that are 3 positions apart.
- The pairs compared are (5, 25), (15, 79). No swaps occur, so `swapped` remains `False`.

The second iteration of the outer loop:
- `gaps` is now `int(3 / 1.3)` which is `2`.
- The inner loop compares and swaps elements that are 2 positions apart.
- The pairs compared are (5, 37), (15, 25), (37, 79). The pair (15, 25) is out of order, so they are swapped. Now the list is `[5, 25, 37, 15, 79]`. `swapped` is set to `True`.

The third iteration of the outer loop:
- `gaps` is now `int(2 / 1.3)` which is `1`.
- The inner loop compares and swaps adjacent elements.
- The pairs compared are (5, 25), (25, 37), (37, 15), (15, 79). The pair (37, 15) is out of order, so they are swapped. Now the list is `[5, 25, 15, 37, 79]`. `swapped` is set to `True`.
- The inner loop runs again because `swapped` is `True`. The pairs compared are (5, 25), (25, 15), (15, 37), (37, 79). The pair (25, 15) is out of order, so they are swapped. Now the list is `[5, 15, 25, 37, 79]`. `swapped` is set to `True`.

Since the last pass resulted in a swap, the outer loop will run again, but since `gaps` is already 1, it will not change. The inner loop will run again, but this time no swaps will occur because the list is already sorted.

The sorted list `[5, 15, 25, 37, 79]` is returned.
