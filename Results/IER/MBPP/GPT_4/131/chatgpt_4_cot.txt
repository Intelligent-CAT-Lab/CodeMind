<<<Analysis>>>
The function `reverse_vowels` is designed to take a string `str1` and return a new string where the vowels in `str1` are reversed.

1. The input string "Python" is passed to the function.
2. A new string `vowels` is initialized to store all the vowels from `str1`.
3. The first for loop iterates over each character in "Python" and appends vowels to the `vowels` string. After this loop, `vowels` contains "o".
4. A new string `result_string` is initialized to build the final result.
5. The second for loop iterates over each character in "Python" again.
6. If the character is a vowel (which is only 'o' in "Python"), it appends the last character of `vowels` to `result_string` and removes the last character from `vowels`. Now `vowels` becomes an empty string.
7. If the character is not a vowel, it just appends the character to `result_string`.
8. After the loop, `result_string` is "Pythno", which is the original string "Python" with the vowels reversed (although there is only one vowel in this case).
9. The function returns `result_string`.

<<<Output>>>
Pythno
