The function `sum_digits` is a recursive function that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number n.
The input number n is 345.
The function checks if n is 0, and since it's not, it proceeds to the else block.
It calculates the remainder of n divided by 10, which is 5 (the last digit of 345), and then calls itself with the integer division of n by 10, which is 34.
The function is now called with n = 34.
Again, n is not 0, so it calculates the remainder of 34 divided by 10, which is 4, and calls itself with n = 3 (integer division of 34 by 10).
The function is now called with n = 3.
Once more, n is not 0, so it calculates the remainder of 3 divided by 10, which is 3, and calls itself with n = 0 (integer division of 3 by 10).
The function is now called with n = 0.
This time, n is 0, so the function returns 0.
Now, the recursion starts to unwind, and the return values are added together:
0 (from n = 0) + 3 (from n = 3) = 3
3 (previous sum) + 4 (from n = 34) = 7
7 (previous sum) + 5 (from n = 345) = 12
The final result is 12, which is the sum of the digits of 345.
