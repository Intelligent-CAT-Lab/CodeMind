<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_negativenum` is defined to take a list of numbers as input.
The input list is `[2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17]`.
The function uses the `filter` function with a lambda function to filter out all the negative numbers from the input list. The lambda function checks if a number is less than 0.
The filtered list of negative numbers is `[-6, -9, -12, -5]`.
The `sum` function is then called on this filtered list to calculate the sum of all negative numbers.
The sum of the negative numbers is `-6 + -9 + -12 + -5`, which equals `-32`.
The function returns this sum, which is `-32`.
<<<Output>>>
-32
