<<<Analysis>>>
The input array is `[1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]`.
The array is sorted, resulting in `[1,1,1,2,3,4,5,6]`.
The variable `sum` is initialized to the first element of the sorted array, which is `1`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the array minus 1, which is 7 in this case.
The loop checks if the current element is not equal to the next element. If they are not equal, it adds the next element to `sum`.
The condition is met when `i` is 0 (comparing the second `1`), 2 (comparing `1` and `2`), 3 (comparing `2` and `3`), 4 (comparing `3` and `4`), 5 (comparing `4` and `5`), and 6 (comparing `5` and `6`).
The sum of unique elements is calculated as `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `sum`, which is `21`.
<<<Output>>>
21
