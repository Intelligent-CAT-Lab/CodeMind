<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_Pairs` takes an array `arr` and an integer `n` as its parameters. The array `arr` is initialized to [1,2,1], and `n` is initialized to 3, indicating the number of elements in the array.

The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of pairs where the elements are different.

The code then enters a nested loop:
- The outer loop runs from index 0 to n-1 (i.e., 0 to 2).
- The inner loop runs from the current index of the outer loop plus 1 (i.e., i+1) to n-1.

For each pair of indices (i, j), the code checks if the elements at these indices are different (`arr[i] != arr[j]`). If they are different, it increments `cnt` by 1.

The pairs of indices that will be checked are:
- (0, 1): arr[0] is 1 and arr[1] is 2, they are different, so cnt becomes 1.
- (0, 2): arr[0] is 1 and arr[2] is 1, they are not different, so cnt remains 1.
- (1, 2): arr[1] is 2 and arr[2] is 1, they are different, so cnt becomes 2.

After the loops finish, the function returns the final value of `cnt`, which is 2.
