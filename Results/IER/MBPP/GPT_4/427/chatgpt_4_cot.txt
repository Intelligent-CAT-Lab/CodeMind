<<<Analysis>>>
The function `change_date_format` takes a string `dt` as input, which is expected to be a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
The function uses the `re.sub` method from the `re` (regular expression) module to find patterns in the string that match the regular expression `r'(\d{4})-(\d{1,2})-(\d{1,2})'`. This pattern corresponds to a date format where:
- `\d{4}` matches exactly four digits, representing the year.
- `\d{1,2}` matches one or two digits, representing the month.
- `\d{1,2}` matches one or two digits, representing the day.
The parentheses around each of these parts create capture groups that can be referred to later in the replacement pattern.

The replacement pattern `'\\3-\\2-\\1'` indicates that the matched date should be reformatted by placing the third capture group (the day) first, followed by the second capture group (the month), and then the first capture group (the year), with hyphens between them.

When the function is called with the argument `"2026-01-02"`, the regular expression matches the entire string, and the replacement pattern changes the format of the date to "DD-MM-YYYY".

Therefore, the return value of the function will be the string `"02-01-2026"`.
