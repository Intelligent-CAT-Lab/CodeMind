<<<Analysis>>>
The function `average_tuple` takes a single argument `nums`, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples, each containing numbers.
The input provided is a tuple of four tuples: ((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4)).

The function uses a list comprehension to calculate the average of each corresponding element in the tuples. The `zip(*nums)` function is used to group the elements from each tuple by their index. This means that the first group will contain all the first elements of the tuples, the second group will contain all the second elements, and so on.

The `zip(*nums)` will result in an iterator that produces the following tuples when iterated:
(10, 30, 81, 1), (10, 45, 80, 2), (10, 56, 39, 3), (12, 45, 32, 4)

The list comprehension then calculates the average for each of these tuples:
- The average of the first tuple (10, 30, 81, 1) is (10 + 30 + 81 + 1) / 4 = 122 / 4 = 30.5
- The average of the second tuple (10, 45, 80, 2) is (10 + 45 + 80 + 2) / 4 = 137 / 4 = 34.25
- The average of the third tuple (10, 56, 39, 3) is (10 + 56 + 39 + 3) / 4 = 108 / 4 = 27.0
- The average of the fourth tuple (12, 45, 32, 4) is (12 + 45 + 32 + 4) / 4 = 93 / 4 = 23.25

The result is a list of these averages: [30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]

The function returns this list as the final result.
