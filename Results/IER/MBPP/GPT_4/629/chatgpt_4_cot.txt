<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Split` takes a list as an argument.
The function returns a new list that contains only the even numbers from the input list.
The input list is `[1,2,3,4,5]`.
The list comprehension iterates over each number in the input list and checks if it is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`.
The numbers 2 and 4 from the input list satisfy this condition.
Therefore, the function will return a list containing the numbers `[2, 4]`.
<<<Output>>>
[2, 4]
