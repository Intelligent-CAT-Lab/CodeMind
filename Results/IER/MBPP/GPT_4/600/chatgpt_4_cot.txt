<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_Even` takes an integer n as input and checks if it is even using bitwise XOR operation.
The expression `(n^1 == n+1)` uses the XOR operator `^` to compare the result of `n XOR 1` with `n+1`.
For the input `is_Even(1)`:
- `n` is initialized to 1.
- The XOR operation is performed between `n` (which is 1) and 1, resulting in `1^1`, which equals 0.
- The result of the XOR operation (0) is compared with `n+1` (which is 2).
- Since 0 is not equal to 2, the condition `(n^1 == n+1)` is False.
- Therefore, the function returns False, indicating that the number 1 is not even.
