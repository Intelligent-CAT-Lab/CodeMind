<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_min_diff` takes an array `arr` and an integer `n` as its parameters. The array `arr` is initialized to `(1,5,3,19,18,25)` and `n` is initialized to `6`.

1. The array `arr` is sorted, resulting in the array `(1, 3, 5, 18, 19, 25)`.
2. A variable `diff` is initialized to a very large number `10**20` to ensure that any actual difference found will be smaller.
3. The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive), meaning it will consider pairs of elements from the sorted array.
4. For each pair of adjacent elements in the sorted array, it calculates the difference between them.
5. If the calculated difference is smaller than the current `diff`, the `diff` is updated to this new value.
6. The differences between adjacent elements are as follows: `3-1=2`, `5-3=2`, `18-5=13`, `19-18=1`, `25-19=6`.
7. The smallest difference is `1`, which is found between `18` and `19`.
8. After the loop finishes, the function returns the smallest difference found, which is `1`.
