<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The variable S is calculated using the formula S = (n*(n + 1))//2, which is the sum of the first n natural numbers. For n = 3, S = (3*(3 + 1))//2 = (3*4)//2 = 12//2 = 6.
The variable res is calculated using the formula res = S*(S-1). For S = 6, res = 6*(6-1) = 6*5 = 30.
The function returns the value of res, which is 30.
<<<Output>>>
30
