<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_Set_Bits` is designed to count the number of set bits (bits that are 1) in the binary representation of a given integer n.

The variable `n` is initialized to 2.
The variable `count` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of set bits.

The code enters a while loop that will continue as long as `n` is not 0.

In the first iteration:
- `count` is incremented by `n & 1`. Since `n` is 2, its binary representation is '10'. The operation `2 & 1` results in 0, because the last bit of 2 is 0. So, `count` remains 0.
- `n` is right-shifted by 1 bit using `n >>= 1`. Now `n` becomes 1, which in binary is '1'.

In the second iteration:
- `count` is incremented by `n & 1`. Now `n` is 1, and `1 & 1` results in 1, so `count` is incremented to 1.
- `n` is right-shifted by 1 bit again, which results in `n` becoming 0.

The while loop ends because `n` is now 0.

The function returns the value of `count`, which is 1.
