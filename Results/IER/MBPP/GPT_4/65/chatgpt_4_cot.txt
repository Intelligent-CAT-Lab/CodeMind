<<<Analysis>>>
The function `recursive_list_sum` is designed to calculate the sum of all numbers in a nested list structure. The input provided is a nested list: [1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]].

1. The function initializes `total` to 0.
2. It then enters a for loop to iterate over each element in the input list.
3. The first element is 1, which is not a list, so it is added to `total`, making `total` now 1.
4. The second element is 2, which is also not a list, so it is added to `total`, making `total` now 3.
5. The third element is a list: [3,4]. The function calls itself recursively with this list.
   - In the recursive call, `total` is again initialized to 0.
   - It adds 3 to `total`, making it 3.
   - It adds 4 to `total`, making it 7.
   - The recursive call returns 7, which is added to the main `total`, making it now 10.
6. The fourth element is another list: [5,6]. The function calls itself recursively with this list.
   - In the recursive call, `total` is again initialized to 0.
   - It adds 5 to `total`, making it 5.
   - It adds 6 to `total`, making it 11.
   - The recursive call returns 11, which is added to the main `total`, making it now 21.
7. The function has now finished iterating over all elements in the input list and returns the `total`, which is 21.
