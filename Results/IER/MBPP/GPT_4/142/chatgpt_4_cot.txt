The function `count_samepair` takes three lists as input and returns the count of positions where the elements in all three lists are the same.

The lists provided as input are:
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
list2 = [2,2,3,1,2,6,7,9]
list3 = [2,1,3,1,2,6,7,9]

The `zip` function is used to combine the lists element-wise, resulting in an iterator of tuples where each tuple contains elements from the same position in each list.

The resulting tuples are:
(1, 2, 2), (2, 2, 1), (3, 3, 3), (4, 1, 1), (5, 2, 2), (6, 6, 6), (7, 7, 7), (8, 9, 9)

The `sum` function is then used with a generator expression that checks if all three elements in each tuple are equal (m == n == o). The expression `m == n == o` evaluates to `True` if all three elements are the same, and `False` otherwise. `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0` when summed.

The tuples that have all elements equal are:
(3, 3, 3), (6, 6, 6), (7, 7, 7)

There are 3 tuples where all elements are the same, so the sum of these `True` values is 3.

The function will return the result, which is 3.
