The function `group_tuples` takes a list of tuples as input and groups them by the first element of each tuple.

The input is `[('x', 'y'), ('x', 'z'), ('w', 't')]`.

An empty dictionary `out` is initialized.

The function then iterates over each tuple in the input list.

1. For the first tuple `('x', 'y')`, the function tries to extend the list corresponding to the key `'x'` in the dictionary `out`. Since the key does not exist yet, a `KeyError` is caught, and a new list with the tuple `('x', 'y')` is created and assigned to the key `'x'`.

2. For the second tuple `('x', 'z')`, the function again tries to extend the list corresponding to the key `'x'`. This time, the key exists, so the `extend` method is called with the elements of the tuple except the first one, which is `'z'`. The list for key `'x'` now becomes `['x', 'y', 'z']`.

3. For the third tuple `('w', 't')`, the function tries to extend the list corresponding to the key `'w'`. Since the key does not exist, a `KeyError` is caught, and a new list with the tuple `('w', 't')` is created and assigned to the key `'w'`.

After processing all tuples, the dictionary `out` looks like this:
{
    'x': ['x', 'y', 'z'],
    'w': ['w', 't']
}

The function then returns a list of tuples created from the values of the dictionary `out`. The resulting list of tuples is:
[('x', 'y', 'z'), ('w', 't')]

<<<Output>>>
[('x', 'y', 'z'), ('w', 't')]
