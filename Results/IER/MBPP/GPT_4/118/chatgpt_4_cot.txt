<<<Analysis>>>
The function `string_to_list` takes a single argument, which is a string.
The input string "python programming" is passed to the function.
Inside the function, the `split` method is called on the input string with a space (" ") as the delimiter. This method splits the string into a list of substrings where each space indicates a split point.
The result of the split operation is a list containing the substrings ["python", "programming"].
This list is then returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
['python', 'programming']
