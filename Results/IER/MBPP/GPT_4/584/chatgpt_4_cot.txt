<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_adverbs` takes a single string argument `text`.
The regular expression `r"\w+ly"` is used to find all words that end with "ly".
The `re.finditer` function is used to find all non-overlapping matches of the regular expression in the string `text`.
The loop iterates over each match object `m` found by `re.finditer`.
For the first match, it returns a string formatted as `'{start_index}-{end_index}: {matched_word}'`.
The input text is "Clearly, he has no excuse for such behavior.".
The first word that matches the pattern is "Clearly".
The start index of "Clearly" is 0, and the end index is 7.
Since the function returns after finding the first match, it does not continue to find any other adverbs in the text.
The output will be the start and end indices of the word "Clearly" along with the word itself, formatted as specified.

0-7: Clearly
