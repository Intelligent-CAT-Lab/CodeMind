<<<Analysis>>>
The variable Input is initialized to the tuple `([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])`.
The function `find_lists` checks if Input is an instance of a list using `isinstance(Input, list)`.
Since Input is a tuple, not a list, the condition is False.
The `else` block is executed, which returns the length of the Input using `len(Input)`.
The length of the tuple `([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8])` is 2, because it contains two elements (which are lists).
