<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_equal` is called with the input `[(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)]`.
Inside `get_equal`, the function `find_equal_tuple` is called with the same input.
In `find_equal_tuple`, the variable `k` is initialized to the length of the first tuple in the input, which is 3.
The variable `flag` is initialized to 1, which will be used to indicate whether all tuples have the same length.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each tuple in the input.
For each tuple, it checks if the length of the tuple is equal to `k`. If not, `flag` is set to 0 and the loop breaks.
Since all tuples in the input have the same length (3), the loop completes without changing `flag` from 1.
The function `find_equal_tuple` returns the value of `flag`, which is 1.
Back in `get_equal`, it checks if the returned value is equal to 1, which it is.
Therefore, `get_equal` returns `True`.
