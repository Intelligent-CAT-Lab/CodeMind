<<<Analysis>>>
The function `reverse_Array_Upto_K` takes two arguments: `input`, which is a list, and `k`, which is an integer.
The list `input` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, and `k` is `4`.
The function returns a new list that is a concatenation of two parts:
1. The first part is the slice of the input list from the start up to the k-th element, reversed. This is achieved by `input[k-1::-1]`, which starts from the element at index `k-1` (which is `3` in this case, since `k` is `4`) and goes backwards to the start of the list. The resulting slice is `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.
2. The second part is the slice of the input list from the k-th element to the end, which remains unchanged. This is achieved by `input[k:]`, which starts from the element at index `k` (which is `4` in this case) to the end of the list. The resulting slice is `[5, 6]`.

The function concatenates these two parts to form the final list, which is `[4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]`.
<<<Output>>>
[4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]
