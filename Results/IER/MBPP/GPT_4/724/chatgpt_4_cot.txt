<<<Analysis>>>
The function `power_base_sum` takes two arguments, `base` and `power`. It calculates the result of `base` raised to the `power` using `pow(base, power)`, then converts this number to a string.
The list comprehension `[int(i) for i in str(pow(base, power))]` creates a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from the string representation of `base` raised to `power`.
The `sum` function then adds up all the integers in the list to get the final result.
For `power_base_sum(2,100)`, the function calculates `2` raised to the `100th` power, which is a very large number. It then sums the digits of this number to get the final result.
Since the actual number `2**100` is too large to calculate manually, we rely on the function to compute the sum of its digits.
