<<<Analysis>>>
The function `surfacearea_cylinder` takes two arguments, `r` and `h`, which represent the radius and height of a cylinder, respectively.
The radius `r` is set to 10 and the height `h` is set to 5.
The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is given by the expression `((2*π*r^2) + (2*π*r*h))`, where π is approximated as 3.1415 in this function.
The first part of the formula calculates the area of the two circular bases of the cylinder: `2*3.1415*10*10`, which equals `2*3.1415*100`, or `628.30`.
The second part of the formula calculates the area of the side of the cylinder (the lateral surface area): `2*3.1415*10*5`, which equals `2*3.1415*50`, or `314.15`.
The total surface area is the sum of the areas of the bases and the lateral surface: `628.30 + 314.15`, which equals `942.45`.
Therefore, the function will return the total surface area of the cylinder with a radius of 10 and a height of 5, which is `942.45`.
<<<Output>>>
942.45
