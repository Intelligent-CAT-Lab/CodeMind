<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and n are initialized to 2, 3, and 7, respectively.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used to find a solution where i * a + j * b = n, with j being calculated in the loop.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as i * a is less than or equal to n.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the remainder of (n - (i * a)) divided by b is 0. If it is, it means that there is a pair (i, j) that satisfies the equation.
The loop starts with i = 0, and checks if (7 - (0 * 2)) % 3 == 0, which simplifies to 7 % 3 == 0. This is false.
The loop increments i to 1, and checks if (7 - (1 * 2)) % 3 == 0, which simplifies to 5 % 3 == 0. This is false.
The loop increments i to 2, and checks if (7 - (2 * 2)) % 3 == 0, which simplifies to 3 % 3 == 0. This is true.
Since the condition is met, the function returns the tuple (i, (n - (i * a)) // b), which is (2, (7 - (2 * 2)) // 3), simplifying to (2, 1).
The function will return the tuple (2, 1).
<<<Output>>>
(2, 1)
