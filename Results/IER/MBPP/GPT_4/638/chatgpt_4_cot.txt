<<<Analysis>>>
The function `wind_chill` takes two arguments, `v` for wind speed in kilometers per hour and `t` for temperature in degrees Celsius. The values passed to the function are `v=120` and `t=35`.

The formula used inside the function is the wind chill index, which is a measure of how cold it feels outside when the wind is factored in with the actual air temperature.

The formula is as follows:
windchill = 13.12 + 0.6215*t - 11.37*math.pow(v, 0.16) + 0.3965*t*math.pow(v, 0.16)

Substituting the given values into the formula:
windchill = 13.12 + 0.6215*35 - 11.37*math.pow(120, 0.16) + 0.3965*35*math.pow(120, 0.16)

Calculating the power terms:
math.pow(120, 0.16) is approximately 2.29739670999407

Now, substituting the power term back into the formula:
windchill = 13.12 + 0.6215*35 - 11.37*2.29739670999407 + 0.3965*35*2.29739670999407

Performing the multiplication and subtraction:
windchill = 13.12 + 21.7525 - 26.122601 - 31.8725

Adding and subtracting the terms:
windchill = 13.12 + 21.7525 - 26.122601 + 31.8725

windchill = 40.6224 - 26.122601

windchill = 14.499799

The function then rounds the result to the nearest whole number and converts it to an integer:
int(round(windchill, 0)) = int(round(14.499799, 0)) = int(14)

The final result is 14, which is the wind chill index for the given wind speed and temperature.
