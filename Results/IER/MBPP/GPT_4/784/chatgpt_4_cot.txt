<<<Analysis>>>
The function `mul_even_odd` takes a list `list1` as input.
The variable `first_even` is initialized by finding the first even number in `list1` using a generator expression. If no even number is found, it defaults to -1.
The variable `first_odd` is initialized by finding the first odd number in `list1` using a generator expression. If no odd number is found, it defaults to -1.
The input list is `[1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8]`.
The first odd number found in the list is 1.
The first even number found in the list is 4.
The function returns the product of `first_even` and `first_odd`, which is 1 * 4.
<<<Output>>>
