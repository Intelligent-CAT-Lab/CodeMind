<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_series` is a recursive function that sums up numbers in a series where each number is 2 less than the previous one, starting from the input number `n` until it reaches a number less than 1.

Here's the step-by-step analysis for `sum_series(6)`:

1. `sum_series(6)` is called.
2. Since 6 is not less than 1, it proceeds to return `6 + sum_series(6 - 2)`.
3. Now, `sum_series(4)` needs to be evaluated.
4. Since 4 is not less than 1, it proceeds to return `4 + sum_series(4 - 2)`.
5. Now, `sum_series(2)` needs to be evaluated.
6. Since 2 is not less than 1, it proceeds to return `2 + sum_series(2 - 2)`.
7. Now, `sum_series(0)` needs to be evaluated.
8. Since 0 is less than 1, it returns 0.
9. Going back up the recursion, `sum_series(2)` returns `2 + 0`, which is 2.
10. `sum_series(4)` returns `4 + 2`, which is 6.
11. Finally, `sum_series(6)` returns `6 + 6`, which is 12.

The final result of `sum_series(6)` is 12.
