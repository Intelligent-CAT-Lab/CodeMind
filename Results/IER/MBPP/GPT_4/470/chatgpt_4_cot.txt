<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add_pairwise` takes a single tuple `test_tup` as an argument.
The tuple `test_tup` is initialized to (1, 5, 7, 8, 10).
The function creates a new tuple `res` by adding each element of `test_tup` to the next element. This is done using the `zip` function which pairs each element with the next one (except the last, as there is no next element for it).
The `zip` function pairs elements as follows: (1,5), (5,7), (7,8), (8,10).
The sum of each pair is calculated and stored in the new tuple `res`: (1+5, 5+7, 7+8, 8+10) which results in (6, 12, 15, 18).
The function returns the new tuple `res`.
<<<Output>>>
(6, 12, 15, 18)
