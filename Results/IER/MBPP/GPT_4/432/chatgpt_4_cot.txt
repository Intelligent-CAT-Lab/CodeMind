<<<Analysis>>>
The function `median_trapezium` takes three arguments: `base1`, `base2`, and `height`. However, the `height` parameter is not used in the function.
The variables `base1` and `base2` are initialized to 15 and 25, respectively.
The variable `median` is calculated as the average of `base1` and `base2`, which is `(15 + 25) / 2`.
The calculation results in `median` being `20.0`.
The function returns the value of `median`.
<<<Output>>>
20.0
