<<<Analysis>>>
The function `minimum` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are initialized to 1 and 2, respectively.
The function checks if `a` is less than or equal to `b` using an if-else statement.
Since `a` (which is 1) is indeed less than `b` (which is 2), the condition `a <= b` is true.
Therefore, the function returns the value of `a`.
The return value of the function `minimum(1,2)` is 1.
