<<<Analysis>>>
The variable number is initialized to 8.
The variable divisors is initialized to a list containing the number 1, which is a divisor of every number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to number-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 7.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if it is a divisor of the input number (8) by using the modulo operator. If the remainder is 0, it means i is a divisor, and it is appended to the divisors list.
The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, and 4. These are found in the loop and added to the divisors list.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the sum of the divisors list, which is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.
