<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_product_even` takes a list `arr` as input.
The function iterates over each element in the list `arr` using a for loop.
For each element `arr[i]`, the function checks if the element is even by performing a bitwise AND operation with 1 (`arr[i] & 1`). If the result is 0, the element is even.
When the loop reaches the element 2, the condition `(arr[i] & 1) == 0` is satisfied because 2 is an even number.
Since the condition is met, the function returns `True` immediately without checking the rest of the elements in the list.
The loop does not continue after finding the first even number, so the function does not check the element 3.
