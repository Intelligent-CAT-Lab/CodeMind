<<<Analysis>>>
The function `min_k` takes two arguments: `test_list`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of a string and an integer, and `K`, which is an integer.
The list `test_list` is sorted based on the second element of each tuple (the integer), in ascending order.
The sorted list is then sliced to include only the first `K` elements. In this case, `K` is 2, so only the first two elements of the sorted list will be included in the result.
The sorted list will be `[('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4), ('Nikhil', 8), ('Manjeet', 10)]`.
Slicing the first two elements gives us `[('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4)]`.
This sliced list is returned as the result of the function.
<<<Output>>>
[('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4)]
