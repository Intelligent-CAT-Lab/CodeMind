<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n.
The code enters a loop that iterates from n down to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 10 down to 1.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if i is a power of 2. This is done by using the bitwise AND operation: (i & (i - 1)). If the result of this operation is 0, then i is a power of 2.
The loop starts with i = 10, which is not a power of 2, so it continues.
It then checks i = 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5, which are also not powers of 2.
When i = 8, the condition ((i & (i - 1)) == 0) is true because 8 is a power of 2 (2^3). Therefore, res is set to 8 and the loop breaks.
The function returns the value of res, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
