<<<Analysis>>>
The function `tuple_to_int` takes a single argument `nums`, which is expected to be a tuple of integers.
The tuple `nums` is (1, 2, 3).
The function uses the `map` function to convert each integer in the tuple to a string.
The `map` function is wrapped with `''.join()`, which concatenates the string representations of the numbers in the tuple, resulting in a single string "123".
The `int` function is then used to convert the string "123" back to an integer.
The result is the integer 123, which is then returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
123
