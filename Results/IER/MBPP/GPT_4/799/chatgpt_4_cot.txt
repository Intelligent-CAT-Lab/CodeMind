The function `left_rotate` takes two arguments, `n` and `d`, which are initialized to 16 and 2, respectively.
The constant `INT_BITS` is set to 32, which represents the size of an integer in bits.

The function performs a left rotation on the binary representation of `n` by `d` bits. This is done in two steps:
1. `(n << d)`: This left-shifts the binary representation of `n` by `d` bits. Since `n` is 16, its binary representation is `00000000000000000000000000010000`. Left-shifting by 2 bits gives `00000000000000000000000001000000`, which is 64 in decimal.
2. `(n >> (INT_BITS - d))`: This right-shifts the binary representation of `n` by `INT_BITS - d` bits. Since `INT_BITS` is 32 and `d` is 2, this means right-shifting by 30 bits. The binary representation of `n` right-shifted by 30 bits is `00000000000000000000000000000000`, which is 0 in decimal.

The function then combines these two values using the bitwise OR operator `|`. The result of the OR operation between 64 (from the left-shift) and 0 (from the right-shift) is 64.

Therefore, the return value of `left_rotate(16,2)` is 64.
