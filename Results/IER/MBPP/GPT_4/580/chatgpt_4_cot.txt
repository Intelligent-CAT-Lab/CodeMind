<<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_even` is called with the tuple `(4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)` as its argument.
Inside `extract_even`, the function `even_ele` is called with the same tuple and a lambda function that checks if a number is even (`lambda x: x % 2 == 0`).

The `even_ele` function initializes an empty tuple `res`.
It then iterates over each element in the input tuple:
- For the first element, 4, the lambda function returns True (since 4 is even), so 4 is added to `res`.
- For the second element, 5, the lambda function returns False (since 5 is not even), so nothing is added to `res`.
- For the third element, which is a nested tuple `(7, 6, (2, 4))`, the function calls itself recursively.
  - Inside this recursive call, it again initializes an empty tuple `res`.
  - It checks the first element, 7, which is not even, so nothing is added.
  - It checks the second element, 6, which is even, so 6 is added to the new `res`.
  - It checks the third element, which is another nested tuple `(2, 4)`, and calls itself recursively again.
    - Inside this recursive call, it initializes an empty tuple `res`.
    - It checks the first element, 2, which is even, so 2 is added to the new `res`.
    - It checks the second element, 4, which is even, so 4 is added to the new `res`.
    - This recursive call returns the tuple `(2, 4)`.
  - The tuple `(6, (2, 4))` is added to the `res` of the previous recursive call.
- For the fourth element, 6, the lambda function returns True, so 6 is added to `res`.
- For the fifth element, 8, the lambda function returns True, so 8 is added to `res`.

After iterating through all elements, the `even_ele` function returns the tuple `(4, (6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)`.
This is the result of the `extract_even` function call.

(4, (6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)
