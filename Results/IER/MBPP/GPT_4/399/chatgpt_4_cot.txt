<<<Analysis>>>
The function `bitwise_xor` takes two tuples as input, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
The tuples for this example are initialized as `test_tup1 = (10, 4, 6, 9)` and `test_tup2 = (5, 2, 3, 3)`.
The function computes the bitwise XOR (`^`) between corresponding elements of the two tuples.
The `zip` function is used to pair up elements from the two tuples.
The bitwise XOR is computed as follows:
- 10 ^ 5 = 15
- 4 ^ 2 = 6
- 6 ^ 3 = 5
- 9 ^ 3 = 10
The result is a tuple containing these values: `(15, 6, 5, 10)`.
The function returns this tuple as the result.
<<<Output>>>
(15, 6, 5, 10)
