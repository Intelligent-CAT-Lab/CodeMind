<<<Analysis>>>
The function `drop_empty` takes a dictionary as an input. The input dictionary is `{'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green', 'c3': None}`.
The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that only includes items where the value is not `None`.
The dictionary comprehension iterates over each (key, value) pair in the input dictionary.
For each pair, it checks if the value is not `None`. If the value is not `None`, the pair is included in the new dictionary.
The pairs 'c1': 'Red' and 'c2': 'Green' have values that are not `None`, so they are included in the new dictionary.
The pair 'c3': None has a value that is `None`, so it is not included in the new dictionary.
The function returns the new dictionary, which only contains the pairs where the values are not `None`.
<<<Output>>>
{'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}
