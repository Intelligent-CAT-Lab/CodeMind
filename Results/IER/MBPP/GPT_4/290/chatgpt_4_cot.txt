<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_length` takes a single argument `list1`, which is a list of lists.
The variable `max_length` is initialized to the length of the longest sublist within `list1` by using a generator expression `max(len(x) for x in list1)`. The lengths of the sublists are 1, 2, 2, 2, and 3, respectively. Therefore, `max_length` is set to 3.
The variable `max_list` is initialized to the maximum sublist within `list1` by using a generator expression `max((x) for x in list1)`. Since the sublists are compared lexicographically, the maximum sublist is `[9, 11]` because it starts with the largest number when compared to the first elements of the other sublists.
The function returns a tuple `(max_length, max_list)`, which in this case will be `(3, [9, 11])`.
<<<Output>>>
(3, [9, 11])
