<<<Analysis>>>
The function `square_Sum` takes a single argument `n`, which is set to 2.
The function calculates the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `2*n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)/3`.
Substituting the value of `n` with 2, the calculation is as follows:
2*2*(2+1)*(2*2+1)/3
= 4*3*5/3
= 12*5/3
= 60/3
= 20
The function returns the result of this calculation as an integer.
<<<Output>>>
20
