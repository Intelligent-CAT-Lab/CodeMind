The function `re_arrange_array` takes an array `arr` and its length `n` as arguments. The array given is `[-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9]` and `n` is `9`.

The variable `j` is initialized to `0`. This variable will keep track of the position where the next negative number should be placed.

The code enters a loop that iterates from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive), meaning it will consider all elements of the array.

For each element `arr[i]`, the code checks if it is negative. If it is, it performs a swap operation with the element at index `j` and increments `j` by `1`.

The swap operation is performed as follows:
- When `i` is `0`, `arr[i]` is `-1`, which is negative. It swaps with itself since `j` is also `0`. The array remains unchanged, and `j` becomes `1`.
- When `i` is `1`, `arr[i]` is `2`, which is not negative. No swap is performed.
- When `i` is `2`, `arr[i]` is `-3`, which is negative. It swaps with `arr[j]`, which is `2`. The array becomes `[-1, -3, 2, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9]`, and `j` becomes `2`.
- When `i` is `3`, `arr[i]` is `4`, which is not negative. No swap is performed.
- When `i` is `4`, `arr[i]` is `5`, which is not negative. No swap is performed.
- When `i` is `5`, `arr[i]` is `6`, which is not negative. No swap is performed.
- When `i` is `6`, `arr[i]` is `-7`, which is negative. It swaps with `arr[j]`, which is `2`. The array becomes `[-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9]`, and `j` becomes `3`.
- When `i` is `7`, `arr[i]` is `8`, which is not negative. No swap is performed.
- When `i` is `8`, `arr[i]` is `9`, which is not negative. No swap is performed.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the modified array, which is `[-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9]`.
