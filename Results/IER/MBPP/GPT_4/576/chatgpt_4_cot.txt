<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_Sub_Array` takes two lists A and B and checks if B is a sub-array of A.
The lengths of A and B are stored in variables n and m, respectively. For the given input, n is 4 and m is 2.
Two pointers i and j are initialized to 0. These pointers are used to traverse the arrays A and B, respectively.
The function enters a while loop that continues as long as i is less than n and j is less than m.
The loop checks if the current elements of A and B pointed by i and j are equal. If they are, both pointers are incremented.
If at any point j equals m, it means all elements of B have been found in A in sequence, and the function returns True.
If the elements are not equal, i is reset to (i - j + 1) and j is reset to 0. This effectively moves the starting comparison index in A forward by one and starts the comparison from the beginning of B.
For the given input, the loop will compare A[0] with B[0] and find them equal, incrementing both i and j.
Then it will compare A[1] with B[1] and find them not equal, so it will reset i to (1 - 1 + 1) which is 1, and j to 0.
The loop will continue comparing A[1] with B[0], A[2] with B[0], and A[3] with B[0], but none of these pairs are equal.
Since the loop will exit without j ever reaching the value of m, the function will return False, indicating that B is not a sub-array of A.
