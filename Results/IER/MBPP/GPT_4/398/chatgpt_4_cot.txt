<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_of_digits` takes a list of numbers as its argument. The list provided in the question is `[10, 2, 56]`.
The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each number in the list, and for each number, it iterates over each character in the string representation of the number.
The `isdigit()` method is used to check if the character is a digit. If it is, the character is converted to an integer and included in the sum.
The sum of all digits in the list is calculated as follows:
- For the first number, 10, the digits are 1 and 0, which sum to 1.
- For the second number, 2, the digit is 2, which adds to the sum, making it 3.
- For the third number, 56, the digits are 5 and 6, which sum to 11, adding to the previous sum to make 14.
The final sum of all digits in the list is 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
