<<<Analysis>>>
The function `maxAverageOfPath` is designed to calculate the maximum average of a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a 2D grid, where you can only move either down or right at any point in time. The average is calculated by dividing the total cost of the path by the number of steps taken, which is always `2 * N - 1` for an N x N grid.

The input grid is:
```
1 2 3
6 5 4
7 3 9
```

1. The size of the grid `N` is determined to be 3.
2. A 2D list `dp` is created to store the maximum cost to reach each cell.
3. The top-left corner `dp[0][0]` is initialized with the cost of the top-left cell, which is 1.
4. The first for loop fills the first column of `dp` with the cumulative sum of the costs in the first column of `cost`. After this loop, `dp` is:
```
1 0 0
7 0 0
14 0 0
```
5. The second for loop fills the first row of `dp` with the cumulative sum of the costs in the first row of `cost`. After this loop, `dp` is:
```
1 3 6
7 0 0
14 0 0
```
6. The nested for loops fill the rest of `dp` by taking the maximum of the cell above and to the left of the current cell and adding the cost of the current cell. After these loops, `dp` is:
```
1 3 6
7 10 14
14 17 25
```
7. The maximum cost to reach the bottom-right corner is `dp[2][2]`, which is 25.
8. The maximum average is calculated by dividing this cost by `2 * N - 1`, which is `25 / (2 * 3 - 1) = 25 / 5 = 5`.

Therefore, the return value of `maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]])` is 5.
