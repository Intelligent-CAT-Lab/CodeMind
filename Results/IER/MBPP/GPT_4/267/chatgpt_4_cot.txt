<<<Analysis>>>
The function `square_Sum` takes a single argument `n`, which is set to 2.
The function calculates the sum of squares of the first `n` positive integers using the formula `n*(4*n*n-1)/3`.
Substituting the value of `n` with 2, the calculation becomes `2*(4*2*2-1)/3`.
This simplifies to `2*(4*4-1)/3`, which is `2*(16-1)/3`.
Further simplifying, we get `2*15/3`, which is `30/3`.
Finally, the result is `10`.
The function returns this value as an integer.
<<<Output>>>
