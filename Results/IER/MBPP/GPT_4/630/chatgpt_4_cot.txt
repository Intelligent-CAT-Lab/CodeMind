<<<Analysis>>>
The function `adjac` is a recursive generator function that takes a tuple `ele` and an optional list `sub`. It is designed to yield all combinations of coordinates adjacent to the given coordinates, including the coordinates themselves.

The function `get_coordinates` calls `adjac` with the input tuple `test_tup` and converts the generator into a list before returning it.

Here's the step-by-step analysis for `get_coordinates((3, 4))`:

1. The `get_coordinates` function is called with `test_tup` equal to `(3, 4)`.
2. Inside `get_coordinates`, `adjac` is called with `ele` equal to `(3, 4)` and `sub` defaulted to `[]`.
3. In the first call to `adjac`, `ele` is not empty, so it does not yield `sub` but instead goes to the `else` block.
4. The `else` block contains a nested generator expression that iterates over the range from `ele[0] - 1` to `ele[0] + 2`, which is from `2` to `4` (inclusive) for the first element of `ele`.
5. For each value `j` in this range, `adjac` is called recursively with the rest of the tuple `ele[1:]`, which is `(4,)`, and the current list `sub` with `j` added to it.
6. In the recursive call, `ele` is `(4,)`, and the process repeats, this time iterating from `3` to `5` (inclusive) for the first element of `ele`.
7. For each value `j` in this new range, `adjac` is called recursively with an empty tuple `ele[1:]`, which is `()`, and the current list `sub` with `j` added to it.
8. Since `ele` is now empty, the recursive call yields `sub`, which contains a combination of adjacent coordinates.
9. This process generates all combinations of numbers from `2` to `4` for the first coordinate and from `3` to `5` for the second coordinate.
10. The final result is a list of all these combinations.

The expected output will be a list of tuples representing all combinations of coordinates adjacent to `(3, 4)`, including `(3, 4)` itself.
