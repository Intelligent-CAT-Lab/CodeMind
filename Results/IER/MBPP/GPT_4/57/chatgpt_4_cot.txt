<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_Max_Num` takes a list `arr` as an input.
The length of the array `arr` is determined and stored in variable `n`, which is 3 in this case.
The array `arr` is sorted in reverse order, which means it will be sorted from highest to lowest. After sorting, `arr` becomes [3, 2, 1].
The variable `num` is initialized with the first element of the sorted array, which is 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the second element to the last element of the array.
In each iteration, `num` is updated by multiplying it by 10 and then adding the current element of the array. This effectively shifts the current `num` one decimal place to the left and appends the current digit.
For the given input [1, 2, 3], the process will be as follows:
- Initially, `num` is 3.
- In the first iteration, `num` becomes 3 * 10 + 2, which is 32.
- In the second iteration, `num` becomes 32 * 10 + 1, which is 321.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `num`, which is 321.
<<<Output>>>
321
