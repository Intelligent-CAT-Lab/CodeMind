<<<Analysis>>>
The function `text_match_wordz_middle` takes a single argument `text` which is a string.
The function uses the `re.search` method from the `re` module to search for a pattern in the given text.
The pattern `r'\Bz\B'` is a regular expression that looks for the character 'z' that is not at a word boundary. This means 'z' must be surrounded by other word characters (like letters, digits, or underscore) on both sides and cannot be at the start or end of a word.
The text provided as input is "pythonzabc.".
The 'z' in "pythonzabc." is followed by a non-word character (a period), which means it is at a word boundary on the right side.
Since the 'z' is not surrounded by word characters on both sides, the pattern does not match.
The `re.search` method will return None because there is no match, and the `bool` function will convert this to `False`.
<<<Output>>>
False
