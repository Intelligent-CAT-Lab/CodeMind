<<<Analysis>>>
The function `and_tuples` takes two tuples as arguments, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
The function creates a new tuple `res` by performing a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
The `zip` function is used to pair up elements from both tuples based on their index.
The bitwise AND operation is performed as follows:
- 10 (1010 in binary) & 5 (0101 in binary) results in 0 (0000 in binary).
- 4 (0100 in binary) & 2 (0010 in binary) results in 0 (0000 in binary).
- 6 (0110 in binary) & 3 (0011 in binary) results in 2 (0010 in binary).
- 9 (1001 in binary) & 3 (0011 in binary) results in 1 (0001 in binary).
The resulting tuple from these operations is (0, 0, 2, 1).
The function returns this tuple.
<<<Output>>>
(0, 0, 2, 1)
