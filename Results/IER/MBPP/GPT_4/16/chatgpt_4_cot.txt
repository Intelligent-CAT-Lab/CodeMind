<<<Analysis>>>
The function `text_lowercase_underscore` is designed to check if the input text matches a specific pattern defined by the regular expression '^[a-z]+_[a-z]+$'.
The pattern '^[a-z]+_[a-z]+$' means that the text should start with one or more lowercase letters, followed by an underscore, and end with one or more lowercase letters.
The input text "aab_cbbbc" is passed to the function.
The function uses `re.search` to check if the input text matches the pattern.
The input "aab_cbbbc" does match the pattern because it starts with lowercase letters "aab", followed by an underscore "_", and ends with lowercase letters "cbbbc".
Since the input text matches the pattern, the function will return True.
<<<Output>>>
True
