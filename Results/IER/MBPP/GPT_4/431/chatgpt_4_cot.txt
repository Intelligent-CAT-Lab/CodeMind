<<<Analysis>>>
The function `common_element` takes two lists as input and initializes a variable `result` to `False`.
It then enters a nested loop, where it iterates over each element `x` in `list1` and for each `x`, it iterates over each element `y` in `list2`.
If it finds an element `x` that is equal to an element `y`, it sets `result` to `True` and immediately returns `result`.
In the given input, `common_element([1,2,3,4,5], [5,6,7,8,9])`, the function will compare each element from the first list with each element from the second list.
When it compares 5 from the first list with 5 from the second list, it finds a match.
At this point, `result` is set to `True` and the function returns `True`.
<<<Output>>>
True
