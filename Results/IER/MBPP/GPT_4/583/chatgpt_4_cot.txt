The function `catalan_number` is a recursive function that calculates the nth Catalan number. The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that have many applications in combinatorial mathematics.

The base case of the recursion is when `num` is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns 1.

For `catalan_number(10)`, the function will calculate the sum of the product of two Catalan numbers for all pairs of non-negative integers i and j such that i + j = 9 (since num is 10, we use num-i-1 for the second term).

The function will call itself recursively to calculate the Catalan numbers for smaller values and use those to build up the value for `catalan_number(10)`.

The calculation involves a lot of repeated calculations for the same values of `catalan_number(i)` for different i, which makes it very inefficient for large numbers. However, since we are only interested in the result for `catalan_number(10)`, we can calculate it step by step.

The calculation will proceed as follows:
- `catalan_number(0)` will be called and return 1.
- `catalan_number(1)` will be called and return 1.
- `catalan_number(2)` will be called and will calculate `catalan_number(0)*catalan_number(1) + catalan_number(1)*catalan_number(0)` which is 1*1 + 1*1 = 2.
- `catalan_number(3)` will be called and will calculate `catalan_number(0)*catalan_number(2) + catalan_number(1)*catalan_number(1) + catalan_number(2)*catalan_number(0)` which is 1*2 + 1*1 + 2*1 = 5.
- This process will continue until `catalan_number(10)` is calculated.

The final result for `catalan_number(10)` will be the 10th Catalan number, which is known to be 16796.
