<<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_whitespaces` is defined to take a single argument `text1`.
The function uses the `re.sub` method from the `re` (regular expression) module to replace one or more whitespace characters (`\s+`) with an empty string (`''`), effectively removing them from the input string.
The input string `' Google    Flutter '` has leading, trailing, and multiple spaces between the words "Google" and "Flutter".
The regular expression `\s+` matches all these spaces, and they are replaced with an empty string.
The expected output is the input string without any whitespace, which would be `'GoogleFlutter'`.
