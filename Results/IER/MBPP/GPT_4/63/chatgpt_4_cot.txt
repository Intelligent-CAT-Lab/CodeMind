<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_difference` takes a list of tuples as an argument. Each tuple contains two integers.
The list comprehension `temp = [abs(b - a) for a, b in test_list]` calculates the absolute difference between the two integers in each tuple and stores the results in a new list called `temp`.
For the input `[(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]`, the list comprehension will perform the following calculations:
- abs(5 - 3) = 2
- abs(7 - 1) = 6
- abs(3 - 10) = 7
- abs(2 - 1) = 1
So, `temp` will be `[2, 6, 7, 1]`.
The function then finds the maximum value in the `temp` list using `res = max(temp)`, which is 7.
Finally, the function returns the result `res`, which is the maximum absolute difference found in the list.
