<<<Analysis>>>
The function `text_match_one` takes a string `text` as input and defines a regular expression pattern 'ab+?'.
The pattern 'ab+?' is looking for the character 'a' followed by at least one 'b', but as few as possible due to the non-greedy quantifier '?'.
The `re.search` function is used to search for the pattern within the input text.
The input text "ac" does not contain the character 'a' followed by any 'b', so the pattern will not match.
Since the pattern does not match, `re.search` will return None, and the function will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
