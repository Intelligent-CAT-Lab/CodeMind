<<<Analysis>>>
The function `min_of_three` takes three arguments: a, b, and c, which are initialized to 10, 20, and 0, respectively.
The function then checks which of the three numbers is the smallest.
First, it checks if a is less than or equal to both b and c. Since a (10) is not less than or equal to c (0), this condition is false.
Next, it checks if b is less than or equal to both a and c. Since b (20) is not less than or equal to a (10) and c (0), this condition is also false.
Since neither of the first two conditions is true, the function proceeds to the else clause and assigns the value of c to the variable smallest.
Therefore, the smallest number among a, b, and c is c, which is 0.
The function returns the value of the smallest, which is 0.
