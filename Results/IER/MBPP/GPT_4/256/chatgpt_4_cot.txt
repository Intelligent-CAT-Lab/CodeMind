The function `count_Primes_nums` is designed to count the number of prime numbers less than a given number n. The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable ctr is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the prime numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (in this case, 0 to 4).
For each number num in this range, the code first checks if num is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the loop continues to the next iteration without doing anything because 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.
For num greater than 1, the code enters another loop that checks if num is divisible by any number from 2 to num-1. If num is divisible by any such number, it is not a prime number, and the loop breaks.
If num is not divisible by any number from 2 to num-1, the else block is executed, incrementing ctr by 1, indicating that num is a prime number.
The loop will check the numbers 2, 3, and 4. Among these, 2 and 3 are prime numbers, so ctr will be incremented twice.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of ctr, which is 2.
