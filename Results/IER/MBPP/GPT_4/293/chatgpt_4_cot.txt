<<<Analysis>>>
The function `otherside_rightangle` takes two arguments, `w` and `h`, which represent the width and height of a right-angled triangle, respectively.
The variables `w` and `h` are initialized to 7 and 8, respectively.
The function calculates the length of the hypotenuse `s` using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
The calculation is performed by squaring `w` and `h`, adding the results, and then taking the square root of the sum.
The square of `w` (7) is 49, and the square of `h` (8) is 64.
The sum of these squares is 49 + 64 = 113.
The square root of 113 is calculated using `math.sqrt`, which gives the length of the hypotenuse `s`.
The function returns the value of `s`, which is the square root of 113.
