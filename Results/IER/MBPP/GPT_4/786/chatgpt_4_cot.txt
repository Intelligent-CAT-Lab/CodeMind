<<<Analysis>>>
The function `right_insertion` takes two arguments: a list `a` and a value `x`.
The list `a` is `[1,2,4,5]` and the value `x` is `6`.
The function uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `x` in the sorted list `a`.
The `bisect_right` function returns the index at which `x` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain the sorted order.
Since `6` is greater than all elements in the list, it should be inserted at the end of the list.
The list has 4 elements, so the index for the insertion point is `4`.
