<<<Analysis>>>
The function `unique_sublists` takes a list of lists as input and returns a dictionary where each key is a tuple representing a unique sublist from the input, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that sublist appears in the input.

1. The input list is `[[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [13, 15, 17], [5, 7], [9, 11]]`.
2. The `result` dictionary is initialized as an empty dictionary.
3. The function iterates over each sublist `l` in `list1`.
4. For each sublist `l`, it converts `l` to a tuple and uses `setdefault` to add the tuple as a key to the `result` dictionary if it's not already present. The value is initialized as a list containing a single element `1`.
5. If the tuple is already a key in the dictionary, it appends `1` to the list associated with that key.
6. After the first loop, the `result` dictionary looks like this:
   {
       (1, 3): [1, 1],
       (5, 7): [1, 1],
       (13, 15, 17): [1],
       (9, 11): [1]
   }
7. The function then iterates over the items in the `result` dictionary.
8. For each key-value pair `(a, b)`, it sums the list `b` and updates the value associated with the key `a` in the `result` dictionary with this sum.
9. After the second loop, the `result` dictionary looks like this:
   {
       (1, 3): 2,
       (5, 7): 2,
       (13, 15, 17): 1,
       (9, 11): 1
   }
10. The function returns the `result` dictionary.
