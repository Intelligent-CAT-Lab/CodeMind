<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 35.
The function next_Perfect_Square takes N as an argument.
Inside the function, the square root of N is calculated using math.sqrt(N), which gives the square root of 35.
The floor of this square root is then taken using math.floor(), which rounds down to the nearest whole number. The square root of 35 is approximately 5.916, so the floor of this is 5.
This result is then incremented by 1, resulting in nextN being 6.
The next perfect square is calculated by squaring nextN, which is 6 * 6, equal to 36.
The function returns this value, which is the next perfect square after 35.
<<<Output>>>
36
