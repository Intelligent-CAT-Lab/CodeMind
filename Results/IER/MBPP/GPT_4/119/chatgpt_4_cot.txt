The function `search` takes an array `arr` as input.
The length of the array `arr` is determined and stored in the variable `n`, which is 5 in this case.
The variable `XOR` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the result of XOR operations on the array elements.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the array elements.
For each element `arr[i]` in the array, it performs an XOR operation with the current value of `XOR` and stores the result back in `XOR`.
The XOR operation has the property that `x ^ x = 0` and `x ^ 0 = x`. Therefore, all the pairs of identical numbers will cancel each other out.
The array `arr` is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`. The XOR operation proceeds as follows:
- XOR = 0 ^ 1 = 1
- XOR = 1 ^ 1 = 0 (since 1 ^ 1 cancels out)
- XOR = 0 ^ 2 = 2
- XOR = 2 ^ 2 = 0 (since 2 ^ 2 cancels out)
- XOR = 0 ^ 3 = 3
Since all pairs cancel each other out, the remaining number is the one without a pair, which is 3.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `XOR`, which is 3.
