The function `sum_Of_product(n)` calls `binomial_Coeff(2 * n, n - 1)`. For the input `sum_Of_product(3)`, it will call `binomial_Coeff(6, 2)`.

The `binomial_Coeff(n, k)` function calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, k), which is the coefficient of the x^k term in the polynomial expansion of the binomial power (1 + x)^n.

1. The list `C` is initialized with `k + 1` zeros. Since `k` is 2, `C` will be `[0, 0, 0]`.
2. `C[0]` is set to 1 because the binomial coefficient C(n, 0) is always 1 for any n.
3. The outer loop runs from 1 to `n + 1`, which is 7 in this case (since `n` is 6).
4. The inner loop runs from `min(i, k)` to 0 in reverse order. This loop updates the list `C` to hold the current values of the binomial coefficients.
5. For each `i`, the inner loop calculates `C[j]` as `C[j] + C[j - 1]`. This is based on the property of binomial coefficients: C(n, k) = C(n - 1, k) + C(n - 1, k - 1).
6. After the loops finish, `C[k]` will hold the value of the binomial coefficient C(6, 2).

Let's calculate the values of `C` after each iteration:
- i = 1: C = [1, 1, 0]
- i = 2: C = [1, 2, 1]
- i = 3: C = [1, 3, 3]
- i = 4: C = [1, 4, 6]
- i = 5: C = [1, 5, 10]
- i = 6: C = [1, 6, 15]

The final value of `C[2]` is 15, which is the binomial coefficient C(6, 2).

Therefore, the return value of `sum_Of_product(3)` will be 15.
