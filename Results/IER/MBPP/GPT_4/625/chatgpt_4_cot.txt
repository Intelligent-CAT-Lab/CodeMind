<<<Analysis>>>
The function `swap_List` is designed to swap the first and last elements of a given list.
The input list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
The variable `size` is initialized to the length of the list, which is 3.
The variable `temp` is assigned the value of the first element of the list, which is 1.
The first element of the list `newList[0]` is then replaced with the last element of the list `newList[size - 1]`, which is 3.
The last element of the list `newList[size - 1]` is then replaced with the value stored in `temp`, which is 1.
The list now becomes `[3, 2, 1]`.
The function returns the modified list.
<<<Output>>>
[3, 2, 1]
