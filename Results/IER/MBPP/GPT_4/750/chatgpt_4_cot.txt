<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_list is initialized to [5, 6, 7], and the variable test_tup is initialized to (9, 10).
The code then uses the += operator to add the elements of test_tup to the end of test_list. This operation modifies test_list in place.
After the operation, test_list contains [5, 6, 7, 9, 10].
The function returns the modified test_list.
<<<Output>>>
[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
