<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_product_tuple` takes a list of tuples as an argument. The list provided is `[(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)]`.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each tuple in the list and calculate the product of the two elements in each tuple. The `abs` function is used to ensure that the product is non-negative.
The products calculated are: 2*7=14, 2*6=12, 1*8=8, and 4*9=36.
The `max` function is then used to find the maximum value among these products, which is 36.
The function returns the maximum product, which is 36 in this case.
<<<Output>>>
36
