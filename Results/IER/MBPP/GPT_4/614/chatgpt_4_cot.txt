<<<Analysis>>>
The function `cummulative_sum` takes a list of tuples as an argument, which in this case is `[(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)]`.
The `map` function is used to apply the `sum` function to each tuple in the list. This will calculate the sum of each tuple individually.
The `sum` function is then used again to add up all the individual sums obtained from the previous step.
The individual sums of the tuples are:
- For the first tuple (1, 3), the sum is 1 + 3 = 4.
- For the second tuple (5, 6, 7), the sum is 5 + 6 + 7 = 18.
- For the third tuple (2, 6), the sum is 2 + 6 = 8.
The final cumulative sum is the sum of all individual sums: 4 + 18 + 8 = 30.
The function returns this cumulative sum, which is 30.
