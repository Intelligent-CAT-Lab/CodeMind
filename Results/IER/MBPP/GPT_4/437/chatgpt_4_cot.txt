<<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_odd` is designed to remove characters from the input string `str1` that are at odd indices and return a new string `str2` containing only the characters at even indices (1-indexed).

- The input string "python" is passed to the function.
- An empty string `str2` is initialized.
- The function enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of `str1` plus 1, which means it will consider indices from 1 to 6 (since "python" has 6 characters).
- Inside the loop, the function checks if the current index `i` is even (i % 2 == 0).
- If the index is even, the character at that index (1-indexed) is appended to `str2`.
- The characters at the 2nd, 4th, and 6th positions of "python" are 'y', 'h', and 'n', respectively.
- These characters are concatenated to form the new string `str2`, which is "yhn".

<<<Output>>>
"yhn"
