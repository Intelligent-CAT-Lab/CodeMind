<<<Analysis>>>
The function `even_position` takes a list `nums` as input.
The function uses the `all` function combined with a generator expression to check if all elements at even indices are even and all elements at odd indices are odd.
The generator expression iterates over the indices of the list `nums` using `range(len(nums))`.
For each index `i`, it checks whether the element at that index `nums[i]` has the same evenness as the index `i` itself (`nums[i]%2==i%2`).
The input list is `[3,2,1]`.
- For `i=0` (first element), `nums[i]%2==i%2` evaluates to `3%2==0%2`, which is `1==0`, which is `False`.
- Since the `all` function returns `False` as soon as one of the elements in the iterable is `False`, it does not need to check the rest of the elements.
Therefore, the function will return `False` without checking the rest of the elements.
