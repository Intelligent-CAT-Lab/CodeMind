<<<Analysis>>>
The function `tuple_size` takes a single argument `tuple_list`.
The `sys.getsizeof` function is called with `tuple_list` as its argument to get the size of the tuple in bytes.
The tuple `("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3)` is passed to the function.
The size of the tuple in memory is calculated by `sys.getsizeof`.
The exact size in bytes can vary based on the Python implementation and the system architecture, so without running the code in a specific environment, we cannot determine the exact output.
The function returns the size of the tuple in bytes.
<<<Output>>>
The output is the size of the tuple in bytes, which is implementation-specific and cannot be determined without executing the code in a specific environment.
