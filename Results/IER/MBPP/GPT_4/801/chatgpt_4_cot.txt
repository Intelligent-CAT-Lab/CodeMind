<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x, y, and z are initialized to 1, 1, and 1, respectively.
The code creates a set from the list [x, y, z], which will contain unique elements from the list. Since all three values are 1, the resulting set will be {1}.
The length of the set is checked. Since the set contains only one element, its length is 1.
The length of the set is compared to 3. Since the length is not equal to 3, the else block is executed.
The return value is calculated as 4 minus the length of the set, which is 4 - 1 = 3.
The function will return 3.
