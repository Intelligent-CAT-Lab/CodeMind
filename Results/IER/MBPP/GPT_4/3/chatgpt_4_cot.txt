<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_not_prime` is designed to check if a number `n` is not a prime number.
The input `n` is initialized to 2.
The variable `result` is initialized to `False`, which will be used to indicate if the number is not prime.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). However, since `n` is 2, the square root of `n` is also 2, and the range will be from 2 to 2 (inclusive).
The loop checks if `n` is divisible by `i` (which is 2 in this case). If it is, `result` is set to `True`.
Since 2 is a prime number and is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, the loop does not change the value of `result`.
After the loop, the function returns the value of `result`, which remains `False`.

False
