<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 5, 3, and 2, respectively.
The variable directrix is calculated using the formula provided in the function: c - ((b * b) + 1) * 4 * a.
First, b * b is calculated, which is 3 * 3 = 9.
Then, 9 + 1 is calculated, which equals 10.
Next, 10 * 4 * a is calculated, which is 10 * 4 * 5 = 200.
Finally, c - 200 is calculated, which is 2 - 200 = -198.
The result is then cast to an integer, although it is already an integer, so this has no effect.
The function returns the value of directrix, which is -198.
<<<Output>>>
-198
