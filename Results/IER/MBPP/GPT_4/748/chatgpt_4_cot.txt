<<<Analysis>>>
The function `capital_words_spaces` takes a single string argument `str1`.
The function uses the `re.sub` method from the `re` (regular expression) module to find all matches of the pattern `r"(\w)([A-Z])"` in the string `str1` and replace them with `r"\1 \2"`.
The pattern `r"(\w)([A-Z])"` looks for two consecutive characters where the first is any word character (denoted by `\w` which includes letters, digits, and underscores) and the second is an uppercase letter (denoted by `[A-Z]`).
The replacement pattern `r"\1 \2"` indicates that the first matched character (captured by `(\w)`) should be followed by a space and then the second matched character (captured by `([A-Z])`).
In the input "Python", there are no two consecutive characters where the first is any word character and the second is an uppercase letter. The first character 'P' is uppercase, but it is not preceded by a word character, and the rest of the characters are lowercase.
Therefore, the `re.sub` method will not perform any substitution, and the original string "Python" will be returned unchanged.

"Python"
