<<<Analysis>>>
The function `radian_degree` is defined to convert an angle from degrees to radians.
The variable `degree` is initialized to 90.
The function calculates the radian equivalent of the degree by multiplying the degree value by the ratio of pi to 180 (math.pi/180).
The value of math.pi is approximately 3.141592653589793.
The calculation inside the function is as follows: 90 * (3.141592653589793 / 180).
This simplifies to 90 * (0.017453292519943295).
The result of this calculation is 1.5707963267948966, which is the radian equivalent of 90 degrees.
<<<Output>>>
1.5707963267948966
