<<<Analysis>>>
The list is initialized to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and m is initialized to 3.
The function `rotate_right` is designed to rotate the list to the right by m positions.
The expression `list[-m:]` takes the last m elements from the list, which are [8, 9, 10].
The expression `list[:-m]` takes all elements from the list except the last m elements, which are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
The result is the concatenation of these two slices, which gives [8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
This is the list after being rotated to the right by 3 positions.
<<<Output>>>
[8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
