<<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_rear` takes a single argument `test_tuple` which is expected to be a tuple of strings.
The input provided is `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`.
The function initializes an empty list `res`.
It then uses a generator expression within the `list()` constructor to iterate over each string `sub` in `test_tuple`.
For each `sub`, it accesses the last character using `sub[len(sub) - 1]` and adds it to the list `res`.
The last characters of the strings 'Mers', 'for', and 'Vers' are 's', 'r', and 's' respectively.
These characters are added to the list `res` in the same order.
Finally, the function returns the list `res` which contains the last characters of each string in the input tuple.
<<<Output>>>
['s', 'r', 's']
