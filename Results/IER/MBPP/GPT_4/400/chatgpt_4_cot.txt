<<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_freq` takes a list of tuples `test_list` as its argument.
The list comprehension inside the `set` function iterates over each tuple `sub` in `test_list`.
For each tuple, it is sorted using `sorted(sub)`. This means that the order of elements in each tuple is made consistent (ascending order).
The sorted tuples are then converted into a tuple again using `tuple(sorted(sub))`.
The `set` function is used to remove any duplicate tuples, as sets cannot contain duplicates.
The length of the resulting set is calculated using `len()`, which gives the number of unique tuples in the original list when considering their sorted order.
For the input `[(3, 4), (1, 2), (4, 3), (5, 6)]`, the sorted tuples would be `[(3, 4), (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]`.
After converting to a set, we get `{(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)}`, which has a length of 3.
Therefore, the function returns 3.
