<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 18.
The function sumofFactors checks if n is odd by checking if n % 2 != 0. Since 18 is even, it proceeds.
The variable res is initialized to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of the sums of the factors.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive). The square root of 18 is approximately 4.24, so the loop will consider numbers 2, 3, and 4.
For each number i in this range, the code initializes count to 0, curr_sum to 1, and curr_term to 1.
While n is divisible by i, it increments count, divides n by i, and updates curr_term and curr_sum accordingly.
For i = 2, count will be incremented to 1, n will be updated to 9, curr_sum will be set to 0 because i is 2 and count is 1, and curr_term will be 2. The while loop will break because 9 is not divisible by 2.
res is updated to res * curr_sum, which is 1 * 0 = 0.
For i = 3, count will be incremented twice, n will be updated to 1, curr_term will be 9, and curr_sum will be 13 (1 + 3 + 9). The while loop will break because 1 is not divisible by 3.
res is updated to res * curr_sum, which is 0 * 13 = 0.
The loop ends as there are no more numbers up to the square root of the original n (18) to consider.
Since n is now 1, the if condition (n >= 2) is not satisfied, and the final value of res remains 0.
The function returns res, which is 0.
