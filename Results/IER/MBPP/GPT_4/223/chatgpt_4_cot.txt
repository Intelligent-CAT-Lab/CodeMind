<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_majority` is designed to check if the element `x` appears more than `n//2` times in the sorted array `arr` of size `n`.

The array `arr` is initialized to `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10]`, `n` is initialized to `7`, and `x` is initialized to `3`.

The function `is_majority` calls `binary_search` to find the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `arr`.

The `binary_search` function is a recursive function that searches for `x` in `arr`. It starts with `low` set to `0` and `high` set to `n-1` which is `6`.

The first call to `binary_search` calculates `mid` as `(0 + 6)//2` which is `3`. Since `arr[3]` is `3` and `mid` is not `0`, it checks if `arr[mid-1]` is less than `x`. Since `arr[2]` is `3`, which is not less than `x`, it calls `binary_search` again with `low` set to `0` and `high` set to `mid - 1` which is `2`.

The second call to `binary_search` calculates `mid` as `(0 + 2)//2` which is `1`. Since `arr[1]` is `2` and `2` is less than `x`, it calls `binary_search` again with `low` set to `mid + 1` which is `2` and `high` still set to `2`.

The third call to `binary_search` calculates `mid` as `(2 + 2)//2` which is `2`. Since `arr[2]` is `3` and `mid` is not `0`, it checks if `arr[mid-1]` is less than `x`. Since `arr[1]` is `2`, which is less than `x`, and `arr[mid]` is `x`, it returns `mid` which is `2`.

Back in the `is_majority` function, `i` is now `2`. It checks if `i + n//2` is less than or equal to `n - 1` and if `arr[i + n//2]` is `x`. Since `n//2` is `3`, `i + n//2` is `5`, which is less than `n - 1` which is `6`. Also, `arr[5]` is `3`, which is equal to `x`.

Since both conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`.
