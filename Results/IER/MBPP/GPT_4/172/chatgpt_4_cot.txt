The function `count_occurance` is designed to count the occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string `s`.
The input string `s` is initialized to "letstdlenstdporstd".
The variable `count` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of occurrences of 'std'.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of `s` minus 2 (because we are checking for a sequence of 3 characters, and we want to avoid an index out of range error).
For each index `i` in this range, the code checks if the substring starting at index `i` and spanning 3 characters is 'std'.
The condition is met when `i` is 3, 9, and 15, corresponding to the occurrences of 'std' in the input string.
Each time the condition is met, `count` is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `count`, which is 3.
