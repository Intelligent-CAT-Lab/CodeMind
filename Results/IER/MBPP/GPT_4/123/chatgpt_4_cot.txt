<<<Analysis>>>
The function `amicable_numbers_sum` is designed to calculate the sum of all amicable numbers up to a given limit. An amicable pair consists of two numbers where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other. The function takes one argument, `limit`, which is set to 999 in this case.

1. The function first checks if the input `limit` is an integer and greater than 0. Since 999 is an integer and greater than 0, the function proceeds.
2. An empty set `amicables` is created to store the amicable numbers found.
3. A loop starts from 2 up to and including `limit` (999 in this case).
4. For each number `num` in this range, the function checks if `num` is already in the set `amicables`. If it is, the loop continues to the next iteration.
5. If `num` is not in `amicables`, the function calculates the sum of proper divisors of `num` and stores it in `sum_fact`.
6. Then, it calculates the sum of proper divisors of `sum_fact` and stores it in `sum_fact2`.
7. If `num` is equal to `sum_fact2` and `num` is not equal to `sum_fact`, it means that `num` and `sum_fact` are an amicable pair. Both numbers are added to the set `amicables`.
8. After the loop finishes, the function returns the sum of all numbers in the set `amicables`.

To find the amicable numbers up to 999, the function will identify the following known amicable pairs within the range: (220, 284), (1184, 1210), and (2620, 2924). However, since the limit is 999, only the pair (220, 284) is within the range.

The sum of the amicable numbers up to 999 is therefore 220 + 284 = 504.
