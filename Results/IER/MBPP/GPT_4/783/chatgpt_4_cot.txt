<<<Analysis>>>
The function `rgb_to_hsv` converts an RGB color value to HSV. The input parameters r, g, and b are set to 255, 255, and 255, respectively.

1. The RGB values are first normalized by dividing by 255.0, so r, g, and b all become 1.0.
2. The maximum value `mx` among r, g, and b is determined, which is 1.0.
3. The minimum value `mn` among r, g, and b is determined, which is also 1.0.
4. The difference `df` between `mx` and `mn` is calculated, which is 0.
5. The hue `h` is calculated. Since `mx` equals `mn`, `h` is set to 0.
6. The saturation `s` is calculated. Since `mx` is 0, `s` is set to 0. (Note: This is actually a mistake in the code logic because `mx` is 1.0, not 0. However, since `df` is 0, `s` would still be 0 because `df/mx` would be 0.)
7. The value `v` is calculated by multiplying `mx` by 100, which results in 100.
8. The function returns the tuple (h, s, v), which is (0, 0, 100) in this case.

<<<Output>>>
(0, 0, 100)
