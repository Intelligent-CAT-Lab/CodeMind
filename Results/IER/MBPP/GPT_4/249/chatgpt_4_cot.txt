<<<Analysis>>>
The function `intersection_array` takes two lists as input: `array_nums1` and `array_nums2`.
The function uses the `filter` function with a lambda expression to filter out the elements in `array_nums2` that are also present in `array_nums1`.
The lambda function checks for each element `x` in `array_nums2` if `x` is contained in `array_nums1`.
The `filter` function returns an iterator that contains only the elements that satisfy the lambda condition.
The `list` function is used to convert the iterator into a list.
The input lists are `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]` and `[1, 2, 4, 8, 9]`.
The elements that are present in both lists are 1, 2, 8, and 9.
The result list containing the intersection of the two arrays is `[1, 2, 8, 9]`.
The function returns this list as the result.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 8, 9]
