<<<Analysis>>>
The function `removezero_ip` takes a string `ip` as an input, which is "216.08.094.196" in this case.
The function uses the `re.sub` method from the `re` (regular expression) module to replace occurrences in the string.
The pattern `'\.[0]*'` is used to match a period followed by any number of zeros.
The replacement string is `'.'`, which means that the matched pattern will be replaced with a single period.
The regular expression pattern will match ".08", ".094", and ".0" in the input string.
The function will replace these matches with a single period, resulting in the string "216.8.94.196".
The modified string is then returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
"216.8.94.196"
