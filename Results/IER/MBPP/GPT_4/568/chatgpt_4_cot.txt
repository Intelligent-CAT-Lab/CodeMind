<<<Analysis>>>
The function `empty_list` is defined with one parameter `length`.
When the function is called with the argument `5`, the variable `length` is initialized to 5.
Inside the function, a list comprehension is used to create a list of empty dictionaries. The list comprehension iterates `_` (a throwaway variable) over the range of `length` (which is 5).
For each iteration, an empty dictionary `{}` is created and added to the list.
Since the range is from 0 to 4 (5 iterations), the list will contain 5 empty dictionaries.
The function then returns this list of empty dictionaries.
