<<<Analysis>>>
The function `multiply_elements` takes a single tuple `test_tup` as an argument.
The tuple `test_tup` is initialized to (1, 5, 7, 8, 10).
The function uses a generator expression to create a new tuple `res`.
The generator expression multiplies each element `i` of `test_tup` with the next element `j` in the tuple. This is done by using the `zip` function to pair each element with the next one (excluding the last element because there is no next element for it).
The multiplication is performed as follows:
- 1 * 5 = 5
- 5 * 7 = 35
- 7 * 8 = 56
- 8 * 10 = 80
The result of these multiplications is stored in the tuple `res`.
The function returns the tuple `res`, which contains the products of the multiplications.
<<<Output>>>
(5, 35, 56, 80)
