The function `pack_consecutive_duplicates` takes a list `list1` as an argument.
The function uses the `groupby` function from the `itertools` module to group consecutive duplicate elements in the list.
The `groupby` function iterates over `list1` and groups consecutive elements that are the same into sub-iterators (`group`).
The list comprehension `[list(group) for key, group in groupby(list1)]` converts these sub-iterators into lists and collects them into a list of lists.
For the input `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]`, the `groupby` function will group the consecutive duplicates as follows:
- Two 0s together
- One 1 by itself
- One 2 by itself
- One 3 by itself
- Two 4s together
- One 5 by itself
- Three 6s together
- One 7 by itself
- One 8 by itself
- One 9 by itself
- Two 4s together
The function will then return a list of these groups as lists: `[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]`.
