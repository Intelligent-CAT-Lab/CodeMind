<<<Analysis>>>
The function _sum is defined to take a single argument, which is expected to be a list of numbers.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the numbers in the list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in the array arr.
For each element i in the array, it adds the value of i to the sum.
The array provided as input is [1, 2, 3].
The loop will perform the following operations:
- First iteration: sum = 0 + 1 = 1
- Second iteration: sum = 1 + 2 = 3
- Third iteration: sum = 3 + 3 = 6
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of sum, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
