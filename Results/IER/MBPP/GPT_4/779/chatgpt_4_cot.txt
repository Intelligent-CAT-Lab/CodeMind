<<<Analysis>>>
The function `unique_sublists` takes a list of lists as input and returns a dictionary where each key is a tuple representing a unique sublist from the input, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that sublist appears in the input.

The input list is `[[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [13, 15, 17], [5, 7], [9, 11]]`.

The variable `result` is initialized as an empty dictionary.

The function then iterates over each sublist `l` in the input list `list1`.

For each sublist `l`, the function uses `setdefault` to add a key to the `result` dictionary that is a tuple of the sublist. If the key already exists, `setdefault` does nothing. It then appends the value `1` to the list associated with that key.

After the first loop, the `result` dictionary looks like this:
{
    (1, 3): [1, 1],
    (5, 7): [1, 1],
    (13, 15, 17): [1],
    (9, 11): [1]
}

The function then iterates over the items in the `result` dictionary. For each key-value pair `(a, b)`, it sums the list `b` and assigns this sum back to `result[a]`. This sum represents the count of how many times the sublist represented by `a` appeared in the input list.

After the second loop, the `result` dictionary looks like this:
{
    (1, 3): 2,
    (5, 7): 2,
    (13, 15, 17): 1,
    (9, 11): 1
}

This dictionary is then returned as the output of the function.
