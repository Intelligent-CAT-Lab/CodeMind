The function `extract_index_list` takes three lists as input: l1, l2, and l3.
The lists provided as input are `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]`, and `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]`.
An empty list `result` is initialized to store the matching elements.
The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the three lists simultaneously. The `zip` function pairs up the elements from each list into tuples, so the loop will iterate over tuples of elements `(m, n, o)` where `m` is from l1, `n` is from l2, and `o` is from l3.
For each tuple `(m, n, o)`, the function checks if all three elements are equal (`m == n == o`). If they are, the element `m` is appended to the `result` list.
The loop will process the following tuples: `(1, 0, 0)`, `(1, 1, 1)`, `(3, 2, 2)`, `(4, 3, 3)`, `(5, 4, 4)`, `(6, 5, 5)`, `(7, 7, 7)`.
Only the tuples `(1, 1, 1)` and `(7, 7, 7)` have all elements equal, so `1` and `7` will be appended to the `result` list.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the `result` list, which contains `[1, 7]`.
