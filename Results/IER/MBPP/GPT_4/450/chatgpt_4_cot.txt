<<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_string` takes two parameters: a list of strings `str` and an integer `l` which represents the desired length of strings to be extracted from the list.
The list `str` is initialized to `['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution']` and `l` is initialized to 8.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `e` in the list `str`.
For each element `e`, it checks if the length of `e` is equal to `l` (which is 8 in this case).
If the length of `e` is 8, it is included in the resulting list.
The elements 'exercises' and 'practice' have a length of 9 and 8 respectively. Only 'practice' meets the condition of having a length of 8.
The resulting list, therefore, contains only the string 'practice'.
The function returns this list.

['practice']
