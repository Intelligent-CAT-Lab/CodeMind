The function `newman_prime` is a recursive function that calculates a value based on the previous two values in the sequence. The base cases are when n is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1.

Let's calculate `newman_prime(3)` step by step:

1. `newman_prime(3)` calls `newman_prime(2)` and `newman_prime(1)`.
2. To calculate `newman_prime(2)`, it calls `newman_prime(1)` and `newman_prime(0)`.
3. Since `newman_prime(1)` and `newman_prime(0)` are base cases, they both return 1.
4. Now we can calculate `newman_prime(2)` as `2 * newman_prime(1) + newman_prime(0)`, which is `2 * 1 + 1 = 3`.
5. We already know `newman_prime(1)` is 1 from the base case.
6. Now we can calculate `newman_prime(3)` as `2 * newman_prime(2) + newman_prime(1)`, which is `2 * 3 + 1 = 7`.

Therefore, the return value of `newman_prime(3)` is 7.
