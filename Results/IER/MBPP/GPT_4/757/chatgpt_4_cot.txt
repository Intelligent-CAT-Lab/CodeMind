The function `count_reverse_pairs` takes a list of strings as input and returns the count of pairs of strings where one is the reverse of the other.

The input list is `["julia", "best", "tseb", "for", "ailuj"]`.

The function uses a list comprehension with two nested loops to iterate over all possible pairs of strings in the list. The outer loop variable `idx` goes from 0 to the length of the list, and the inner loop variable `idxn` goes from `idx` to the length of the list. This ensures that each pair is only considered once.

For each pair of strings, the function checks if the second string (`test_list[idxn]`) is equal to the reverse of the first string (`test_list[idx]`). The reverse of the string is obtained by converting the string to a list, reversing the list, and then joining it back into a string.

The list comprehension creates a list of 1s for each pair that meets the condition (i.e., one string is the reverse of the other).

The `sum` function is then used to sum up the 1s, which gives the total count of reverse pairs.

In the given list, there are two pairs that meet the condition:
- "best" and "tseb"
- "julia" and "ailuj"

Therefore, the function will return the count of these pairs, which is 2.
