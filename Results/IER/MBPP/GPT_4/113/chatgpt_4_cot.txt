<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to the string "python".
The text is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, but since there is none, it remains "python".
The length of the text is checked to be greater than 0, which is true since "python" has 6 characters.
The code then checks if all characters in the text are digits, which is not the case for "python".
Since the first condition fails, the code checks the second condition, which is whether the first character is "+" or "-" and the rest are digits. This condition also fails because the first character is "p", not "+" or "-".
Since neither condition is met, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
