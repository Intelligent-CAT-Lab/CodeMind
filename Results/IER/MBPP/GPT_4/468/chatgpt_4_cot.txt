<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_product` is designed to find the maximum product of a contiguous subarray within the given array `arr`.

The input array is `[3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]`.

1. The length of the array `n` is 6.
2. A copy of the array `arr` is created and stored in `mpis`. Initially, `mpis` is `[3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]`.
3. The function enters a loop that iterates over each element of the array.
4. For each element at index `i`, it initializes `current_prod` to the value of `arr[i]`.
5. It then enters a nested loop starting from the next element `j = i + 1`.
6. If the previous element `arr[j-1]` is greater than the current element `arr[j]`, the loop breaks.
7. Otherwise, it multiplies `current_prod` by `arr[j]`.
8. If `current_prod` is greater than `mpis[j]`, it updates `mpis[j]` with `current_prod`.
9. The loop continues until it breaks or reaches the end of the array.

Let's go through the iterations:
- For `i = 0`, `arr[i] = 3`. The inner loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = 5` and breaks at `j = 2` because `arr[1] > arr[2]`. The `mpis` array is not updated.
- For `i = 1`, `arr[i] = 100`. The inner loop runs from `j = 2` to `j = 5` and breaks at `j = 5` because `arr[4] > arr[5]`. The `mpis` array is updated to `[3, 100, 400, 2000, 30000, 6]`.
- For `i = 2`, `arr[i] = 4`. The inner loop runs from `j = 3` to `j = 5` and breaks at `j = 5` because `arr[4] > arr[5]`. The `mpis` array is updated to `[3, 100, 400, 2000, 30000, 6]` (no change).
- For `i = 3`, `arr[i] = 5`. The inner loop runs from `j = 4` to `j = 5` and breaks at `j = 5` because `arr[4] > arr[5]`. The `mpis` array is updated to `[3, 100, 400, 2000, 30000, 6]` (no change).
- For `i = 4`, `arr[i] = 150`. The inner loop runs only for `j = 5` and does not break. The `mpis` array is updated to `[3, 100, 400, 2000, 30000, 900]`.
- For `i = 5`, `arr[i] = 6`. There is no inner loop because `j` would start at 6, which is not less than `n`.

10. Finally, the function returns the maximum value in `mpis`, which is `30000`.
