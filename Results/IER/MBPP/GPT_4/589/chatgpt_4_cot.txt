<<<Analysis>>>
The function `perfect_squares` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are initialized to 1 and 30, respectively.
An empty list `lists` is created to store the perfect squares found within the range [a, b].
The code enters a loop that iterates from `a` to `b` (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 30.
For each number `i` in this range, it initializes a variable `j` to 1 and enters a while loop.
The while loop checks if `j*j` is less than or equal to `i`. If it is, it then checks if `j*j` is equal to `i`.
If `j*j` is equal to `i`, it means `i` is a perfect square, and `i` is appended to the list `lists`.
The variable `j` is then incremented by 1, and the while loop continues until `j*j` is greater than `i`.
The for loop then moves to the next number, and the process repeats.
The perfect squares between 1 and 30 are 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the list `lists`, which contains the perfect squares found.

[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
