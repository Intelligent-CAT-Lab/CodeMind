<<<Analysis>>>
The function `last_Digit_Factorial` is designed to return the last digit of the factorial of a given number n.
The function checks the value of n against several conditions:
- If n is 0, it returns 1, because the factorial of 0 is 1.
- If n is less than or equal to 2, it returns n itself, because the factorial of 1 is 1 and the factorial of 2 is 2.
- If n is 3, it returns 6, because the factorial of 3 is 6.
- If n is 4, it returns 4, because the factorial of 4 is 24, and the last digit is 4.
- For any other value of n (n > 4), it returns 0, because the last digit of the factorial of any number greater than 4 is always 0 (due to the multiplication by 10 which comes from the factorial of 5).

Since the input to the function is 4, the corresponding condition is met (elif n == 4), and the function returns 4.
