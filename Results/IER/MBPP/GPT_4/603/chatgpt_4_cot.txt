<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_ludic` is designed to generate a list of ludic numbers up to a given number n. Here's how the code works:

1. Initialize an empty list `ludics`.
2. Fill the list with numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).
3. Start with the second element in the list (index 1, which is the number 2) as the first ludic number after 1.
4. Enter a while loop that continues as long as the current index is less than the length of the list.
5. Get the value of the first ludic number after 1, which is at the current index.
6. Calculate the index of the number to remove by adding the value of the first ludic number to the current index.
7. Enter another while loop to remove every nth number from the list, where n is the value of the first ludic number after 1.
8. Increment the index to move to the next ludic number in the list.
9. Repeat the process until the end of the list is reached.
10. Return the final list of ludic numbers.

Let's apply this process to `get_ludic(10)`:

- Start with the list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
- The first ludic number after 1 is 2 (at index 1).
- Remove every 2nd number after 2: remove 4, 6, 8, 10.
- The list is now: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
- The next ludic number is 3 (at index 2).
- Remove every 3rd number after 3: remove 7.
- The list is now: [1, 2, 3, 5, 9]
- The next ludic number is 5 (at index 3).
- There are no numbers to remove since 5 is the last number in the list.
- The list is now: [1, 2, 3, 5, 9]
- The next ludic number is 9 (at index 4), but there are no more numbers to remove.
- The final list of ludic numbers up to 10 is [1, 2, 3, 5, 9].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 5, 9]
