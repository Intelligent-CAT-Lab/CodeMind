<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_Char` takes a string `strr` as input and initializes a variable `summ` to 0.
It then iterates over each character in the string, converting each character to its corresponding alphabetical index (where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, etc.) by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the character and adding 1.
For the input "abc", the alphabetical indices are 1 for 'a', 2 for 'b', and 3 for 'c'. The sum of these indices is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
The function then checks if `summ` modulo 26 is 0. In this case, 6 % 26 is not 0, so it proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, it calculates `summ` modulo 26, which is still 6 since 6 is less than 26.
It then returns the character corresponding to the alphabetical index 6, which is 'f' (since 'a' is the first letter and 'f' is the sixth letter in the alphabet).
<<<Output>>>
'f'
