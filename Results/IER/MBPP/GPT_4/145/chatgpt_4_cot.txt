<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_Abs_Diff` takes an array `arr` as input.
The length of the array `arr` is determined and stored in variable `n`, which is 4 for the input array (2,1,5,3).
The variables `minEle` and `maxEle` are initialized to the first element of the array, which is 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the second element to the last element of the array.
For each element `arr[i]` in the array, the code updates `minEle` to the minimum of `minEle` and `arr[i]`, and `maxEle` to the maximum of `maxEle` and `arr[i]`.
After the loop, `minEle` is the minimum element in the array, which is 1, and `maxEle` is the maximum element in the array, which is 5.
The function returns the difference between `maxEle` and `minEle`, which is 5 - 1 = 4.
