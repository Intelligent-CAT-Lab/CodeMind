<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_charac` is designed to count the number of characters in a given string `str1`.
The input string `str1` is initialized to "python programming".
The variable `total` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of characters.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string "python programming".
For each iteration, the code increments the `total` by 1.
The loop runs for each character in the string, including spaces. The string "python programming" has 18 characters in total (including the space).
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `total`, which is 18.
<<<Output>>>
18
