The function `frequency_lists` takes a list of lists as an input and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each element in the sublists.

1. The input list of lists `[[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]]` is flattened into a single list `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 7, 8, 9, 5]` using a list comprehension.

2. An empty dictionary `dic_data` is created to store the frequency of each number.

3. The code then iterates over each number in the flattened list.

4. For each number, it checks if the number is already a key in the dictionary `dic_data`. If it is, it increments the value associated with that key by 1.

5. If the number is not already a key in the dictionary, it adds the number as a key with the value 1.

6. After iterating through all numbers, the dictionary `dic_data` contains the frequency of each number in the input list of lists.

7. The function returns the dictionary `dic_data`.

For the given input `[[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]]`, the function will process the numbers as follows:

- The number 1 appears once.
- The number 2 appears three times.
- The number 3 appears once.
- The number 4 appears once.
- The number 5 appears twice.
- The number 6 appears once.
- The number 7 appears once.
- The number 8 appears once.
- The number 9 appears once.

The resulting dictionary will be `{1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}`.

{1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}
