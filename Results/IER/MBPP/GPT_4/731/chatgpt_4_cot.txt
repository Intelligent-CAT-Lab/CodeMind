<<<Analysis>>>
The function `lateralsurface_cone` takes two arguments, `r` and `h`, which represent the radius and height of a cone, respectively. In this case, `r` is 5 and `h` is 12.
The variable `l` is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of `r` and `h`. This represents the slant height of the cone. Using the Pythagorean theorem, `l` is calculated as `sqrt(5^2 + 12^2)`, which is `sqrt(25 + 144)`, or `sqrt(169)`. The result is `13`.
The lateral surface area (LSA) of the cone is then calculated using the formula `π * r * l`. Substituting the known values, we get `π * 5 * 13`.
The value of `π` is taken from the `math` module, which is approximately `3.14159`.
Multiplying these together, we get `3.14159 * 5 * 13`, which is approximately `204.2035`.
The function returns the value of `LSA`, which is the lateral surface area of the cone.
