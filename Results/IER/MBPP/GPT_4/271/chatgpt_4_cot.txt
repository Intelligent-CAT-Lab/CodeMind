<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the fifth powers of even numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers 1 and 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates j as 2*i, which will be the even numbers 2 and 4 for i equal to 1 and 2, respectively.
Then, it calculates the fifth power of j (j^5) and adds it to sum.
For i = 1, j = 2, j^5 = 32, and sum becomes 32.
For i = 2, j = 4, j^5 = 1024, and sum becomes 32 + 1024 = 1056.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum, which is 1056.
<<<Output>>>
1056
