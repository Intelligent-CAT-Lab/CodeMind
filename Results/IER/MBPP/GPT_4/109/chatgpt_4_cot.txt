<<<Analysis>>>
The function `odd_Equivalent` takes two arguments: a string `s` and an integer `n`.
The string `s` is "011001", and `n` is 6, indicating the length of the string.
The variable `count` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the occurrences of '1' in the string.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all characters in the string "011001".
For each character `s[i]` in the string, the code checks if it is equal to '1'.
If the character is '1', the `count` is incremented by 1.
The loop processes each character in the string "011001" and increments `count` when a '1' is found.
The characters at positions 1, 3, and 5 (0-indexed) are '1', so `count` is incremented three times.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `count`, which is 3.
