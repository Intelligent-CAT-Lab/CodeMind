<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_polite` takes an integer n as input. In this case, n is initialized to 7.
The first operation inside the function is to increment n by 1, so n becomes 8.
Next, the function calculates the logarithm of n to the base 2, which is math.log(8, 2). Since 8 is 2 to the power of 3, the logarithm is 3.
Then, it adds n (which is now 8) to the logarithm of n (which is 3), resulting in 11.
Now, the function calculates the logarithm of the sum (11) to the base 2, which is math.log(11, 2). The logarithm of 11 to the base 2 is approximately 3.4594.
The function then adds n (which is now 8) to the result of the second logarithm (approximately 3.4594), resulting in approximately 11.4594.
Finally, the function casts the result to an integer using (int), which truncates the decimal part and returns 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
