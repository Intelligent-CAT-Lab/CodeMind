<<<Analysis>>>
The function `expensive_items` is defined with two parameters: `items`, which is expected to be a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents an item with a 'name' and a 'price', and `n`, which represents the number of expensive items to return.

The function uses the `heapq.nlargest` function to get the `n` largest elements from the `items` list based on the 'price' key. The `key` parameter is set to a lambda function that takes an item (a dictionary) and returns the value associated with the 'price' key.

The input to the function is a list of two items, each represented by a dictionary with 'name' and 'price' keys, and the number `n` is set to 1, which means we want to get the single most expensive item.

The `heapq.nlargest` function will compare the 'price' values of the two items: 101.1 for 'Item-1' and 555.22 for 'Item-2'. Since 'Item-2' has a higher price, it will be selected as the most expensive item.

The function will return a list containing only the dictionary for 'Item-2', as it is the most expensive item and we requested only the top 1 item.

<<<Output>>>
[{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}]
