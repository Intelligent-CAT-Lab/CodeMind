The function `find_length` is designed to find the length of the longest contiguous substring containing more '0's than '1's in the given binary string.

The variable `string` is initialized to "11000010001".
The variable `n` is set to the length of `string`, which is 11.
`current_sum` and `max_sum` are initialized to 0.

The code enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string.
For each character, `current_sum` is incremented by 1 if the character is '0' and decremented by 1 if the character is '1'.
If `current_sum` becomes negative, it is reset to 0 because a valid substring cannot start with more '1's than '0's.
`max_sum` is updated to be the maximum of `current_sum` and the current `max_sum`.

The loop processes the string as follows:
- i=0, string[i]='1', current_sum=-1 (reset to 0), max_sum=0
- i=1, string[i]='1', current_sum=-1 (reset to 0), max_sum=0
- i=2, string[i]='0', current_sum=1, max_sum=1
- i=3, string[i]='0', current_sum=2, max_sum=2
- i=4, string[i]='0', current_sum=3, max_sum=3
- i=5, string[i]='0', current_sum=4, max_sum=4
- i=6, string[i]='0', current_sum=5, max_sum=5
- i=7, string[i]='1', current_sum=4, max_sum=5
- i=8, string[i]='0', current_sum=5, max_sum=5
- i=9, string[i]='0', current_sum=6, max_sum=6
- i=10, string[i]='1', current_sum=5, max_sum=6

After the loop finishes, the function returns `max_sum` which is the length of the longest contiguous substring with more '0's than '1's. In this case, the longest such substring is "0000010000" which has a length of 6.

Therefore, the return value of `find_length("11000010001")` is 6.
