<<<Analysis>>>
The function `first_non_repeating_character` is designed to find the first character in a string that does not repeat.

1. The input string "abcabc" is passed to the function.
2. Two data structures are initialized: `char_order` (a list) to keep track of the order in which characters appear, and `ctr` (a dictionary) to count the occurrences of each character.
3. The function iterates over each character `c` in the string "abcabc".
4. For each character, the function checks if it is already in the `ctr` dictionary:
   - If it is, the function increments the count for that character.
   - If it is not, the function sets the count to 1 and appends the character to the `char_order` list.
5. After the first loop, `ctr` will have the counts of each character: {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 2}, and `char_order` will have the characters in the order they appeared: ['a', 'b', 'c'].
6. The function then iterates over the `char_order` list to find the first character with a count of 1 in `ctr`.
7. Since all characters in the string "abcabc" repeat, none of them have a count of 1 in `ctr`.
8. As a result, the function will not return any character from the `char_order` list and will proceed to return `None`.
