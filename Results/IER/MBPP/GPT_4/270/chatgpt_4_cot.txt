<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_even_and_even_index` takes an array `arr` as input.
The array provided as input is `[5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8]`.
The variable `sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of even numbers at even indices.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the array with a step of 2, meaning it will consider elements at indices 0, 2, 4, and so on (0-based indexing).
For each element at an even index, the code checks if the element is even by using the condition `(arr[i] % 2 == 0)`.
If the element is even, it is added to the `sum`.
The elements at even indices are 5, 12, and 18.
Out of these, 12 and 18 are even numbers.
The sum of these even numbers is 12 + 18 = 30.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `sum`, which is 30.
<<<Output>>>
30
