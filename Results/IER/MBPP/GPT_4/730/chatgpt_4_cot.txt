<<<Analysis>>>
The function `consecutive_duplicates` takes a list of numbers as input and uses the `groupby` function from the `itertools` module to group consecutive duplicates together.
The input list is `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]`.
The `groupby` function will iterate over the list and group consecutive identical elements together.
The list comprehension `[key for key, group in groupby(nums)]` will then create a new list containing only the keys (the unique values) from each group of consecutive duplicates.
The consecutive duplicates in the input list are `0, 0`, `4, 4`, `6, 6, 6`, and `4, 4`. These will be reduced to a single instance of each number in the output list.
The final output list will be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]`, where each number appears only once in a sequence of consecutive duplicates.

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]
