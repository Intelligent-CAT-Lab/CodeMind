<<<Analysis>>>
The function `freq_count` takes a list as an input and uses the `collections.Counter` class to count the frequency of each element in the list.
The input list is `[10,10,10,10,20,20,20,20,40,40,50,50,30]`.
The `Counter` class will create a dictionary-like object where the keys are the unique elements from the list and the values are the counts of those elements.
The counts for each element in the input list are as follows:
- 10 appears 4 times
- 20 appears 4 times
- 40 appears 2 times
- 50 appears 2 times
- 30 appears 1 time
The `Counter` object will thus be `Counter({10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1})`.
The function returns this `Counter` object.
<<<Output>>>
Counter({10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1})
