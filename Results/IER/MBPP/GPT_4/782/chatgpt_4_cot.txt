The function `odd_length_sum` takes a list `arr` as input and calculates a sum based on the elements of the list and their positions.

The input list is `[1, 2, 4]`, and its length `l` is 3.

The function iterates over the indices of the list (0 to 2) and for each index `i`, it performs the following calculation:
- It calculates the number of subarrays that include the element at index `i` which have an odd length. This is done by the expression `(((i + 1) * (l - i) + 1) // 2)`.
- It then multiplies this number by the value of the element at index `i` and adds the result to the running total `Sum`.

Let's calculate the sum step by step:

For `i = 0` (first element):
- The number of odd-length subarrays that include the first element is `(((0 + 1) * (3 - 0) + 1) // 2) = (1 * 3 + 1) // 2 = 4 // 2 = 2`.
- The value of the first element is `1`.
- The contribution to the sum is `2 * 1 = 2`.

For `i = 1` (second element):
- The number of odd-length subarrays that include the second element is `(((1 + 1) * (3 - 1) + 1) // 2) = (2 * 2 + 1) // 2 = 5 // 2 = 2`.
- The value of the second element is `2`.
- The contribution to the sum is `2 * 2 = 4`.

For `i = 2` (third element):
- The number of odd-length subarrays that include the third element is `(((2 + 1) * (3 - 2) + 1) // 2) = (3 * 1 + 1) // 2 = 4 // 2 = 2`.
- The value of the third element is `4`.
- The contribution to the sum is `2 * 4 = 8`.

The total sum is `2 + 4 + 8 = 14`.

Therefore, the return value of `odd_length_sum([1, 2, 4])` is 14.
