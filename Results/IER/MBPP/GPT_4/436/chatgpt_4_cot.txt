<<<Analysis>>>
The function `neg_nos` takes a list `list1` as an argument.
The list `list1` is initialized to `[-1, 4, 5, -6]`.
An empty list `out` is created to store the negative numbers.
The function enters a loop that iterates over each number in `list1`.
For each number, it checks if the number is less than 0 (negative).
If the number is negative, it is appended to the `out` list.
The numbers -1 and -6 from `list1` are negative and thus appended to `out`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the `out` list, which contains all the negative numbers from `list1`.
The final `out` list is `[-1, -6]`.
<<<Output>>>
[-1, -6]
