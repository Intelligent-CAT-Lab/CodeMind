The function `max_sum_increasing_subseq` is designed to calculate the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence in an array `a` of length `n`, given a specific `index` and `k`. The function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.

The input array `a` is `[1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5]`, and the length `n` is `7`. The specific `index` and `k` are `4` and `6`, respectively.

The function initializes a 2D array `dp` of size `n x n` with all elements set to `0`.

The first loop initializes the first row of `dp`. For each element `a[i]` that is greater than `a[0]`, it sets `dp[0][i]` to `a[i] + a[0]`. Otherwise, it sets `dp[0][i]` to `a[i]`. After this loop, the first row of `dp` will be `[1, 102, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5]`.

The second nested loop fills in the rest of the `dp` table. It checks if `a[j]` is greater than `a[i]` and if `j` is greater than `i`. If both conditions are met, it compares `dp[i - 1][i] + a[j]` with `dp[i - 1][j]` and assigns the maximum to `dp[i][j]`. Otherwise, it just carries over the value from the previous row `dp[i - 1][j]`.

After filling the `dp` table, the function returns the value at `dp[index][k]`, which corresponds to the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence ending at index `k` and considering elements up to index `index`.

Let's fill the `dp` table step by step:

- For `i = 1`, the row will be `[1, 102, 3, 4, 100, 5, 6]` because `a[1]` is 101 and greater than all previous elements.
- For `i = 2`, the row will be `[1, 102, 3, 5, 100, 6, 7]` because `a[2]` is 2 and only greater than `a[0]`.
- For `i = 3`, the row will be `[1, 102, 3, 5, 100, 7, 8]` because `a[3]` is 3 and greater than `a[0]` and `a[2]`.
- For `i = 4`, the row will be `[1, 102, 3, 5, 100, 104, 105]` because `a[4]` is 100 and greater than all previous elements except `a[1]`.
- For `i = 5`, the row will be `[1, 102, 3, 5, 100, 104, 105]` because `a[5]` is 4 and does not lead to an increase over the previous maximum sums.
- For `i = 6`, the row will be `[1, 102, 3, 5, 100, 104, 105]` because `a[6]` is 5 and does not lead to an increase over the previous maximum sums.

The value at `dp[4][6]` is `105`, which is the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence considering elements up to index `4` and ending at index `6`.
