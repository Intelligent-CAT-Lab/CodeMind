<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_val` is defined to take one argument, `listval`.
The input to the function is the list `['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']`.
The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in `listval`.
The generator expression filters out non-integer elements by using `isinstance(i, int)`. This means only the elements 3, 2, 4, and 5 are considered because they are integers.
The `max` function is then used to find the maximum value among the filtered integers.
The maximum integer value in the list is 5.
The function returns this maximum value.
<<<Output>>>
5
