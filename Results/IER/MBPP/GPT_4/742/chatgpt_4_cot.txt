<<<Analysis>>>
The function `area_tetrahedron` takes one argument, `side`, which represents the length of a side of a regular tetrahedron.
The variable `side` is initialized to 3.
The function calculates the area of a regular tetrahedron using the formula `sqrt(3) * (side * side)`.
The `math.sqrt(3)` computes the square root of 3.
The expression `(side * side)` computes the square of the side length, which is `3 * 3 = 9`.
The area is then calculated as `math.sqrt(3) * 9`.
The square root of 3 is approximately 1.732.
Therefore, the area is approximately `1.732 * 9`, which equals approximately 15.588.
The function returns this area value.
<<<Output>>>
15.588
