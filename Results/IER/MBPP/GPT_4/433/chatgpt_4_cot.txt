<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_greater` takes two arguments: a list `arr` and a number `number`.
The list `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the number `number` is `4`.
The first operation in the function is to sort the list `arr`. Since the list is already in ascending order, the sorted list remains `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
The function then compares `number` to the last element of the sorted list `arr[-1]`, which is `5`.
The comparison checks if `4` is greater than `5`, which is not true.
Therefore, the function will return `False`.
