<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Extract` takes a list `lst` as an argument.
The list comprehension `[item[0] for item in lst]` iterates over each item in the list `lst`.
For each item, which is itself a list, the list comprehension extracts the first element of that list (index 0).
The input list is `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]`.
The first elements of the sublists are 1, 3, and 6, respectively.
The function returns a new list containing these first elements.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 6]
