<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add_nested_tuples` takes two tuples of tuples as arguments, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
The function initializes a variable `res` which will store the result of the addition of the corresponding elements of the nested tuples.
The function uses a nested tuple comprehension to iterate over the pairs of tuples from `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` simultaneously using `zip`.
For each pair of tuples `(tup1, tup2)`, it zips their elements together and adds them, creating a new tuple with the sums of the corresponding elements.
The outer tuple comprehension collects these new tuples into a single tuple, which is the result.
The input tuples are `((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10))` and `((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))`.
The function will process them as follows:
- The first elements of both tuples `(1, 3)` and `(6, 7)` are zipped and added to get `(7, 10)`.
- The second elements `(4, 5)` and `(3, 9)` are zipped and added to get `(7, 14)`.
- The third elements `(2, 9)` and `(1, 1)` are zipped and added to get `(3, 10)`.
- The fourth elements `(1, 10)` and `(7, 3)` are zipped and added to get `(8, 13)`.
The final result is a tuple of these new tuples: `((7, 10), (7, 14), (3, 10), (8, 13))`.

((7, 10), (7, 14), (3, 10), (8, 13))
