<<<Analysis>>>
The function `bell_Number(n)` is designed to calculate the nth Bell number. The Bell number represents the number of ways a set with n elements can be partitioned into non-empty subsets.

The variable `n` is initialized to 2.

A two-dimensional list `bell` is created with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1), and all elements are initialized to 0. This list will hold the Bell triangle values.

The first element `bell[0][0]` is set to 1, which is the base case for Bell numbers.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider rows 1 and 2 for `n = 2`.

For `i = 1`, the first element of the row `bell[1][0]` is set to `bell[0][0]`, which is 1.

Then, another loop starts for `j` from 1 to `i` (inclusive). Since `i` is 1, it only considers `j = 1`.

The value of `bell[1][1]` is set to `bell[0][0] + bell[1][0]`, which is 1 + 1 = 2.

For `i = 2`, the first element of the row `bell[2][0]` is set to `bell[1][1]`, which is 2.

The inner loop for `j` runs for `j = 1` and `j = 2`.

For `j = 1`, `bell[2][1]` is set to `bell[1][0] + bell[2][0]`, which is 1 + 2 = 3.

For `j = 2`, `bell[2][2]` is set to `bell[1][1] + bell[2][1]`, which is 2 + 3 = 5.

After the loops finish, the function returns `bell[n][0]`, which is `bell[2][0]` in this case, and the value is 2.
