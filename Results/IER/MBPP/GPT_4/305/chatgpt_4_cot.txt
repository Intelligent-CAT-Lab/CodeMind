<<<Analysis>>>
The function `start_withp` takes a list of words as input.
The input list is `["Python PHP", "Java JavaScript", "c c++"]`.
The function iterates over each word in the list.
The regular expression `(P\w+)\W(P\w+)` is used to match any word that starts with 'P' followed by any word characters, followed by a non-word character, and then followed by another word that starts with 'P' and is followed by any word characters.
The first word "Python PHP" matches the pattern:
- 'Python' matches `(P\w+)` because it starts with 'P' and is followed by word characters.
- ' ' (space) matches `\W` because it is a non-word character.
- 'PHP' matches `(P\w+)` because it starts with 'P' and is followed by word characters.
Since the first word matches the pattern, the function returns the tuple of matched groups, which are ('Python', 'PHP').
The function returns after finding the first match, so it does not continue to check "Java JavaScript" or "c c++".
<<<Output>>>
('Python', 'PHP')
