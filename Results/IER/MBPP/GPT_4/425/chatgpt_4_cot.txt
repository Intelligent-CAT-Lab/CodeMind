<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_element_in_list` takes two arguments: `list1`, which is a list of lists, and `x`, which is the element to be counted within the sublists of `list1`.
The variable `ctr` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the occurrences of `x` in the sublists.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of `list1`.
For each index `i`, the function checks if `x` is present in `list1[i]` using the `in` operator.
If `x` is found in `list1[i]`, `ctr` is incremented by 1.
The function is called with `list1` as `[[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 11], [1, 15, 7]]` and `x` as `1`.
The loop checks each sublist:
- `1` is in `[1, 3]`, so `ctr` becomes 1.
- `1` is not in `[5, 7]`, so `ctr` remains 1.
- `1` is in `[1, 11]`, so `ctr` becomes 2.
- `1` is in `[1, 15, 7]`, so `ctr` becomes 3.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `ctr`, which is 3.
