<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `number` is initialized to 10.
The variable `total` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers from 1 to `number`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `number` (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each value in this range, it adds the value to `total`. The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is 55.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the average by dividing `total` by `number`. The average of numbers from 1 to 10 is 55 / 10, which is 5.5.
The function returns a tuple containing `total` and `average`, which are 55 and 5.5, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
(55, 5.5)
