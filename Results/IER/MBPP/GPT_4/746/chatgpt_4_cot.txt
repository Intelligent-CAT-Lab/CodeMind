<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sector_area` takes two arguments: `r` which is the radius of the circle, and `a` which is the angle of the sector in degrees.
The radius `r` is set to 4, and the angle `a` is set to 45 degrees.
First, the function checks if the angle `a` is greater than 360 degrees. If it is, the function returns `None`. Since 45 is not greater than 360, the function proceeds to the next step.
The area of the full circle is calculated using the formula `math.pi * r**2`. With `r` being 4, the area of the full circle is `math.pi * 4**2`, which is `math.pi * 16`.
The area of the sector is then calculated by multiplying the area of the full circle by the fraction of the circle that the sector represents, which is `a/360`. Since `a` is 45, the fraction is `45/360`, which simplifies to `1/8`.
The final area of the sector is `math.pi * 16 * (1/8)`, which simplifies to `2 * math.pi`.
The function returns this value as the area of the sector.
<<<Output>>>
2 * math.pi
