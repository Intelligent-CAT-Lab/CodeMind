<<<Analysis>>>
The function `shell_sort` is called with the list `[12, 23, 4, 5, 3, 2, 12, 81, 56, 95]`.

1. The initial gap is calculated as half the length of the list, which is 10 // 2 = 5.
2. The outer while loop starts with gap = 5 and will continue until gap is greater than 0.
3. The first for loop starts with i = 5 and will iterate over the list from the 5th index to the end.
4. The inner while loop will compare the current item with the item 5 positions before it and swap them if the current item is smaller.
5. This process will continue, reducing the gap by half each time until the gap is 0.
6. The list is sorted in increasing gaps of 5, 2, and 1.

Let's simulate the sorting process:

Initial list: [12, 23, 4, 5, 3, 2, 12, 81, 56, 95]
Gap = 5:
- No swaps needed for the first iteration since there are no elements 5 positions before the 5th index.
- The list remains the same.

Gap = 2:
- Compare and swap elements with a gap of 2.
- After this step, the list will look like this: [4, 3, 2, 5, 12, 12, 23, 56, 81, 95]

Gap = 1:
- Compare and swap elements with a gap of 1 (normal insertion sort).
- After this step, the list will be fully sorted: [2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12, 23, 56, 81, 95]

7. The sorted list is returned.
