<<<Analysis>>>
The function `polar_rect` takes two arguments, x and y, which are initialized to 3 and 4, respectively.
The function creates a complex number `cn` from x and y using the `complex` function.
The complex number `cn` is then converted to its polar form using `cmath.polar`, which returns a tuple with the magnitude and the phase angle of the complex number.
For the complex number 3 + 4j, the magnitude is 5.0 (calculated as the square root of (3^2 + 4^2)) and the phase angle is approximately 0.9272952180016122 radians (calculated using the arctan of y/x).
The function then creates another complex number `cn1` using `cmath.rect`, which converts polar coordinates to rectangular form. It uses a magnitude of 2 and an angle of pi radians.
The rectangular form of a complex number with magnitude 2 and angle pi is -2 + 0j (since cos(pi) = -1 and sin(pi) = 0).
The function returns a tuple containing the polar form of the original complex number and the rectangular form of the complex number with magnitude 2 and angle pi.
<<<Output>>>
((5.0, 0.9272952180016122), (-2+0j))
