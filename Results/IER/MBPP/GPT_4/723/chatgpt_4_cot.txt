<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_same_pair` takes two lists `nums1` and `nums2` as input.
The `map` function is used with the `eq` function from the `operator` module and the two lists. The `eq` function compares the elements of the two lists at the same index and returns `True` if they are equal, otherwise `False`.
The `map` function applies the `eq` function to each pair of elements from the two lists and returns an iterator of the results.
The `sum` function is then used to sum up the iterator of boolean values, where `True` is treated as `1` and `False` is treated as `0`.
The comparison results for the given lists are as follows:
- `eq(1, 2)` returns `False`
- `eq(2, 2)` returns `True`
- `eq(3, 3)` returns `True`
- `eq(4, 1)` returns `False`
- `eq(5, 2)` returns `False`
- `eq(6, 6)` returns `True`
- `eq(7, 7)` returns `True`
- `eq(8, 9)` returns `False`
The sum of the results is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`, since there are four `True` values.
The function returns the sum, which is `4`.
