<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized to 13.
The function prime_num checks if num is greater than or equal to 1, which is true for 13.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to num//2, which is the integer division of 13 by 2, resulting in 6. So the loop will check for factors from 2 to 5.
The loop checks if 13 is divisible by any number from 2 to 5 without a remainder.
The first iteration checks if 13 % 2 equals 0, which it does not, so the condition is false.
The function immediately returns True after the first iteration because the else statement is inside the loop, which is a logical error in the code.
The function should not return True until the loop has completed without finding any factors, but due to the incorrect indentation, it returns True prematurely.
Therefore, the function will incorrectly return True on the first iteration of the loop.
<<<Output>>>
