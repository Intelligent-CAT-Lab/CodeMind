<<<Analysis>>>
The function `tuple_modulo` takes two tuples as arguments, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
The function calculates the modulo of corresponding elements from `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` using a generator expression within a tuple constructor.
The `zip` function is used to pair elements from both tuples based on their index.
The modulo operation is performed for each pair of elements, and the results are stored in the tuple `res`.
For the given input `test_tup1 = (10, 4, 5, 6)` and `test_tup2 = (5, 6, 7, 5)`, the modulo operations are as follows:
- 10 % 5 = 0
- 4 % 6 = 4
- 5 % 7 = 5
- 6 % 5 = 1
The resulting tuple `res` will therefore be (0, 4, 5, 1).
The function returns this tuple.
<<<Output>>>
(0, 4, 5, 1)
