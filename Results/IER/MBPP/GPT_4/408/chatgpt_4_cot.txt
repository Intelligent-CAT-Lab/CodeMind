The function `k_smallest_pairs` is designed to find the k pairs with the smallest sums from two lists, `nums1` and `nums2`.

1. The `nums1` list is `[1,3,7]`, and the `nums2` list is `[2,4,6]`. The variable `k` is set to `2`, which means we need to find the 2 pairs with the smallest sums.

2. A min-heap `queue` is initialized as an empty list to store the potential pairs along with their sums.

3. A nested function `push(i, j)` is defined to push the sum of elements from `nums1` and `nums2` at indices `i` and `j` into the heap, along with the indices `i` and `j`.

4. The `push` function is called with arguments `(0, 0)` to push the sum of the first elements of `nums1` and `nums2` into the heap.

5. The `pairs` list is initialized to collect the k smallest pairs.

6. A while loop runs as long as there are elements in the `queue` and the length of `pairs` is less than `k`.

7. Inside the loop, the smallest sum and its corresponding indices `i` and `j` are popped from the heap.

8. The pair `[nums1[i], nums2[j]]` is appended to the `pairs` list.

9. The `push` function is called with `(i, j + 1)` to consider the next element in `nums2` with the current element in `nums1`.

10. If `j` is `0`, the `push` function is also called with `(i + 1, 0)` to consider the next element in `nums1` with the first element in `nums2`.

11. This process continues until we have collected `k` pairs.

For the input `([1,3,7],[2,4,6],2)`, the steps are as follows:

- Initially, the pair `(1, 2)` with sum `3` is pushed into the heap.
- The while loop starts, and since the heap is not empty and we have collected fewer than `k` pairs, we pop `(1, 2)` from the heap and add `[1, 2]` to `pairs`.
- We push the next pair `(1, 4)` with sum `5` into the heap and also push the pair `(3, 2)` with sum `5` because `j` was `0`.
- The next smallest sum in the heap is `5`, and we have two pairs with this sum: `(1, 4)` and `(3, 2)`. The heap returns them in the order they were inserted, so `(1, 4)` is popped next, and `[1, 4]` is added to `pairs`.
- Now we have collected `k` pairs, so the loop ends.

The final `pairs` list contains the two pairs with the smallest sums: `[[1, 2], [1, 4]]`.
