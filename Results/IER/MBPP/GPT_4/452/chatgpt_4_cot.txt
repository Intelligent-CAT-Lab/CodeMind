<<<Analysis>>>
The function `loss_amount` takes two arguments, `actual_cost` and `sale_amount`, which are initialized to 1500 and 1200, respectively.
The function checks if `sale_amount` is greater than `actual_cost`. In this case, it is not, since 1200 is less than 1500.
Since the condition is not met, the function proceeds to the else block and returns 0.
