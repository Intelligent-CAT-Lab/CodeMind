<<<Analysis>>>
The function `all_unique` is designed to check if all elements in the input list `test_list` are unique.
The input list is `[1,2,3]`.
The function first checks if the length of the input list is greater than the length of the set created from the input list.
A set in Python is a collection of unique elements, so converting a list to a set removes any duplicates.
For the input list `[1,2,3]`, converting it to a set will result in `{1,2,3}` which has the same length as the original list, indicating that all elements were unique.
Since the length of the list (3) is not greater than the length of the set (3), the condition in the `if` statement is `False`.
Therefore, the function skips the `if` block and goes directly to the `return True` statement.
The function will return `True`, indicating that all elements in the list are unique.
