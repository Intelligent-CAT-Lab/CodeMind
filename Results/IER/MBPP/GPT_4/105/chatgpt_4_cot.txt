<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count` takes a list `lst` as an argument.
The list `[True, False, True]` is passed to the function.
In Python, the boolean `True` has an integer value of 1, and `False` has an integer value of 0.
The `sum` function is called on the list, which adds up the integer values of the elements.
The sum of the list `[True, False, True]` is equivalent to `1 + 0 + 1`.
Therefore, the return value of the function `count` will be `2`.
