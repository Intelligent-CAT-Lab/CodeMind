<<<Analysis>>>
The function `flatten_list` is designed to flatten a nested list into a single list of values.

1. The input list `[0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]` is passed to the function.
2. The `result_list` is initialized as an empty list, which will store the flattened result.
3. A stack is initialized with the input list wrapped in another list.
4. The while loop starts and will continue until the stack is empty.
5. The first element of the stack is popped out, which is the entire input list.
6. The last element of this list is popped out and stored in `next`, which is `[90, 100, 110, 120]`.
7. Since the popped list `[90, 100, 110, 120]` is not empty, it is appended back to the stack.
8. `next` is a list, so it is wrapped in a list and appended to the stack.
9. This process continues, popping and appending elements to the stack and `result_list` until the stack is empty.
10. The elements are appended to `result_list` in reverse order, so `result_list` is reversed before returning.

The process of flattening will result in the following sequence of operations:
- Start with the initial list.
- Flatten `[90, 100, 110, 120]` to individual elements and add to `result_list`.
- Continue with `[60, 70, 80]`, then `50`, `40`, and `[20, 30]`, and finally `10` and `0`.
- The `result_list` before reversing: `[120, 110, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0]`.
- After reversing, the `result_list` will be: `[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]`.
