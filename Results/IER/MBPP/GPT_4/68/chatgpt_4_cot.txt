<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_Monotonic` takes a list A as input and checks if the list is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing.

The input list A is [6, 5, 4, 4].

The function uses two `all` functions with generator expressions to check the monotonicity of the list.

The first `all` function checks if every element at index i is less than or equal to the element at index i+1, which would mean the list is non-decreasing. For the input list [6, 5, 4, 4], this check will fail because 6 is not less than or equal to 5, 5 is not less than or equal to 4, and 4 is equal to 4. So, the first condition returns False.

The second `all` function checks if every element at index i is greater than or equal to the element at index i+1, which would mean the list is non-increasing. For the input list [6, 5, 4, 4], this check will pass because 6 is greater than 5, 5 is greater than 4, and 4 is equal to 4. So, the second condition returns True.

Since one of the conditions is True, the function will return True, indicating that the list [6, 5, 4, 4] is monotonic (specifically, it is non-increasing).
