<<<Analysis>>>
The function `split_two_parts` takes two arguments: a list `list1` and an integer `L`.
The list `list1` is initialized to `[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1]`, and `L` is initialized to 3.
The function returns a tuple of two lists. The first list contains the first `L` elements of `list1`, and the second list contains the remaining elements after the first `L` elements.
The slicing operation `list1[:L]` will return the first 3 elements of `list1`, which are `[1,1,2]`.
The slicing operation `list1[L:]` will return the elements of `list1` starting from index 3 to the end, which are `[3,4,4,5,1]`.
Therefore, the function will return a tuple with two lists: `([1,1,2], [3,4,4,5,1])`.
<<<Output>>>
([1,1,2], [3,4,4,5,1])
