<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_pairs_count` is designed to count the number of pairs in an array `arr` that add up to a given `sum`.

- The input array is `[1,1,1,1]`, and the target sum is `2`.
- The variable `count` is initialized to `0`. This variable will keep track of the number of valid pairs found.
- The function uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible pairs in the array without repeating any pair.
- The outer loop runs from the first element to the second-to-last element of the array.
- The inner loop runs from the element right after the current element of the outer loop to the last element of the array.
- For each pair `(arr[i], arr[j])`, the function checks if their sum equals the target sum `2`.
- If a pair is found that adds up to `2`, the `count` is incremented by `1`.
- Since all elements in the array are `1`, every unique pair of elements will add up to `2`.
- There are a total of 6 unique pairs that can be formed from the array `[1,1,1,1]`: (1st and 2nd), (1st and 3rd), (1st and 4th), (2nd and 3rd), (2nd and 4th), and (3rd and 4th).
- Each of these pairs adds up to `2`, so the `count` will be incremented 6 times.

After the loops complete, the function will return the value of `count`, which is `6`.
