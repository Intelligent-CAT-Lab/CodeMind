<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_distinct` is designed to check if all elements in a tuple are distinct. It initializes a variable `res` to `True` and creates an empty set `temp`.

The function then iterates over each element `ele` in the input tuple `test_tup` which is `(1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)`.

- It first checks if `1` is in `temp`. Since `temp` is empty, `1` is not found, so `1` is added to `temp`.
- Next, it checks if `4` is in `temp`. `4` is not found, so `4` is added to `temp`.
- It checks if `5` is in `temp`. `5` is not found, so `5` is added to `temp`.
- It checks if `6` is in `temp`. `6` is not found, so `6` is added to `temp`.
- It checks if `1` is in `temp`. Since `1` is already in `temp`, the function sets `res` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

The function does not need to check the remaining elements because it has already found a duplicate. It returns `False`.
