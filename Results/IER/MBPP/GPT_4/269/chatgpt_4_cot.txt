<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized to the character 'A'.
The function ascii_value takes this character and assigns it to the variable ch.
The built-in ord() function is then called with ch as its argument, which computes the ASCII value of the character 'A'.
The ASCII value of 'A' is 65.
The function returns this value.
<<<Output>>>
65
