<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_adverb_position` takes a single string argument `text`.
The regular expression `r"\w+ly"` is used to find all words that end with "ly", which typically are adverbs.
The `re.finditer` function is used to find all non-overlapping matches of the regular expression in the string.
The loop iterates over each match object `m` found by `re.finditer`.
For each match, the function returns a tuple containing the start position of the match `m.start()`, the end position of the match `m.end()`, and the matched text `m.group(0)`.
However, since the `return` statement is inside the loop, the function will return after finding the first match and will not continue to find any further matches.
In the given text "clearly!! we can see the sky", the first and only adverb that matches the pattern is "clearly".
The start position of "clearly" is 0, and the end position is 7 (since the index is zero-based and the end index is exclusive).
Therefore, the function will return the tuple (0, 7, "clearly") after finding the first adverb.
<<<Output>>>
(0, 7, "clearly")
