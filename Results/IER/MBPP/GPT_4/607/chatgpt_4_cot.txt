<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_literals` is defined with parameters `text` and `pattern`.
The variable `text` is initialized to the string 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.', and the variable `pattern` is initialized to the string 'fox'.
The function uses the `re.search` method from the `re` module to search for the pattern 'fox' in the given text.
The `search` method finds the first occurrence of the pattern 'fox' in the text.
The `match` object contains information about the match, including the start and end positions of the match in the text.
The `start()` method of the `match` object returns the start index of the match, which is 16.
The `end()` method of the `match` object returns the end index of the match, which is 19.
The function returns a tuple containing the pattern used for the match, the start index, and the end index of the match.
Therefore, the return value will be ('fox', 16, 19).
<<<Output>>>
('fox', 16, 19)
