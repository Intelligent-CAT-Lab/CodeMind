<<<Analysis>>>
The input list `a` is `[1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]`.
The variable `n` is initialized to the length of `a`, which is 6.
The list `dp` is initialized with 6 zeros: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
The last element of `dp` is set to 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]`.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from the second-to-last index of `a` to the first index (indices 4 to 0).
For each index `i`, it initializes `mxm` to 0 and enters another loop from `i + 1` to the end of the list.

For `i = 4` (element 17):
- It checks elements 18, and since 18 is not divisible by 17 and vice versa, `mxm` remains 0.
- `dp[4]` is set to `1 + mxm`, which is 1.

For `i = 3` (element 13):
- It checks elements 17 and 18, and since neither is divisible by 13 and vice versa, `mxm` remains 0.
- `dp[3]` is set to `1 + mxm`, which is 1.

For `i = 2` (element 6):
- It checks elements 13, 17, and 18. Element 18 is divisible by 6, so `mxm` is set to `dp[5]`, which is 1.
- `dp[2]` is set to `1 + mxm`, which is 2.

For `i = 1` (element 3):
- It checks elements 6, 13, 17, and 18. Element 6 is divisible by 3, so `mxm` is set to `dp[2]`, which is 2.
- `dp[1]` is set to `1 + mxm`, which is 3.

For `i = 0` (element 1):
- It checks all other elements. Since 1 divides all numbers, `mxm` is set to the maximum value in `dp[1:]`, which is 3 (from `dp[1]`).
- `dp[0]` is set to `1 + mxm`, which is 4.

The final `dp` list is `[4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1]`.
The function returns the maximum value in `dp`, which is 4.
