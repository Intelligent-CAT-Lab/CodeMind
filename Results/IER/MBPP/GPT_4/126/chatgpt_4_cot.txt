<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are initialized to 10 and 15, respectively.
The variable `sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of common divisors of `a` and `b`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the minimum of `a` and `b` (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 9.
For each number `i` in this range, the code checks if `i` is a divisor of both `a` and `b` (i.e., `a % i == 0 and b % i == 0`).
If `i` is a common divisor, it is added to the `sum`.
The common divisors of 10 and 15 within the range [1, 9] are 1 and 5.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `sum`, which is the sum of the common divisors found, in this case, 1 + 5 = 6.
