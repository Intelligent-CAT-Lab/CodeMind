<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Find_Min_Length` is called with the argument `lst` being `[[1],[1,2]]`.
The function calculates the minimum length of the sublists within `lst` using a generator expression `min(len(x) for x in lst)`.
The lengths of the sublists are 1 and 2, respectively.
The minimum of these lengths is 1.
Therefore, the function returns 1.
