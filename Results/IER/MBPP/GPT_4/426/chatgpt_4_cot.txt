<<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_oddnumbers` is defined with one parameter `nums`.
The input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` is passed to the function.
Inside the function, a lambda function is used to filter out the odd numbers from the input list. The lambda function checks if the remainder of the division of `x` by 2 is not equal to 0, which means it is an odd number.
The `filter` function applies this lambda to each element of the input list and returns an iterator that contains only the odd numbers.
The `list` function then converts this iterator into a list.
The resulting list of odd numbers is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
This list is returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
