<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_Product` is designed to find the pair of numbers in an array that produces the maximum product.

1. The input array is `[1,2,3,4,7,0,8,4]`.
2. The length of the array is 8, which is greater than 2, so the function proceeds.
3. The variables `x` and `y` are initialized to the first two elements of the array, which are 1 and 2, respectively.
4. The function enters a nested loop where `i` ranges from 0 to the length of the array, and `j` ranges from `i + 1` to the length of the array.
5. Inside the nested loop, the function checks if the product of `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is greater than the product of `x` and `y`.
6. If a greater product is found, `x` and `y` are updated to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`.
7. The loop continues until all pairs have been checked.
8. The maximum product is found when `x` is 8 and `y` is 7, which gives a product of 56.
9. The function returns the pair `(x, y)` which is `(8, 7)`.

(8, 7)
