<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_length_list` is designed to find the list with the maximum length from a list of lists and return a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself.

The variable `input_list` is initialized to `[[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`.

The code first calculates the maximum length of the lists within `input_list` using a generator expression `max(len(x) for x in input_list)`. The lengths of the lists are 1, 2, 2, 2, and 3, respectively. Therefore, the maximum length is 3.

Next, the code finds the list with the maximum length using the `max` function with a key that is a lambda function `lambda i: len(i)`. This will return the first list that has the maximum length, which is `[13, 15, 17]`.

Finally, the function returns a tuple `(max_length, max_list)`, which in this case is `(3, [13, 15, 17])`.

<<<Output>>>
(3, [13, 15, 17])
