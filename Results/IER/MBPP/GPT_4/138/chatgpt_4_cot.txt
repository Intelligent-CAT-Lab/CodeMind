<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two` takes an integer n as input.
The function checks if n is odd by taking the modulo of n with 2. If the result is 1, the function returns False.
If n is not odd (meaning it is even), the function returns True.
For the input 10, since 10 % 2 equals 0 (10 is even), the function will return True.
However, the function's name suggests it should check if a number is a sum of powers of two, but the actual implementation only checks if the number is even. The name is misleading based on the implementation.
<<<Output>>>
True
