<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_remainder` takes two arguments: an array `arr` and an integer `n`. The array `arr` is `[100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14]` and `n` is `11`.

The variable `mul` is initialized to `1`. This variable will be used to store the product of the elements of `arr` modulo `n`.

The function enters a loop that iterates over the elements of `arr`.

For each element `arr[i]` in `arr`, the following operations are performed:
1. `arr[i] % n` calculates the remainder of `arr[i]` divided by `n`.
2. `(mul * (arr[i] % n))` multiplies the current value of `mul` by the remainder found in step 1.
3. `(mul * (arr[i] % n)) % n` calculates the remainder of the product found in step 2 divided by `n`, and assigns this value back to `mul`.

The remainders when each element of `arr` is divided by `n` (11) are:
- `100 % 11` is `1`
- `10 % 11` is `10`
- `5 % 11` is `5`
- `25 % 11` is `3`
- `35 % 11` is `2`
- `14 % 11` is `3`

The product `mul` is updated in each iteration as follows:
- Initially, `mul` is `1`.
- After the first element, `mul` becomes `(1 * 1) % 11` which is `1`.
- After the second element, `mul` becomes `(1 * 10) % 11` which is `10`.
- After the third element, `mul` becomes `(10 * 5) % 11` which is `50 % 11` which is `6`.
- After the fourth element, `mul` becomes `(6 * 3) % 11` which is `18 % 11` which is `7`.
- After the fifth element, `mul` becomes `(7 * 2) % 11` which is `14 % 11` which is `3`.
- After the sixth element, `mul` becomes `(3 * 3) % 11` which is `9 % 11` which is `9`.

Finally, the function returns `mul % n`, which is `9 % 11`. Since `9` is less than `11`, the remainder is `9`.
