The function `remove_dirty_chars` is designed to remove all characters from the first string (`string`) that are present in the second string (`second_string`). Here's how it works:

1. The `get_char_count_array` function creates an array `count` of size `NO_OF_CHARS` (256, which is the number of ASCII characters) with all elements initialized to 0. It then increments the value at the index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in `second_string`. For "pros", the count array will have non-zero values at the indices corresponding to 'p', 'r', 'o', and 's'.

2. The `str_to_list` function converts the first string "probasscurve" into a list of characters.

3. The `remove_dirty_chars` function then iterates over each character in the list. If the count of the character (in the `count` array) is 0, which means the character is not present in `second_string`, it is kept in the result by copying it to the `res_ind` index of `str_list`.

4. The `lst_to_string` function then converts the list of characters back into a string, but only up to the `res_ind` index, effectively removing the "dirty" characters.

For the input "probasscurve" and "pros", the characters 'p', 'r', 'o', and 's' will be removed from the first string. The remaining characters will be 'ba', 'cu', 've', which when concatenated, result in "bacurve".

<<<Output>>>
"bacurve"
