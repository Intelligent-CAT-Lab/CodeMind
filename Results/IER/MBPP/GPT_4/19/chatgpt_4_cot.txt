<<<Analysis>>>
The function `test_duplicate` takes a single argument `arraynums`, which is expected to be a list of numbers.
The input provided is `([1,2,3,4,5])`, which seems to be a single-element tuple containing a list of numbers. However, it is likely that the intention was to pass a list, so we will assume the input is `[1,2,3,4,5]`.
The function creates a set from the list called `nums_set`. Sets in Python are collections of unique elements, so any duplicates in the list would be removed in the set.
The function then compares the length of the original list `arraynums` with the length of the set `nums_set`.
If there were any duplicates in the original list, the length of the set would be less than the length of the list, and the function would return `True`.
However, since the list `[1,2,3,4,5]` contains no duplicates, the lengths of the list and the set will be the same.
Therefore, the function will return `False`, indicating that there are no duplicates in the list.
