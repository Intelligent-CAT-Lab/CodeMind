<<<Analysis>>>
The function `noprofit_noloss` takes two arguments, `actual_cost` and `sale_amount`.
The `actual_cost` is set to 1500 and the `sale_amount` is set to 1200.
The function checks if `sale_amount` is equal to `actual_cost`.
Since 1200 is not equal to 1500, the condition is False.
Therefore, the function will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
