<<<Analysis>>>
The function `reverse_string_list` takes a list of strings as an argument. The input list is `['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'White', 'Black']`.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input list.
For each string `x` in the list, it applies the slice operation `x[::-1]` which reverses the string.
The reversed strings are collected into a new list called `result`.
The reversed strings are as follows:
- 'Red' becomes 'deR'
- 'Green' becomes 'neerG'
- 'Blue' becomes 'eulB'
- 'White' becomes 'etihW'
- 'Black' becomes 'kcalB'
The function then returns the `result` list which contains the reversed strings in the same order as they appeared in the input list.
<<<Output>>>
['deR', 'neerG', 'eulB', 'etihW', 'kcalB']
