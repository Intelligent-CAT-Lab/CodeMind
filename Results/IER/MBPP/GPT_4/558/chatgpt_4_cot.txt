<<<Analysis>>>
The function `digit_distance_nums` takes two arguments, n1 and n2, which are 1 and 2, respectively.
The function calculates the absolute difference between n1 and n2, which is abs(1-2) = 1.
The absolute difference is then converted to a string, which is '1'.
The `map` function is used to convert each character in the string to an integer. Since there is only one character, the map function will only have one element, which is 1.
The `sum` function then adds up the elements in the map object, which in this case is just 1.
The function returns this sum, which is 1.
