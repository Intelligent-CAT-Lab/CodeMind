<<<Analysis>>>
The function `heap_queue_largest` is defined with two parameters: `nums`, which is a list of numbers, and `n`, which is the number of largest elements to return from the list.
The `nums` list is initialized to `[25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58]`, and `n` is initialized to `3`.
The function uses the `nlargest` method from the `heapq` module to find the `n` largest elements in the `nums` list.
The `nlargest` method will create a min-heap of the `nums` list and then pop the largest `n` elements from it.
The `nlargest` method will return the three largest numbers from the list, which are `[85, 75, 65]`.
The function then returns this list of the three largest numbers.
<<<Output>>>
[85, 75, 65]
