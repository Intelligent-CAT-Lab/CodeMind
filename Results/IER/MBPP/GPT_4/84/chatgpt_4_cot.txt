<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sequence` is a recursive function that calculates a value based on the previous values in the sequence. The base cases are when n is 1 or 2, in which case the function returns 1.

Let's analyze the calls step by step for `sequence(10)`:

1. sequence(10) calls sequence(9) and sequence(10 - sequence(9))
2. sequence(9) calls sequence(8) and sequence(9 - sequence(8))
3. sequence(8) calls sequence(7) and sequence(8 - sequence(7))
4. sequence(7) calls sequence(6) and sequence(7 - sequence(6))
5. sequence(6) calls sequence(5) and sequence(6 - sequence(5))
6. sequence(5) calls sequence(4) and sequence(5 - sequence(4))
7. sequence(4) calls sequence(3) and sequence(4 - sequence(3))
8. sequence(3) calls sequence(2) and sequence(3 - sequence(2))
9. sequence(2) is a base case and returns 1
10. sequence(3 - sequence(2)) is sequence(3 - 1) which is sequence(2), so it returns 1
11. sequence(3) returns sequence(2) + sequence(1) which is 1 + 1 = 2
12. sequence(4 - sequence(3)) is sequence(4 - 2) which is sequence(2), so it returns 1
13. sequence(4) returns sequence(3) + sequence(1) which is 2 + 1 = 3
14. sequence(5 - sequence(4)) is sequence(5 - 3) which is sequence(2), so it returns 1
15. sequence(5) returns sequence(4) + sequence(1) which is 3 + 1 = 4
16. sequence(6 - sequence(5)) is sequence(6 - 4) which is sequence(2), so it returns 1
17. sequence(6) returns sequence(5) + sequence(1) which is 4 + 1 = 5
18. sequence(7 - sequence(6)) is sequence(7 - 5) which is sequence(2), so it returns 1
19. sequence(7) returns sequence(6) + sequence(1) which is 5 + 1 = 6
20. sequence(8 - sequence(7)) is sequence(8 - 6) which is sequence(2), so it returns 1
21. sequence(8) returns sequence(7) + sequence(1) which is 6 + 1 = 7
22. sequence(9 - sequence(8)) is sequence(9 - 7) which is sequence(2), so it returns 1
23. sequence(9) returns sequence(8) + sequence(1) which is 7 + 1 = 8
24. sequence(10 - sequence(9)) is sequence(10 - 8) which is sequence(2), so it returns 1
25. sequence(10) returns sequence(9) + sequence(1) which is 8 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the return value of `sequence(10)` is 9.
