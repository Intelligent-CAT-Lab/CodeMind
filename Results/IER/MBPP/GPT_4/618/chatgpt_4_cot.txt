<<<Analysis>>>
The function `div_list` takes two lists `nums1` and `nums2` as arguments.
The `map` function is used with a lambda function that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns the result of `x / y`.
The `map` function applies the lambda function to each pair of elements from `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
The pairs of elements are (4, 1), (5, 2), and (6, 3).
The lambda function is applied to these pairs, resulting in the division of each pair: 4/1, 5/2, and 6/3.
The results of these divisions are 4.0, 2.5, and 2.0 respectively.
The `map` function returns an iterator, which is then converted to a list using the `list` function.
The final result is a list containing the results of the divisions: [4.0, 2.5, 2.0].
<<<Output>>>
[4.0, 2.5, 2.0]
