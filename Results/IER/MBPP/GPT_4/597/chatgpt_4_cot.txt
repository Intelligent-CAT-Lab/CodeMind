<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_kth` is designed to merge two sorted arrays `arr1` and `arr2` and find the k-th smallest element in the merged array.

- `arr1` is initialized to [2, 3, 6, 7, 9], and `arr2` is initialized to [1, 4, 8, 10]. The variable `k` is initialized to 5.
- The lengths of `arr1` and `arr2` are stored in `m` and `n`, which are 5 and 4, respectively.
- A new list `sorted1` of size `m + n` (9) is created to store the merged array.
- Three indices `i`, `j`, and `d` are initialized to 0. These will be used to iterate over `arr1`, `arr2`, and `sorted1`, respectively.
- The first `while` loop compares elements of `arr1` and `arr2` and adds the smaller one to `sorted1`. This loop continues until one of the arrays is fully traversed.
  - The elements added to `sorted1` in order are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. At this point, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `d` is 5.
- Since `i` is not yet `m`, the second `while` loop continues to add the remaining elements of `arr1` to `sorted1`. However, since we are looking for the 5th element and `d` is already 5, we don't need to continue with the loop.
- The third `while` loop is not executed because `j` is not yet `n`, but again, it's not needed for finding the 5th element.
- Finally, the function returns the element at index `k - 1` (4) of `sorted1`, which is 6.
