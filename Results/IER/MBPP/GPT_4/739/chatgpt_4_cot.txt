<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The function find_Index is called with the argument 2.
Inside the function, the expression math.sqrt(2 * math.pow(10,(n - 1))) is evaluated.
First, math.pow(10, (n - 1)) calculates 10 raised to the power of (2 - 1), which is 10^1, resulting in 10.
Then, this result is multiplied by 2, giving 2 * 10 = 20.
Next, math.sqrt(20) calculates the square root of 20, which is approximately 4.47213595499958.
Finally, the round function is applied to the square root of 20, which rounds it to the nearest integer, resulting in 4.
The function returns this value.
