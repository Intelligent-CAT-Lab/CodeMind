<<<Analysis>>>
The function `swap_List` is designed to swap the first and last elements of a list.
The input list is `[12, 35, 9, 56, 24]`.
The variable `size` is initialized to the length of the list, which is 5.
The variable `temp` is assigned the value of the first element of the list, which is 12.
The first element of the list `newList[0]` is then replaced with the last element of the list `newList[size - 1]`, which is 24.
The last element of the list `newList[size - 1]` is then replaced with the value stored in `temp`, which is 12.
The modified list is now `[24, 35, 9, 56, 12]`.
The function returns this modified list.
<<<Output>>>
[24, 35, 9, 56, 12]
