<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized to 99.
The function next_smallest_palindrome is defined to find the next smallest palindrome number greater than the input number.
The code enters a loop starting from num+1 (which is 100) and goes up to sys.maxsize (which is the largest integer a variable can hold in the system's Python environment).
For each number i in this range, the code checks if the string representation of i is the same as its reverse (which would make it a palindrome).
The loop continues until it finds a number that satisfies this condition.
The first number greater than 99 that is a palindrome is 101, as it reads the same forwards and backwards.
Once the palindrome is found, the function returns this number.
<<<Output>>>
101
