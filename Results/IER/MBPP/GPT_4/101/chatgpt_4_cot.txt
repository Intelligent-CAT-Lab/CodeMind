<<<Analysis>>>
The function `kth_element` is designed to return the k-th smallest element in the array `arr`. The array and k are given as `[12,3,5,7,19]` and `2`, respectively.

The length of the array `n` is calculated to be 5.

The function then enters a nested loop structure intended to sort the array using the bubble sort algorithm. The outer loop runs 5 times (from 0 to 4), and the inner loop runs in decreasing order of iterations, starting from 4 down to 0.

However, there is a mistake in the inner loop's if statement. Instead of swapping the elements using `arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]`, the code mistakenly uses `==` which is a comparison operator, not an assignment operator. This means that no elements will be swapped, and the array will not be sorted.

Since the array is not sorted, the function will return the element at the original (k-1)-th index of the unsorted array, which is `arr[1]` (since k is 2). The element at index 1 in the original array is `3`.

Therefore, the function will incorrectly return `3` instead of the correct second smallest element, which would be `5` if the array were sorted correctly.
