<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3, and the variable str is initialized to "python is a programming language".
An empty list word_len is created to store words longer than n characters.
The string str is split into a list of words using the split() method, resulting in the list ['python', 'is', 'a', 'programming', 'language'].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each word in the list.
For each word x in the list, it checks if the length of x is greater than n (3 in this case).
The words 'python', 'programming', and 'language' have lengths greater than 3, so they are appended to the word_len list.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the word_len list, which contains the words that are longer than 3 characters.
<<<Output>>>
['python', 'programming', 'language']
