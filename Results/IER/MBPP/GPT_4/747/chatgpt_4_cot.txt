The function `lcs_of_three` is designed to find the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) present in all three strings X, Y, and Z.

1. The lengths of the strings X, Y, and Z are stored in variables m, n, and o, respectively. For the given input, m = 6 (length of 'AGGT12'), n = 7 (length of '12TXAYB'), and o = 5 (length of '12XBA').

2. A 3D list L is created with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1) x (o+1), initialized with zeros. This list will be used for dynamic programming to store the lengths of the LCS at sub-problems.

3. The function then uses three nested loops to fill in the 3D list L. The loops iterate over the range of the lengths of the three strings plus one (to include the base case of an empty subsequence).

4. The base case is handled first: if any of the indices i, j, or k is 0, L[i][j][k] is set to 0, representing an empty subsequence.

5. If the characters at the current indices of all three strings match (X[i-1] == Y[j-1] and X[i-1] == Z[k-1]), the function sets L[i][j][k] to the value of L[i-1][j-1][k-1] + 1, extending the length of the LCS by 1.

6. If the characters do not match, the function sets L[i][j][k] to the maximum value among L[i-1][j][k], L[i][j-1][k], and L[i][j][k-1], which represents the longest LCS found so far without including the current character from one of the strings.

7. After filling the 3D list, the function returns the value at L[m][n][o], which represents the length of the LCS for the entire strings X, Y, and Z.

For the given input strings 'AGGT12', '12TXAYB', and '12XBA', the LCS is '12' with a length of 2.
