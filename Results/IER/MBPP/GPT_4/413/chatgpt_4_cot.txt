<<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_nth_element` is defined with two parameters: `list1` and `n`.
The variable `list1` is initialized with a list of tuples, each containing a name and two numbers.
The variable `n` is initialized to 0, which indicates that the function will extract the element at index 0 from each tuple in the list.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each tuple in `list1` and extract the element at index `n` (which is 0 in this case).
The list comprehension will create a new list containing the names 'Greyson Fulton', 'Brady Kent', 'Wyatt Knott', and 'Beau Turnbull', as these are the elements at index 0 in each tuple.
The result is then returned, which is a list of the extracted names.
<<<Output>>>
['Greyson Fulton', 'Brady Kent', 'Wyatt Knott', 'Beau Turnbull']
