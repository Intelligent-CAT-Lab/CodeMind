<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_Occurrence` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as arguments. The tuple is `('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd')` and the list is `['a', 'b']`.
The variable `count` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of occurrences of elements from `lst` in `tup`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each item in the tuple `tup`.
For each item in the tuple, the code checks if the item is present in the list `lst`.
If the item is present in the list, the code increments the `count` by 1.
The items 'a' and 'b' from the tuple are present in the list, and 'a' appears twice in the tuple.
Therefore, the count will be incremented three times (twice for 'a' and once for 'b').
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `count`, which is 3.
