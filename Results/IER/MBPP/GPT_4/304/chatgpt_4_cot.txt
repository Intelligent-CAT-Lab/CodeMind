<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_Element` takes four parameters: `arr`, `ranges`, `rotations`, and `index`.
- `arr` is the array of elements.
- `ranges` is a list of pairs, each pair representing a range of indices in `arr` that are to be rotated.
- `rotations` is the number of rotations to be performed.
- `index` is the position in the array for which we want to find the element after all rotations.

The input parameters are `arr = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `ranges = [[0,2],[0,3]]`, `rotations = 2`, and `index = 1`.

The function starts by iterating over the `ranges` in reverse order, meaning it starts with the last range and moves to the first.

1. In the first iteration, `i = 1`, the range is `[0,3]`. The `left` is 0 and the `right` is 3.
   - Since `left <= index` and `right >= index` are both true (0 <= 1 and 3 >= 1), we check if `index` is equal to `left`.
   - Since `index` is not equal to `left`, we decrement `index` by 1, so `index` becomes 0.

2. In the second iteration, `i = 0`, the range is `[0,2]`. The `left` is 0 and the `right` is 2.
   - Since `left <= index` and `right >= index` are both true (0 <= 0 and 2 >= 0), we check if `index` is equal to `left`.
   - Since `index` is equal to `left`, we set `index` to `right`, so `index` becomes 2.

After all rotations, we return the element at the final `index` in `arr`, which is `arr[2]`.

The element at `arr[2]` is 3.
