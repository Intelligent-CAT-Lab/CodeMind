<<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_odd` is designed to remove all odd numbers from a list `l`.
The input list is `[1,2,3]`.
The function starts by iterating over each element in the list.
When `i` is 1, it is odd (`1 % 2 != 0` is True), so 1 is removed from the list. The list now becomes `[2,3]`.
The loop continues, but since the list has been modified, it now skips the next element (which is 3) because the indices of the elements have shifted after the removal of 1. The loop now considers the element at the next index, which does not exist because the list has only two elements now.
As a result, the function ends the loop and returns the list with the remaining elements, which is `[2,3]`.
The function does not remove the number 3, which is also odd, due to the modification of the list during iteration.
<<<Output>>>
[2,3]
