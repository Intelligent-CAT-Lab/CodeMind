<<<Analysis>>>
The function `pancake_sort` is designed to sort an array of numbers using the pancake sorting algorithm. The input array is `[15, 79, 25, 38, 69]`.

1. The length of the array is determined to be 5.
2. The while loop will continue until the length of the array to be considered is greater than 1.
3. The index of the maximum number in the current range of the array is found. For the first iteration, the maximum number is 79, and its index is 1.
4. The array is flipped from the start to the index of the maximum number, resulting in `[79, 15, 25, 38, 69]`.
5. The array is then flipped again from the start to the length of the array minus one, resulting in `[69, 38, 25, 15, 79]`.
6. The length of the array to be considered is reduced by one, and the process repeats.

Following the steps above, the array will be sorted as follows:
- Initial array: `[15, 79, 25, 38, 69]`
- After first iteration: `[69, 38, 25, 15, 79]`
- After second iteration: `[25, 38, 69, 15, 79]`
- After third iteration: `[38, 25, 69, 15, 79]`
- After fourth iteration: `[15, 69, 25, 38, 79]`
- After fifth iteration (array length is 1, loop ends): `[15, 69, 25, 38, 79]`

The final sorted array is `[15, 25, 38, 69, 79]`.

<<<Output>>>
[15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
