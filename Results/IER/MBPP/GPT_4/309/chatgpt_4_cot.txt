<<<Analysis>>>
The function `maximum` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are initialized to 5 and 10, respectively.
The function then checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
Since `a` (5) is not greater than or equal to `b` (10), the condition is false.
Therefore, the function proceeds to the `else` block.
The `else` block returns `b`, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
