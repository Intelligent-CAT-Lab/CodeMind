<<<Analysis>>>
The function `replace_specialchar` takes a string `text` as input.
The function uses the `re.sub` method from the `re` (regular expression) module to replace all occurrences of the characters space (" "), comma (","), and period (".") with colons (":").
The regular expression pattern "[ ,.]" matches any single character that is either a space, a comma, or a period.
The input string 'Python language, Programming language.' will be processed by replacing each matched character with a colon.
The space after "Python" will be replaced with a colon, the comma after "language" will be replaced with a colon, the space after "Programming" will be replaced with a colon, and the period at the end will be replaced with a colon.
The resulting string will be 'Python:language::Programming:language:'
<<<Output>>>
'Python:language::Programming:language:'
