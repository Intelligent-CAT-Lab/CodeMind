<<<Analysis>>>
The function `tuple_str_int` takes a string `test_str` as input.
The input string `"(7, 8, 9)"` is processed by removing the parentheses and ellipsis characters using the `replace` method.
The resulting string `"7, 8, 9"` is then split into a list of strings `['7', '8', '9']` using the `split` method with the delimiter `, `.
A generator expression is used to convert each string in the list to an integer.
The generator expression is passed to the `tuple` constructor to create a tuple of integers.
The resulting tuple `(7, 8, 9)` is returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
(7, 8, 9)
