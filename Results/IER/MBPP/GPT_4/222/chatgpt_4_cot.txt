<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_type` is designed to check if all elements in a tuple are of the same type as the first element of the tuple.
The input test_tuple is initialized to (5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6).
The variable `res` is initialized to True, which will be the default return value unless an element of a different type is found.
The code enters a loop that iterates over each element in the tuple.
For each element `ele` in the tuple, the code checks if the element is of the same type as the first element of the tuple using `isinstance(ele, type(test_tuple[0]))`.
Since all elements in the tuple are integers and the first element is also an integer, the condition `isinstance(ele, type(test_tuple[0]))` will always be True.
The loop completes without setting `res` to False.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of `res`, which is True.
