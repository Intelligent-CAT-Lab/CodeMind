<<<Analysis>>>
The function `bell_number` is designed to calculate the nth Bell number. The Bell number represents the number of ways a set with n elements can be partitioned into non-empty subsets.

The variable n is initialized to 2.

A two-dimensional list `bell` is created with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1), which in this case is 3x3, and all elements are initialized to 0.

The element at `bell[0][0]` is set to 1, which is the base case for the Bell numbers (B0 = 1).

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider 1 and 2 in this case.

For i = 1:
- `bell[1][0]` is set to `bell[0][0]`, which is 1.
- Another loop starts for j from 1 to i (inclusive), which will only consider j = 1.
- `bell[1][1]` is set to `bell[0][0] + bell[1][0]`, which is 1 + 1 = 2.

For i = 2:
- `bell[2][0]` is set to `bell[1][1]`, which is 2.
- Another loop starts for j from 1 to i (inclusive), which will consider j = 1 and j = 2.
- For j = 1: `bell[2][1]` is set to `bell[1][0] + bell[2][0]`, which is 1 + 2 = 3.
- For j = 2: `bell[2][2]` is set to `bell[1][1] + bell[2][1]`, which is 2 + 3 = 5.

After the loops finish, the function returns `bell[n][0]`, which is `bell[2][0]` in this case, and the value is 2.
