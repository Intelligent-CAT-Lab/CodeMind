The function `dict_depth` is called with a dictionary `{'a':1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}`.

1. The function checks if the input is a dictionary, which it is, so it proceeds.
2. It then calls itself recursively for each value in the dictionary.
3. For the key 'a', the value is 1, which is not a dictionary, so the recursive call returns 0.
4. For the key 'b', the value is another dictionary `{'c': {'d': {}}}`. The function is called recursively on this dictionary.
5. Inside this dictionary, for the key 'c', the value is another dictionary `{'d': {}}`. The function is called recursively on this dictionary.
6. Inside this dictionary, for the key 'd', the value is an empty dictionary `{}`. The function is called recursively on this dictionary.
7. Since the dictionary is empty, the `if d` check fails, and 0 is returned.
8. The recursive call for the key 'd' returns 1 + 0 = 1.
9. The recursive call for the key 'c' returns 1 + 1 = 2.
10. The recursive call for the key 'b' returns 1 + 2 = 3.
11. The function then takes the maximum of the depths returned for each key, which is max(0, 3) = 3.
12. Finally, the function returns 1 + 3 = 4, which is the maximum depth of the dictionary.
