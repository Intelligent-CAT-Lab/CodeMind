<<<Analysis>>>
The function `replace_spaces` takes a single string argument `text`.
The function returns a new string where each space character `' '` in the input `text` is replaced with an underscore `'_'`, and each underscore `'_'` in the input `text` is replaced with a space `' '`. However, since there are no underscores in the input string, only spaces will be replaced with underscores.
The input string is `'Jumanji The Jungle'`.
The function iterates over each character in the input string and checks:
- If the character is an underscore `'_'`, it should be replaced with a space `' '`, but there are no underscores in the input string.
- If the character is a space `' '`, it should be replaced with an underscore `'_'`.
- Any other character remains unchanged.
The input string has two spaces, one between `'Jumanji'` and `'The'`, and another between `'The'` and `'Jungle'`.
The output string will therefore be `'Jumanji_The_Jungle'`, with the spaces replaced by underscores.
