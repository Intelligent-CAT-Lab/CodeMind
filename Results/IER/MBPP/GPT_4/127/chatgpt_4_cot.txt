<<<Analysis>>>
The function `multiply_int` is a recursive function that multiplies two integers x and y without using the multiplication operator. The function takes two arguments, x and y, which are initialized to 10 and 20, respectively.

1. The function checks if y is less than 0, which it is not in this case (y is 20).
2. The function then checks if y is equal to 0, which it is not.
3. The function then checks if y is equal to 1, which it is not.
4. Since none of the above conditions are met, the function proceeds to the else block, which returns `x + multiply_int(x, y - 1)`. This means the function will call itself with y decremented by 1 (y becomes 19), and add x (which is 10) to the result of the recursive call.
5. This process will repeat, decrementing y by 1 each time and adding x to the result, until y eventually becomes 1.
6. When y is 1, the function will return x (which is 10), and the recursion will begin to unwind.
7. The final result will be 10 added together 20 times, which is equivalent to 10 * 20.

The return value of `multiply_int(10,20)` will be 200, as it is the result of adding 10 to itself 20 times.
