<<<Analysis>>>
The function `pos_count` takes a list as an input and initializes a variable `pos_count` to 0, which will be used to count the number of non-negative numbers in the list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each number in the list.
For each number, it checks if the number is greater than or equal to 0.
If the condition is true, it increments `pos_count` by 1.
The input list is `[1, -2, 3, -4]`.
The numbers 1 and 3 meet the condition (they are non-negative), so `pos_count` is incremented twice.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `pos_count`, which is 2.
