<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_monthnumb_number` takes a single argument `monthnum2`.
The argument `monthnum2` is compared against a list of numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12.
These numbers represent the months of the year that have 31 days.
The function checks if `monthnum2` is equal to any of these numbers using the `or` operator.
If `monthnum2` matches any of these numbers, the function returns `True`.
If `monthnum2` does not match any of these numbers, the function returns `False`.
In this case, `monthnum2` is 5, which is in the list of numbers.
Therefore, the function will return `True`.
