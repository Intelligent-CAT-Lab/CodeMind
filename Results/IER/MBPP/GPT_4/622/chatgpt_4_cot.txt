<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_median` is designed to find the median of two sorted arrays of the same size. The arrays are `[1, 12, 15, 26, 38]` and `[2, 13, 17, 30, 45]`, and the size `n` is 5.

The variables `i` and `j` are initialized to 0 to serve as indices for `arr1` and `arr2` respectively. `m1` and `m2` are initialized to -1 and will hold the last two elements considered in the merged array.

The `count` variable is used to keep track of how many elements have been considered. The loop continues until `count` is less than `n + 1` (which is 6 in this case).

The loop works as follows:
- If `i` is equal to `n`, it means `arr1` is exhausted, so `m1` is set to `m2` and `m2` is set to the first element of `arr2`. The loop then breaks.
- If `j` is equal to `n`, it means `arr2` is exhausted, so `m1` is set to `m2` and `m2` is set to the first element of `arr1`. The loop then breaks.
- If the current element of `arr1` is less than or equal to the current element of `arr2`, `m1` is set to `m2`, `m2` is set to the current element of `arr1`, and `i` is incremented.
- Otherwise, `m1` is set to `m2`, `m2` is set to the current element of `arr2`, and `j` is incremented.

The loop will continue until `count` reaches 6. At each iteration, `m1` and `m2` are updated to hold the last two elements that would be in the merged array if it were explicitly created.

The median is the average of `m1` and `m2` when the loop ends.

Let's simulate the loop:
- count = 1: arr1[0] <= arr2[0] (1 <= 2), so m1 = -1, m2 = 1, i = 1
- count = 2: arr1[1] > arr2[0] (12 > 2), so m1 = 1, m2 = 2, j = 1
- count = 3: arr1[1] <= arr2[1] (12 <= 13), so m1 = 2, m2 = 12, i = 2
- count = 4: arr1[2] > arr2[1] (15 > 13), so m1 = 12, m2 = 13, j = 2
- count = 5: arr1[2] <= arr2[2] (15 <= 17), so m1 = 13, m2 = 15, i = 3
- count = 6: arr1[3] > arr2[2] (26 > 17), so m1 = 15, m2 = 17, j = 3

The loop ends here because `count` is now equal to `n + 1`. The median is the average of `m1` and `m2`, which are 15 and 17.

The median is (15 + 17) / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16.
