<<<Analysis>>>
The function `merge_sorted_list` takes three lists as input: `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.

1. Each of the lists is sorted individually using the `sorted` function.
   - `num1` becomes `[4, 5, 15, 24, 25, 29, 110]`
   - `num2` becomes `[11, 19, 20, 25, 56, 154, 233]`
   - `num3` becomes `[24, 26, 48, 54]`

2. The `heapq.merge` function is then used to merge these sorted lists into a single sorted iterable. This function merges multiple sorted inputs into a single sorted output (similar to how merge works in mergesort), and returns an iterator over the sorted values.

3. The iterator returned by `heapq.merge` is then converted into a list using the `list` function.

4. The final result is a list that contains all the elements from `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`, sorted in non-decreasing order.

The expected output will be the sorted list of all the numbers from the three input lists.
