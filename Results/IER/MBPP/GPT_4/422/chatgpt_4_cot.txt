<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of cubes of numbers from 1 to n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers 1 and 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the cube of i (i * i * i) and adds it to sum.
When i is 1, 1^3 is added to sum, making sum = 1.
When i is 2, 2^3 (which is 8) is added to sum, making sum = 1 + 8 = 9.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the average of the sum of cubes by dividing sum by n, which is 9 / 2 = 4.5.
The result is then rounded to 6 decimal places, which does not change the value since 4.5 has no fractional part beyond the decimal point.
The function returns this rounded average.
<<<Output>>>
4.5
