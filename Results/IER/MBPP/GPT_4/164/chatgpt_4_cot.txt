<<<Analysis>>>
The function `are_equivalent` checks if two numbers, `num1` and `num2`, have the same sum of divisors. It does this by calling the `div_sum` function for each number and comparing the results.

For `num1` which is 36:
- The `div_sum` function initializes `total` to 1 and `i` to 2.
- It enters a while loop that runs as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `n` (36 in this case).
- The loop checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it adds `i` and the floor of `n / i` to `total`.
- For `i = 2`, `36 % 2 == 0` is true, so `total` becomes `1 + 2 + 36 / 2` which is `1 + 2 + 18` equal to 21.
- For `i = 3`, `36 % 3 == 0` is true, so `total` becomes `21 + 3 + 36 / 3` which is `21 + 3 + 12` equal to 36.
- For `i = 4`, `36 % 4 == 0` is true, so `total` becomes `36 + 4 + 36 / 4` which is `36 + 4 + 9` equal to 49.
- For `i = 5`, `36 % 5 != 0`, so `total` remains 49.
- For `i = 6`, `36 % 6 == 0` is true, but since `i * i` is equal to `n`, we only add `i` once to avoid double counting. So `total` becomes `49 + 6` which is 55.
- The loop ends when `i` is greater than 6 because `7 * 7` is greater than 36.

For `num2` which is 57:
- The `div_sum` function initializes `total` to 1 and `i` to 2.
- It enters a while loop that runs as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `n` (57 in this case).
- The loop checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it adds `i` and the floor of `n / i` to `total`.
- For `i = 2`, `57 % 2 != 0`, so `total` remains 1.
- For `i = 3`, `57 % 3 == 0` is true, so `total` becomes `1 + 3 + 57 / 3` which is `1 + 3 + 19` equal to 23.
- For `i = 4`, `57 % 4 != 0`, so `total` remains 23.
- For `i = 5`, `57 % 5 != 0`, so `total` remains 23.
- For `i = 6`, `57 % 6 != 0`, so `total` remains 23.
- The loop ends when `i` is greater than 7 because `8 * 8` is greater than 57.

The `div_sum` for 36 is 55 and for 57 is 23. Since these two sums are not equal, the function `are_equivalent` will return `False`.
