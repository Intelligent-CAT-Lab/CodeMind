<<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized to "aaaa".
The variable tmp is created by concatenating str with itself, resulting in "aaaaaaaa".
The variable n is set to the length of str, which is 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider indices from 1 to 4.
For each index i in this range, it creates a substring of tmp starting from index i and spanning n characters.
The code checks if str is equal to the substring. Since str is "aaaa" and all substrings of the same length from tmp will also be "aaaa", the condition (str == substring) will be true on the first iteration of the loop.
Therefore, the function will return the value of i, which is 1, on the first iteration.
