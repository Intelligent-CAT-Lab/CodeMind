<<<Analysis>>>
The function `list_to_float` takes a list of tuples as an argument. The input is `[("3", "4"), ("1", "26.45"), ("7.32", "8"), ("4", "8")]`.

The variable `res` is initialized to an empty list, which will store the resulting list of tuples with converted float values.

The function enters a loop that iterates over each tuple in the input list `test_list`.

For each tuple `tup`, a temporary list `temp` is created.

Another loop iterates over each element `ele` in the tuple `tup`.

If `ele` is an alphabetical character (checked using `ele.isalpha()`), it is appended to `temp` as is. However, since all elements in the tuples are numeric strings, this condition is never met.

If `ele` is not an alphabetical character, it is converted to a float and then appended to `temp`.

After processing both elements of the tuple, `temp` now contains two float values.

These float values are then used to create a new tuple, which is appended to the `res` list.

The process repeats for each tuple in the input list.

The final result is a list of tuples with the same structure as the input list, but with each string element converted to a float.

The expected output for the given input is:
`[("3", "4"), ("1", "26.45"), ("7.32", "8"), ("4", "8")]` becomes `[(3.0, 4.0), (1.0, 26.45), (7.32, 8.0), (4.0, 8.0)]`.

[(3.0, 4.0), (1.0, 26.45), (7.32, 8.0), (4.0, 8.0)]
