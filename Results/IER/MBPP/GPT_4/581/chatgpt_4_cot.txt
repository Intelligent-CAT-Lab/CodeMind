<<<Analysis>>>
The function `surface_Area` takes two arguments, `b` and `s`, which are initialized to 3 and 4, respectively.
The function calculates the surface area of a cube with a base of `b` and a side of `s`.
The formula used is `2 * b * s + pow(b,2)`.
First, it calculates `2 * b * s` which is `2 * 3 * 4` equal to 24.
Then, it calculates `pow(b,2)` which is `pow(3,2)` equal to 9.
Finally, it adds these two results together: `24 + 9` equals 33.
The function returns this value, which is the surface area of the cube.
<<<Output>>>
33
