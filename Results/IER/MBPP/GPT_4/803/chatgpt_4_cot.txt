<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_perfect_square is designed to check if a given number n is a perfect square.
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The variable i is initialized to 1, which will be used to check each number from 1 upwards to see if it is the square root of n.
The while loop will run as long as i * i is less than or equal to n.
The loop starts with i = 1, and 1 * 1 is 1, which is less than 10, so the loop continues.
The if condition checks if n is divisible by i without a remainder (n % i == 0) and if n divided by i is equal to i (n / i == i). For i = 1, 10 % 1 is 0, but 10 / 1 is 10, which is not equal to 1, so the condition is not met.
i is incremented to 2, and 2 * 2 is 4, which is less than 10, so the loop continues.
For i = 2, 10 % 2 is 0, but 10 / 2 is 5, which is not equal to 2, so the condition is not met.
i is incremented to 3, and 3 * 3 is 9, which is less than 10, so the loop continues.
For i = 3, 10 % 3 is 1, which is not 0, so the condition is not met.
i is incremented to 4, and 4 * 4 is 16, which is greater than 10, so the loop stops.
Since the loop has ended without returning True, the function returns False, indicating that 10 is not a perfect square.
