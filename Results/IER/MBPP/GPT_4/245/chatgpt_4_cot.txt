<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_sum` is designed to find the maximum sum of a subsequence in an array where the subsequence is increasing both from the start and from the end. The variable `arr` is initialized to `[1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]`.

The variable `MSIBS` (Max Sum Increasing from Beginning Subsequence) is initialized as a copy of `arr`. The first nested loop iterates over each element of `arr` and updates `MSIBS` such that `MSIBS[i]` holds the maximum sum of the increasing subsequence ending at `arr[i]`.

After the first nested loop, `MSIBS` will be `[1, 16, 67, 67, 67, 167, 67, 85, 67]`.

The variable `MSDBS` (Max Sum Decreasing from Back Subsequence) is also initialized as a copy of `arr`. The second nested loop iterates over each element of `arr` in reverse order and updates `MSDBS` such that `MSDBS[-i]` holds the maximum sum of the increasing subsequence starting at `arr[-i]`.

After the second nested loop, `MSDBS` will be `[252, 251, 236, 185, 140, 100, 29, 18, 9]`.

The variable `max_sum` is initialized to negative infinity. The final loop iterates over `MSIBS`, `MSDBS`, and `arr` simultaneously, and for each element, it calculates the sum of the corresponding elements from `MSIBS` and `MSDBS` and subtracts the current element of `arr` (since it is counted twice). It updates `max_sum` with the maximum value found.

The final `max_sum` after the loop will be `max_sum = max(252, 267, 302, 302, 302, 267, 94, 103, 67)`, which is `302`.
