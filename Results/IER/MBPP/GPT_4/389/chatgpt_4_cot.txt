The function `find_lucas` is a recursive function that calculates the nth Lucas number. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

The function is called with n = 9. The function will proceed as follows:

1. Since n is not 0 or 1, it calls itself with n-1 (8) and n-2 (7).
2. For n = 8, it is not 0 or 1, so it calls itself with n-1 (7) and n-2 (6).
3. This process continues, breaking down each call into smaller calls until it reaches the base cases where n is 0 or 1.
4. Once the base cases are reached, the function starts returning values back up the call stack, summing the results of the calls to `find_lucas(n - 1)` and `find_lucas(n - 2)` at each level.
5. The final sum of `find_lucas(1)` and `find_lucas(0)` is returned as the result for `find_lucas(2)`, and this process continues up the call stack.
6. The recursive calls build up the Lucas sequence: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, and so on.
7. The 9th Lucas number (considering the sequence starting from n=0) is 47.

Therefore, the return value of `find_lucas(9)` will be 47.
