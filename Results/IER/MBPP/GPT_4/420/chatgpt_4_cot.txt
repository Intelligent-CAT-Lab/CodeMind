<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of cubes of double the numbers from 1 to n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers 1 and 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the cube of double the number (2*i)^3 and adds it to sum.
When i is 1, (2*1)^3 = 8, so sum becomes 0 + 8 = 8.
When i is 2, (2*2)^3 = 64, so sum becomes 8 + 64 = 72.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum, which is 72.
<<<Output>>>
72
