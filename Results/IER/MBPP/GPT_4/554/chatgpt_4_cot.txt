<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Split` takes a list as an argument.
The variable `od_li` is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store odd numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element `i` in the input list `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`.
For each element `i`, the code checks if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., if it is an odd number).
If the condition is true (the number is odd), it appends the number `i` to the list `od_li`.
The numbers 1, 3, and 5 from the input list are odd and will be appended to `od_li`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the list `od_li`, which contains the odd numbers from the input list.
The final returned value will be `[1, 3, 5]`.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 5]
