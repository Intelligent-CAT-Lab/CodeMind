<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_of_nth` is designed to find the maximum value at the N-th index in a list of lists (sublists).
The variable `test_list` is initialized to `[[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]]`, and the variable `N` is initialized to `2`.
The list comprehension `[sub[N] for sub in test_list]` iterates over each sublist in `test_list` and extracts the element at index `N` (which is `2` in this case, corresponding to the third element in each sublist because Python uses 0-based indexing).
The elements extracted are `7`, `5`, and `19` from each of the sublists, respectively.
The `max` function is then called on this list of extracted elements, which results in finding the maximum value among `7`, `5`, and `19`.
The maximum value is `19`.
The function returns this maximum value, which is `19`.
