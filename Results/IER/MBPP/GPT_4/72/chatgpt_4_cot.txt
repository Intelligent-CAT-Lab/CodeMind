<<<Analysis>>>
The function `dif_Square` takes a single argument `n`, which is initialized to 5.
The function checks if `n` modulo 4 is not equal to 2. Since 5 modulo 4 is 1, which is not equal to 2, the condition is true.
Therefore, the function returns `True` without reaching the second return statement.
<<<Output>>>
True
