The function `divisible_by_digits` takes two arguments, `startnum` and `endnum`, which are initialized to 1 and 22, respectively.
The function returns a list comprehension that iterates over the range from `startnum` to `endnum` inclusive.
For each number `n` in this range, the list comprehension includes `n` if the following condition is met: none of the digits of `n` are zero and `n` is divisible by each of its non-zero digits.
The lambda function inside the `any` function checks two conditions for each digit `x` of the number `n`:
1. If `x` is '0', the number is not included in the list (since division by zero is not possible).
2. If `n` modulo `int(x)` is not equal to 0, meaning `n` is not divisible by the digit `x`, the number is not included in the list.
The `map` function applies this lambda function to each digit of `n` (converted to a string).
The `any` function checks if any of the conditions are True. If none are True (meaning `any` returns False), the number `n` is included in the list.
The numbers from 1 to 22 that meet this condition are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, and 22.
