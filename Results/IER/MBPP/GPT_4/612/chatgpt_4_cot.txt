<<<Analysis>>>
The function `merge` takes a list of lists as an argument. In this case, the input is `[['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]`.
The `zip` function is used with the unpacking operator `*` to unzip the list of lists. This effectively transposes the rows and columns.
The `zip` function will pair up the elements of the inner lists based on their index, resulting in an iterator of tuples where the first tuple contains all the first elements of the inner lists, the second tuple contains all the second elements, and so on.
For the given input, `zip(*lst)` will result in an iterator of tuples like `[('x', 'a', 'm'), ('y', 'b', 'n')]`.
The `list` function is then used to convert each tuple into a list, resulting in `[['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]`.
Finally, the outer list comprehension `[list(ele) for ele in list(zip(*lst))]` simply ensures that each tuple is converted to a list, but since we already did that in the previous step, it doesn't change the result.
The final result is a list of lists where the original columns are now rows.
<<<Output>>>
[['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]
