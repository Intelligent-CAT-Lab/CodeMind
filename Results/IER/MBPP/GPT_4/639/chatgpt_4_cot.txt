<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sample_nam` takes a list of strings as input and filters it using a lambda function. The lambda function checks for each element (name) in the list if the first character is uppercase and the rest of the characters are lowercase.
The input list is `['sally', 'Dylan', 'rebecca', 'Diana', 'Joanne', 'keith']`.
The filter function will iterate through each name in the list and apply the lambda function:
- 'sally' does not meet the condition because the first character is not uppercase.
- 'Dylan' does not meet the condition because not all characters after the first are lowercase.
- 'rebecca' does not meet the condition because the first character is not uppercase.
- 'Diana' meets the condition because the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.
- 'Joanne' meets the condition for the same reason as 'Diana'.
- 'keith' does not meet the condition because the first character is not uppercase.

After filtering, the list becomes `['Diana', 'Joanne']`.
The function then joins the filtered names into a single string 'DianaJoanne' and returns the length of this string.
The length of 'DianaJoanne' is 12.

12
