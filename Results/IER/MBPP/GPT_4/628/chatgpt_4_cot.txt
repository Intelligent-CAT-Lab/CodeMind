<<<Analysis>>>
The function `replace_spaces` takes a single argument, which is a string.
The string "My Name is Dawood" is passed to the function.
The function uses the `replace` method of the string object to replace all occurrences of a space " " with "%20".
The `replace` method will scan the input string and replace each space with "%20".
The resulting string will be "My%20Name%20is%20Dawood" after all spaces have been replaced.
The function then returns this new string.
<<<Output>>>
My%20Name%20is%20Dawood
