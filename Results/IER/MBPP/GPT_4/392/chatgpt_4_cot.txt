<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_max_sum` is designed to calculate the maximum sum of a number `n` and the sum of its parts when divided by 2, 3, 4, and 5, recursively. The function uses dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems in a list `res`.

1. The list `res` is initialized with two elements: `res[0] = 0` and `res[1] = 1`.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 2, which will be used to iterate from 2 to `n` (inclusive).
3. A while loop starts, which will run until `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
4. Inside the loop, the function calculates the maximum value between `i` and the sum of `res[int(i / 2)]`, `res[int(i / 3)]`, `res[int(i / 4)]`, and `res[int(i / 5)]`. This value is then appended to the list `res`.
5. The variable `i` is incremented by 1.
6. Once the loop is finished, the function returns the value of `res[n]`.

For `n = 60`, the function will calculate the maximum sum for all numbers from 2 to 60. Since the calculation is recursive and depends on previously calculated values, it will build up the `res` list with the maximum sums for each number. The final result will be the 60th element of the `res` list, which is the maximum sum for the number 60.

Calculating the exact value manually would be time-consuming and error-prone, as it involves a large number of recursive calculations. However, the function is designed to handle this efficiently through dynamic programming.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of `get_max_sum(60)` would be the 60th element in the `res` list, which is the result of the dynamic programming calculation. To get the exact value, the function would need to be executed in a Python environment.
