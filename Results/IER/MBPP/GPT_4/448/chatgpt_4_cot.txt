The variable n is initialized to 9.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 3, 0, and 2, respectively.
The function checks if n is 0, 1, or 2 and returns 3, 3, or 5, respectively, but since n is 9, it skips these conditions.
The variable sum is initialized to 5, which is the sum of the series up to n=2.
The code enters a while loop that will run as long as n is greater than 2.
Inside the loop, the following steps are performed:
- d is calculated as the sum of a and b (initially, d = 3 + 0 = 3).
- sum is updated by adding d to it (initially, sum = 5 + 3 = 8).
- The values of a, b, and c are updated to the values of b, c, and d, respectively (initially, a = 0, b = 2, c = 3).
- n is decremented by 1 (initially, n = 9 - 1 = 8).
The loop continues with the updated values of a, b, c, and n.
The sequence of updates will be as follows:
1st iteration: a=0, b=2, c=3, d=3, sum=8, n=8
2nd iteration: a=2, b=3, c=3, d=5, sum=13, n=7
3rd iteration: a=3, b=3, c=5, d=6, sum=19, n=6
4th iteration: a=3, b=5, c=6, d=8, sum=27, n=5
5th iteration: a=5, b=6, c=8, d=11, sum=38, n=4
6th iteration: a=6, b=8, c=11, d=14, sum=52, n=3
7th iteration: a=8, b=11, c=14, d=19, sum=71, n=2
Since n is now equal to 2, the loop stops.
The final value of sum is returned, which is 71.
