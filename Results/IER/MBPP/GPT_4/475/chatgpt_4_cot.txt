<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_counter` takes a dictionary `dict1` as an input.
The dictionary `{'Math':81, 'Physics':83, 'Chemistry':87}` is passed to the function.
The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to create a `Counter` object `x` from the input dictionary.
The `most_common()` method is called on the `Counter` object `x`. This method returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key from the dictionary and its corresponding value. The list is sorted in descending order based on the values.
In this case, the `most_common()` method will sort the subjects based on their scores, with the highest score first.
The sorted list of tuples is stored in the variable `sort_counter`.
The function returns the sorted list of tuples.
The expected output is a list of tuples sorted by the values in descending order: `[('Chemistry', 87), ('Physics', 83), ('Math', 81)]`.
<<<Output>>>
[('Chemistry', 87), ('Physics', 83), ('Math', 81)]
