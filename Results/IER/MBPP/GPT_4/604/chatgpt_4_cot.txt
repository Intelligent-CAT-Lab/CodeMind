<<<Analysis>>>
The function `reverse_words` takes a single string argument `s`.
The string `s` is "python program".
The `split()` method is called on `s`, which splits the string into a list of words based on spaces. The result is `['python', 'program']`.
The `reversed()` function is then called on this list, which returns an iterator that yields the elements of the list in reverse order. The result is `['program', 'python']`.
The `join()` method is called on a space character `' '`, which concatenates the elements of the reversed list into a single string with spaces between the words. The result is `"program python"`.
The function returns this final string.
<<<Output>>>
"program python"
