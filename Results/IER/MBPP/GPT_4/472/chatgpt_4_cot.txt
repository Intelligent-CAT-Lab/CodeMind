<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_Consecutive` takes a list `l` as an argument.
The list `l` is initialized to `[1,2,3,4,5]`.
The function sorts the list `l` and compares it to a range created from the minimum value of `l` to the maximum value of `l` plus one.
The sorted list is `[1,2,3,4,5]`.
The range created is `range(1, 6)`, which is equivalent to a list `[1,2,3,4,5]`.
Since the sorted list is equal to the list created from the range, the function will return `True`.
<<<Output>>>
True
