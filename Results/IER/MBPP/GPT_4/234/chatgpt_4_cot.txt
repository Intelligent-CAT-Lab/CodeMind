<<<Analysis>>>
The function volume_cube takes a single argument l, which represents the length of a side of a cube.
The variable l is initialized to 3.
The volume of the cube is calculated by cubing the length l, which is done by multiplying l by itself three times (l * l * l).
The calculated volume is 3 * 3 * 3, which equals 27.
The function then returns the calculated volume, which is 27.
<<<Output>>>
27
