<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h_age is initialized to 12.
The function first checks if h_age is less than 0, which it is not, so it does not exit.
Next, it checks if h_age is less than or equal to 2, which it is not, so it skips that block.
Since h_age is greater than 2, it proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, it calculates the dog's age in dog years for ages greater than 2. The formula is 21 (which accounts for the first two human years at 10.5 dog years each) plus 4 times the number of human years beyond the first two.
So, the calculation for a 12-year-old human is 21 + (12 - 2) * 4.
This simplifies to 21 + 10 * 4, which is 21 + 40.
Therefore, the dog's age in dog years is 61.
<<<Output>>>
61
