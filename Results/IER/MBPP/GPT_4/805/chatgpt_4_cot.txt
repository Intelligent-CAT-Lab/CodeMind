<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_sum_list` takes a list of lists as an argument.
The `max` function is used with the `key` argument set to `sum`, which means that the list with the greatest sum of its elements will be returned.
The sums of the lists are as follows:
- The sum of [1,2,3] is 6.
- The sum of [4,5,6] is 15.
- The sum of [10,11,12] is 33.
- The sum of [7,8,9] is 24.
The list with the greatest sum is [10,11,12] with a sum of 33.
Therefore, the function will return the list [10,11,12].
<<<Output>>>
[10, 11, 12]
