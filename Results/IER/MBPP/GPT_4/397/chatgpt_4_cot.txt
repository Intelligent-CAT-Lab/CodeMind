<<<Analysis>>>
The function `median_numbers` takes three arguments: a, b, and c, which are initialized to 25, 55, and 65, respectively.
The function aims to find the median of the three numbers, which is the number that would be in the middle if they were sorted.

The first condition checks if a > b, which is false since 25 is not greater than 55. Therefore, the code moves to the else block.

In the else block, the first condition checks if a > c, which is also false since 25 is not greater than 65.

The next condition in the else block checks if b < c, which is true since 55 is less than 65.

Since the condition b < c is true, the median is assigned the value of b, which is 55.

The function then returns the value of median, which is 55.

<<<Output>>>
55
