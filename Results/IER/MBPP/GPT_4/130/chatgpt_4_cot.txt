<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_occurrences` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the number that occurs the most times in the list.
- A `defaultdict` of type `int` is created to store the occurrences of each number.
- The function iterates over the input list `nums` and for each number `i`, it increments the count in the dictionary `dict`.
- After the loop, the dictionary `dict` contains the following key-value pairs representing the number and its count:
  - 1: 3
  - 2: 5
  - 3: 2
  - 4: 2
  - 5: 1
  - 6: 3
  - 7: 1
  - 8: 2
  - 9: 2
- The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the dictionary based on the count (the second element of the tuple returned by `dict.items()`). The `key` argument is a lambda function that specifies the element to compare (the count of occurrences).
- The number with the maximum occurrences is 2, which occurs 5 times.
- The function returns the number with the maximum occurrences, which is the first element of the result tuple.
