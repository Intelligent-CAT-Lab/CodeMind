<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_Diff takes an integer n as its argument.
The function checks if the given number n is divisible by 11 without any remainder.
The input number 12345 is passed to the function.
The function calculates 12345 % 11, which is the remainder of 12345 divided by 11.
The remainder of 12345 divided by 11 is 3, which is not equal to 0.
Since the remainder is not 0, the condition (n % 11 == 0) is False.
Therefore, the function will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
