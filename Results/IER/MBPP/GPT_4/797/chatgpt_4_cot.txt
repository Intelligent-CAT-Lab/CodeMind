<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_in_range` takes two arguments, `l` and `r`, which are initialized to 2 and 5, respectively.
The function `sum_odd` calculates the sum of the first `n` odd numbers by using the formula `terms * terms`, where `terms` is `(n + 1)//2`.
First, `sum_in_range` calls `sum_odd(r)` with `r` being 5. This calculates the sum of the first 5 odd numbers:
- `terms` for `r` is `(5 + 1)//2`, which is `3`.
- The sum of the first 5 odd numbers is `3 * 3`, which is `9`.
Next, `sum_in_range` calls `sum_odd(l - 1)` with `l - 1` being `1` (since `l` is 2). This calculates the sum of the first 1 odd number:
- `terms` for `l - 1` is `(1 + 1)//2`, which is `1`.
- The sum of the first 1 odd number is `1 * 1`, which is `1`.
Finally, `sum_in_range` returns the difference between the sum of the first 5 odd numbers and the sum of the first 1 odd number, which is `9 - 1`, resulting in `8`.
