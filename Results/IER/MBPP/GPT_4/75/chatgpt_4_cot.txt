The variable test_list is initialized to [(6, 24, 12), (7, 9, 6), (12, 18, 21)], and the variable K is initialized to 6.
The function find_tuples is defined to take a list of tuples and an integer K, and return a list of tuples where all elements in each tuple are divisible by K.
The list comprehension iterates over each tuple (sub) in test_list.
For each tuple, the inner generator expression checks if all elements (ele) in the tuple are divisible by K (ele % K == 0).
The first tuple (6, 24, 12) passes the check since all elements are divisible by 6.
The second tuple (7, 9, 6) does not pass the check because 7 and 9 are not divisible by 6.
The third tuple (12, 18, 21) does not pass the check because 21 is not divisible by 6.
The result (res) will be a list containing only the tuples that passed the check, which in this case is only the first tuple.
The function returns the list containing the single tuple [(6, 24, 12)].
<<<Output>>>
[(6, 24, 12)]
