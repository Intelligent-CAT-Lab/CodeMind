<<<Analysis>>>
The function `extract_quotation` is defined with one parameter `text1`.
The function uses the `re.findall` method from the `re` (regular expression) module to find all substrings that match the given pattern.
The pattern `r'"(.*?)"'` is a regular expression that matches any sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes. The `.*?` is a non-greedy match for any sequence of characters, and the parentheses capture the matched text without the quotes.
The input string `'Cortex "A53" Based "multi" tasking "Processor"'` is passed to the function.
The `re.findall` method will find all matches of the pattern in the input string. It will match `"A53"`, `"multi"`, and `"Processor"` without including the double quotes.
The function will return a list of the matched substrings: `['A53', 'multi', 'Processor']`.
<<<Output>>>
['A53', 'multi', 'Processor']
