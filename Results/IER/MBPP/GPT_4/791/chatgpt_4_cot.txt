<<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_nested` is designed to take a tuple `test_tup` and return a new tuple that contains only the non-tuple elements from the original tuple.

The variable `res` is initialized to an empty tuple, which will be used to accumulate the non-tuple elements.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over `test_tup` with both the index and the element itself (`count` and `ele`).

For each element `ele` in `test_tup`, the code checks if the element is not an instance of a tuple using `isinstance(ele, tuple)`. If the element is not a tuple, it is added to the `res` tuple.

The input tuple is `(1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)`. The loop will process each element as follows:
- 1 is not a tuple, so it is added to `res`, making `res` now `(1,)`.
- 5 is not a tuple, so it is added to `res`, making `res` now `(1, 5)`.
- 7 is not a tuple, so it is added to `res`, making `res` now `(1, 5, 7)`.
- (4, 6) is a tuple, so it is not added to `res`.
- 10 is not a tuple, so it is added to `res`, making `res` now `(1, 5, 7, 10)`.

After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `res`, which is `(1, 5, 7, 10)`.

(1, 5, 7, 10)
