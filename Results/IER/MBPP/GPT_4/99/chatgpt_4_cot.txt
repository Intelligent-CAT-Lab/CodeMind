<<<Analysis>>>
The function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer n as its argument.
The built-in Python function `bin` is used to convert the integer n to its binary representation as a string.
The binary representation returned by `bin` includes the prefix '0b', which indicates that the following digits are in binary format.
The `replace` method is then used to remove the '0b' prefix from the string, leaving only the binary digits.
For the input `decimal_to_binary(8)`, the `bin` function will return '0b1000'.
The `replace` method will then remove the '0b' prefix, resulting in '1000'.
<<<Output>>>
1000
