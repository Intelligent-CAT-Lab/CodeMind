<<<Analysis>>>
The function `first_repeated_char` is designed to find the first character in a string that is repeated.
The input string "abcabc" is passed to the function.
The function iterates over each character in the string along with its index.
For each character, it checks the count of that character in the substring that includes all characters up to and including the current one.
The loop starts with index 0 and character 'a'. The substring "a" has the character 'a' only once, so it continues.
Next, index 1 and character 'b'. The substring "ab" has the character 'b' only once, so it continues.
Next, index 2 and character 'c'. The substring "abc" has the character 'c' only once, so it continues.
Next, index 3 and character 'a'. The substring "abca" has the character 'a' twice, which satisfies the condition.
The function returns the character 'a' as it is the first repeated character in the string.
<<<Output>>>
a
