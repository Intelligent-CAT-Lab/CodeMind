<<<Analysis>>>
The function `large_product` takes three arguments: two lists of numbers (`nums1` and `nums2`) and an integer `N`.
The function computes the product of each pair of numbers where one number is taken from `nums1` and the other from `nums2`.
The resulting products are: 
1*3, 1*6, 1*8, 1*9, 1*10, 1*6, 
2*3, 2*6, 2*8, 2*9, 2*10, 2*6, 
3*3, 3*6, 3*8, 3*9, 3*10, 3*6, 
4*3, 4*6, 4*8, 4*9, 4*10, 4*6, 
5*3, 5*6, 5*8, 5*9, 5*10, 5*6, 
6*3, 6*6, 6*8, 6*9, 6*10, 6*6.

These products are then sorted in descending order.
The sorted list is: 
60, 60, 60, 60, 54, 54, 50, 50, 48, 48, 48, 45, 45, 40, 40, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 24, 24, 24, 24, 20, 20, 20, 20, 18, 18, 18, 18, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 10, 10, 9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 6.

Finally, the function returns the first `N` elements from the sorted list, where `N` is 3.
The first 3 elements are 60, 60, and 60.
