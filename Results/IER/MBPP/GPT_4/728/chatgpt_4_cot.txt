<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_list` takes two lists as input, `lst1` and `lst2`.
The lists provided as input are `[10,20,30]` and `[15,25,35]`.
The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list `res_list`.
The list comprehension iterates over the indices of `lst1` using `range(len(lst1))`, which is equivalent to `range(3)` since `lst1` has 3 elements.
For each index `i`, the corresponding elements from `lst1` and `lst2` are added together and appended to `res_list`.
The operation is performed for each pair of elements: 10+15, 20+25, and 30+35.
The resulting list is `[25, 45, 65]`.
The function returns this list.
<<<Output>>>
[25, 45, 65]
