<<<Analysis>>>
The function `tuple_intersection` takes two lists of tuples as input and returns a set containing the intersection of these lists after sorting each tuple.

1. The input lists are `[(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)]` and `[(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)]`.
2. The function creates a set from the first list by sorting each tuple and converting them to tuples again. The sorted tuples are `(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)`. After sorting, the set is `{(3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (9, 10)}`.
3. The function then creates a set from the second list in the same way. The sorted tuples are `(4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 11)`. After sorting, the set is `{(3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (9, 11)}`.
4. The intersection of these two sets is calculated using the `&` operator. The intersection is `{(3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)}`.
5. The function returns this set as the result.

<<<Output>>>
{(3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)}
