<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_Volume` takes three arguments: l, b, and h, which represent length, breadth, and height, respectively.
The values of l, b, and h are initialized to 10, 8, and 6, respectively.
The function calculates the volume by multiplying l, b, and h together and then dividing the result by 2.
The calculation is as follows: (10 * 8 * 6) / 2 = 480 / 2 = 240.
The function returns the result of this calculation.
<<<Output>>>
240
