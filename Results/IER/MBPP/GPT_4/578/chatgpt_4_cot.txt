<<<Analysis>>>
The function `interleave_lists` takes three lists as input: list1, list2, and list3.
The lists provided as input are `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`, `[10,20,30,40,50,60,70]`, and `[100,200,300,400,500,600,700]`.
The function uses a list comprehension that includes a `zip` function to interleave the elements of the three lists.
The `zip` function takes multiple iterable objects and returns an iterator of tuples where each tuple contains the i-th element from each of the iterables.
The list comprehension iterates over the tuples produced by `zip` and for each tuple, it extends the result list with the elements of the tuple.
Since all three lists are of the same length, `zip` will combine them element-wise without any truncation.
The resulting list will be `[1, 10, 100, 2, 20, 200, 3, 30, 300, 4, 40, 400, 5, 50, 500, 6, 60, 600, 7, 70, 700]`.
