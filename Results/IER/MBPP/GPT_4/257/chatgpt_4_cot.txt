<<<Analysis>>>
The function `swap_numbers` is designed to swap the values of two variables, `a` and `b`.
Initially, `a` is set to 10 and `b` is set to 20.
A temporary variable `temp` is introduced to hold the value of `a`, which is 10.
The value of `b` (which is 20) is then assigned to `a`.
The value stored in `temp` (which is the original value of `a`, 10) is assigned to `b`.
The function returns a tuple with the new values of `a` and `b`, which are now 20 and 10, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
(20, 10)
