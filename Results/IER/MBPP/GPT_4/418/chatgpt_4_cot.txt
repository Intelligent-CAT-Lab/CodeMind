<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Find_Max` is designed to find the maximum element in a list. The input list is `[['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]`.
The `max` function is used with a generator expression `(x) for x in lst` to iterate over the elements of the list `lst`.
The elements of the list `lst` are themselves lists of varying lengths containing strings.
The `max` function, when used on lists of strings, compares the lists lexicographically. This means that the list with the string that comes last in lexicographic order will be considered the maximum.
In this case, the list `['A','B','C']` will be considered the maximum because it contains the string 'C', which comes after 'A' and 'B' in lexicographic order.
Therefore, the function will return `['A','B','C']` as the maximum list.
<<<Output>>>
['A', 'B', 'C']
