<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_K` takes a tuple `test_tup` and an integer `K` as its arguments. The tuple `test_tup` is initialized to (10, 4, 5, 6, 8), and `K` is initialized to 6.
The variable `res` is initialized to `False`, which will be used to store the result of the check.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element `ele` in `test_tup`.
For each element `ele`, the code checks if `ele` is equal to `K`.
If an element equal to `K` is found, `res` is set to `True` and the loop is immediately exited with a `break` statement.
In this case, when the loop reaches the element 6, it finds that it is equal to `K` (which is also 6), so `res` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.
After the loop, the function returns the value of `res`, which is `True`.
