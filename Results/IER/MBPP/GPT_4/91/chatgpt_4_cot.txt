<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_substring` takes two arguments: `str1`, which is a list of strings, and `sub_str`, which is a string that we want to find within the strings of the list.
The function uses a generator expression within the `any` function to iterate over each string `s` in the list `str1`.
For each string `s`, the expression `sub_str in s` checks if the substring `sub_str` is present in `s`.
The `any` function returns `True` as soon as it finds an element in the generator that evaluates to `True`. In this case, it is looking for any case where the substring "ack" is found within any of the strings in the list `str1`.
The substring "ack" is found in the string "black", which is the second element of the list.
Since "ack" is found in "black", the `any` function will return `True`.
If the substring was not found in any of the strings, the `any` function would return `False`, but that is not the case here.
Therefore, the function `find_substring` will return `True`.
