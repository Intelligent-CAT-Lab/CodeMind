<<<Analysis>>>
The function `two_unique_nums` takes a list `nums` as input.
The input list is `[1,2,3,2,3,4,5]`.
The function returns a list comprehension that iterates over each element `i` in `nums`.
For each element `i`, the function checks if the count of `i` in `nums` is equal to 1 using `nums.count(i) == 1`.
If the count is equal to 1, it means that the element appears only once in the list, and it is included in the output list.
The elements that appear only once in the input list are 1, 4, and 5.
Therefore, the function will return the list `[1, 4, 5]`.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 5]
