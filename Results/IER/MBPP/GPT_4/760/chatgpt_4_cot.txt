<<<Analysis>>>
The function `unique_Element` takes a list `arr` as an input.
The list `[1,1,1]` is passed to the function.
A set `s` is created from the list, which removes any duplicate elements. Since all elements in the list are the same (1), the set `s` will contain a single element `{1}`.
The function then checks if the length of the set `s` is equal to 1.
Since the set `s` contains only one unique element, the length is indeed 1.
Therefore, the condition `len(s) == 1` evaluates to `True`.
<<<Output>>>
True
