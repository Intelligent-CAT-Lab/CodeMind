<<<Analysis>>>
The function `square_nums` takes a list of numbers as an argument.
The list of numbers provided as input is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
The function uses the `map` function along with a lambda function to apply the square operation (`x ** 2`) to each element in the list.
The `map` function returns an iterator that is then converted into a list using the `list` function.
The lambda function squares each number in the list, resulting in a new list where each number is the square of the original numbers.
The squared numbers are `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]`.
The function returns this new list of squared numbers.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
