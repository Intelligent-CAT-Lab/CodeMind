<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_expression` is designed to check if the input string `exp` is a valid expression with balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces.

1. The input string is "{()}[{}]".
2. The function first checks if the length of the input string is odd using `len(exp) & 1`. If it is odd, it immediately returns `False` because an odd number of characters cannot form a balanced expression. In this case, the length is even (8 characters), so the function proceeds.
3. A `deque` (double-ended queue) named `stack` is initialized to keep track of the opening brackets.
4. The function then iterates over each character `ch` in the input string.
5. For each character, it checks if it is an opening bracket ('(', '{', or '['). If it is, it appends the character to the `stack`.
6. If the character is a closing bracket (')', '}', or ']'), the function checks if the `stack` is empty. If it is empty, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket, and the function returns `False`.
7. If the `stack` is not empty, the function pops the top element from the `stack` and checks if it matches the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If it does not match, the function returns `False`.
8. After the loop, the function returns `True` if the `stack` is empty, meaning all opening brackets had matching closing brackets. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Let's go through the input string "{()}[{}]":
- '{' is an opening bracket, so it is added to the `stack`.
- '(' is an opening bracket, so it is added to the `stack`.
- ')' is a closing bracket, the top of the `stack` is '(', which matches, so it is popped from the `stack`.
- '}' is a closing bracket, the top of the `stack` is '{', which matches, so it is popped from the `stack`.
- '[' is an opening bracket, so it is added to the `stack`.
- '{' is an opening bracket, so it is added to the `stack`.
- '}' is a closing bracket, the top of the `stack` is '{', which matches, so it is popped from the `stack`.
- ']' is a closing bracket, the top of the `stack` is '[', which matches, so it is popped from the `stack`.

At the end of the iteration, the `stack` is empty, indicating that all opening brackets had matching closing brackets and were properly nested.
