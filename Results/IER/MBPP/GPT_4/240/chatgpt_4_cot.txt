<<<Analysis>>>
The function `replace_list` takes two lists as input: `list1` and `list2`.
The input for `list1` is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]` and for `list2` is `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
The code `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. The slice `[-1:]` refers to the last element of `list1` onwards, which in this case is just the last element `[10]`.
After the replacement, `list1` becomes `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.
The variable `replace_list` is assigned the value of `list1`.
The function returns `replace_list`, which is now `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.

[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]
