<<<Analysis>>>
The function `even_binomial_Coeff_Sum` takes a single argument `n`, which is initialized to 4.
The function returns the result of the expression `(1 << (n - 1))`.
The expression uses the bitwise left shift operator `<<`. This operator shifts the bits of the number on the left (which is 1 in this case) to the left by the number of positions specified by the number on the right (which is `n - 1` in this case).
For `n = 4`, the expression becomes `(1 << (4 - 1))`, which simplifies to `(1 << 3)`.
The number 1 in binary is `0b1`. Shifting it to the left by 3 positions results in `0b1000`.
`0b1000` in binary is equal to 8 in decimal.
Therefore, the function will return 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
