<<<Analysis>>>
The function `lateralsurface_cube` takes one argument `l`, which represents the length of the side of a cube.
The variable `l` is initialized to 5.
The lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube is calculated using the formula LSA = 4 * (l * l).
The code calculates the lateral surface area by squaring the length of the side (5 * 5) and then multiplying the result by 4.
The calculation is as follows: 4 * (5 * 5) = 4 * 25 = 100.
The function returns the calculated lateral surface area, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
