<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_first_occurrence` is designed to find the first occurrence of an element `x` in a sorted list `A` using a binary search algorithm.

The list `A` is `[2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` and the element `x` we are looking for is `5`.

1. Initialize `left` to `0` and `right` to `len(A) - 1`, which is `9`.
2. Initialize `result` to `-1`, which will store the index of the first occurrence of `x` if it is found.
3. Enter the while loop since `left` (0) is less than or equal to `right` (9).
4. Calculate `mid` as `(left + right) // 2`, which is `(0 + 9) // 2 = 4`.
5. Check if `x` is equal to `A[mid]`. Since `A[4]` is `6`, the condition is false.
6. Since `x` (5) is less than `A[mid]` (6), update `right` to `mid - 1`, which is `3`.
7. The while loop continues because `left` (0) is still less than or equal to `right` (3).
8. Calculate the new `mid` as `(0 + 3) // 2 = 1`.
9. Check if `x` is equal to `A[mid]`. Since `A[1]` is `5`, the condition is true.
10. Update `result` to `mid`, which is `1`.
11. Update `right` to `mid - 1`, which is `0`.
12. The while loop continues because `left` (0) is still less than or equal to `right` (0).
13. Calculate the new `mid` as `(0 + 0) // 2 = 0`.
14. Check if `x` is equal to `A[mid]`. Since `A[0]` is `2`, the condition is false.
15. Since `x` (5) is greater than `A[mid]` (2), update `left` to `mid + 1`, which is `1`.
16. The while loop ends because `left` (1) is now greater than `right` (0).

The first occurrence of `x` (5) in the list `A` is at index `1`, and this is the value stored in `result`.
