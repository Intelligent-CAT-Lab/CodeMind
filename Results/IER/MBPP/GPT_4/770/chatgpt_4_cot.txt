The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable j is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the current odd number.
The variable sm is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the fourth powers of the odd numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider the first 2 odd numbers.
For each iteration i, the code calculates the current odd number by the formula j = (2*i-1) and then adds its fourth power to sm.
For i = 1, j = (2*1-1) = 1, and sm = sm + (1^4) = 0 + 1 = 1.
For i = 2, j = (2*2-1) = 3, and sm = sm + (3^4) = 1 + 81 = 82.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sm, which is 82.
