The function `remove_Occ` takes two arguments, a string `s` and a character `ch`. It is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of `ch` from `s`.

1. The string `s` is initialized to "hello" and the character `ch` is initialized to "l".
2. The first `for` loop iterates over the indices of `s`. When it finds the first occurrence of `ch`, it removes that character from `s` and breaks out of the loop. In this case, it will remove the first "l" from "hello", resulting in the string "helo".
3. The second `for` loop iterates over the indices of the modified `s` in reverse order. When it finds the first occurrence of `ch` (which is now the last occurrence in the original string), it removes that character from `s` and breaks out of the loop. In this case, it will remove the last "l" from "helo", resulting in the string "heo".
4. The function returns the modified string, which is "heo".
