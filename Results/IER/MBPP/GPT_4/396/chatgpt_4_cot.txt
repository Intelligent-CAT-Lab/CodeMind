<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_char` takes a string as input and checks it against a regular expression pattern defined by `regex`.
The `regex` pattern `'^[a-z]$|^([a-z]).*\1$'` is designed to match a string that either:
1. Consists of a single lowercase letter (`^[a-z]$`), or
2. Starts and ends with the same lowercase letter (`^([a-z]).*\1$`).

The input string "abba" is passed to the `check_char` function.
The regular expression is applied to "abba" using `re.search`.
The pattern `^([a-z]).*\1$` matches the string "abba" because it starts and ends with the same letter 'a'.
Since the pattern matches, `re.search` returns a match object, which evaluates to True in the if condition.
Therefore, the function returns "Valid".
