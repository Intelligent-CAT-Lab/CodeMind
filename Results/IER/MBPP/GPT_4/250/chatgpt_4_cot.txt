<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_X` is designed to count the occurrences of a value `x` in a tuple `tup`.
The tuple `tup` is initialized to (10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), and the value `x` is initialized to 4.
The variable `count` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of occurrences of `x`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element `ele` in the tuple `tup`.
For each element, it checks if `ele` is equal to `x`. If it is, it increments the `count` by 1.
Since `x` is 4 and there are no elements in the tuple equal to 4, the count remains 0.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `count`, which is 0.
