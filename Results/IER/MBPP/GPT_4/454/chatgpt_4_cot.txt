<<<Analysis>>>
The function `text_match_wordz` is defined with one parameter `text`.
The variable `patterns` is initialized to the regular expression string '\w*z.\w*'.
This pattern is looking for a match in the given text where:
- \w* means any word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _) zero or more times
- z is the literal character 'z'
- . means any character except a newline
- \w* again means any word character zero or more times
The `re.search` function is used to search for the pattern in the given text "pythonz.".
The text "pythonz." does match the pattern because it contains a 'z' followed by any character (in this case, a period '.') and then zero or more word characters (there are none after the period in this case).
Since the pattern is found in the text, `re.search` returns a match object, which evaluates to True.
Therefore, the function will return True.
