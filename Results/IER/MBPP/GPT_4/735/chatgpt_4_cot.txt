The variable n is initialized to 9.
The function `toggle_middle_bits` is called with n = 9.
Since n is not equal to 1, the function proceeds to call `set_middle_bits(9)`.

In `set_middle_bits(9)`:
- n is initially 9 (binary: 1001).
- n |= n >> 1 performs a bitwise OR between n and n shifted right by 1 bit. n becomes 1001 | 0100 = 1101.
- n |= n >> 2 performs a bitwise OR between n and n shifted right by 2 bits. n becomes 1101 | 0011 = 1111.
- n |= n >> 4 performs a bitwise OR between n and n shifted right by 4 bits. Since n is only 4 bits, shifting by 4 results in 0, so n remains 1111.
- n |= n >> 8 and n |= n >> 16 have no effect since n is less than 256 and 65536, respectively.
- Finally, (n >> 1) ^ 1 calculates n shifted right by 1 bit (which is 0111) and then performs a bitwise XOR with 1 (binary: 0001). The result is 0111 ^ 0001 = 0110 (binary), which is 6 in decimal.

Back in `toggle_middle_bits(9)`:
- The function now performs n ^ set_middle_bits(n), which is 9 ^ 6.
- In binary, this is 1001 ^ 0110 = 1111.

The return value of `toggle_middle_bits(9)` is therefore 15 in decimal.
