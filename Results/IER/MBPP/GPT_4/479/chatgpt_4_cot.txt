<<<Analysis>>>
The function first_Digit is designed to return the first digit of a given number n.
The input number n is initialized to 123.
The function enters a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than or equal to 10.
During the first iteration, n is 123, which is greater than 10, so the loop continues.
n is divided by 10, resulting in n becoming 12.3.
In the next iteration, n is still greater than 10, so the loop continues.
n is divided by 10 again, resulting in n becoming 1.23.
Now, n is less than 10, so the loop terminates.
The function returns the integer part of n, which is 1.
