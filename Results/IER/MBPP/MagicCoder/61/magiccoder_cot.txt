I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Output>>>

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from collections import defaultdict
def count_Substrings(s):
    n = len(s)
    count,sum = 0,0
    mp = defaultdict(lambda : 0)
    mp[0] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        sum += ord(s[i]) - ord('0')
        count += mp[sum - (i + 1)]
        mp[sum - (i + 1)] += 1
    return count

<<<Analysis>>>
The function count_Substrings takes a string s as input. The length of the string is stored in the variable n.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of substrings.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to calculate the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the string.
The defaultdict mp is used to store the frequency of the sum - (i + 1) for each i in the range of n.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each index i in this range, it calculates the ASCII value of the character at index i in the string and subtracts the ASCII value of '0' to get the integer value of the character. This value is then added to sum.
The function then adds the frequency of sum - (i + 1) to count.
The frequency of sum - (i + 1) is then incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the function prints the final value of count, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
