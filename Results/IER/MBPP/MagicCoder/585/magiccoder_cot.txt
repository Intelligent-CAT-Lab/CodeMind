I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
  expensive_items = heapq.nlargest(n, items, key=lambda s: s['price'])
  return expensive_items
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`expensive_items([{'name': 'Item-1', 'price': 101.1},{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}],1)`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function expensive_items takes a list of dictionaries items and an integer n as input. The function uses the heapq library to find the n largest items in the list based on the 'price' key in the dictionary.

The function heapq.nlargest(n, iterable, key=None) returns a list with the n largest elements from the dataset defined by iterable. The key parameter should be a function that serves as a key to extract a comparison key from each element in iterable (for example, if iterable is a list of dictionaries, you can use key=lambda s: s['price'] to get the 'price' of each dictionary).

In this case, the function is called with the list of dictionaries [{'name': 'Item-1', 'price': 101.1},{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}] and n=1. The function will return the dictionary with the highest price, which is {'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}.
<<<Output>>>
[{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}]
