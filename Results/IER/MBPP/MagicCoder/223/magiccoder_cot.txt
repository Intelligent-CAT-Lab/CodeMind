I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_majority(arr, n, x):
	i = binary_search(arr, 0, n-1, x)
	if i == -1:
		return False
	if ((i + n//2) <= (n -1)) and arr[i + n//2] == x:
		return True
	else:
		return False
def binary_search(arr, low, high, x):
	if high >= low:
		mid = (low + high)//2 
		if (mid == 0 or x > arr[mid-1]) and (arr[mid] == x):
			return mid
		elif x > arr[mid]:
			return binary_search(arr, (mid + 1), high, x)
		else:
			return binary_search(arr, low, (mid -1), x)
	return -1

What would be the return value of`is_majority([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10], 7, 3)`?

The function is_majority takes an array arr, its length n, and an element x as input. It first calls the binary_search function to find the index of x in the array. If x is not present in the array, the function returns False. If x is present, it checks if the element at index i + n//2 is also x. If it is, the function returns True, indicating that x is a majority element. If not, it returns False.

The binary_search function takes an array arr, the starting index low, the ending index high, and an element x as input. It first checks if the high index is greater than or equal to the low index. If it is, it calculates the mid index and checks if the element at the mid index is x. If it is, it returns the mid index. If x is greater than the element at the mid index, it calls the binary_search function recursively with the mid index + 1 as the low index and the high index. If x is less than the element at the mid index, it calls the binary_search function recursively with the low index and the mid index - 1. If the element is not found, it returns -1.

In the given example, the array is [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10] and the element is 3. The binary_search function finds the index of 3 in the array, which is 2. The is_majority function checks if the element at index 2 + 3//2 (which is 3) is also 3. Since it is, the function returns True.
