I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

            z.remove(y)
            z.sort()
            nums[i:] = [y] + z
            return int("".join(nums))

<<<Analysis>>>
The function rearrange_bigger takes an integer n as input. It converts the integer into a list of digits and stores it in nums.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from the second last digit to the first digit.
For each digit i in this range, it checks if the digit to its right is smaller than it. If it is, it continues to the next step.
If the condition is not met, it returns False.
If the condition is met, it creates a new list z that includes all digits from i to the end of nums. It then finds the smallest digit in z that is greater than the first digit of z and removes it from z. It sorts z in ascending order and replaces the digits from i to the end of nums with z.
Finally, it returns the integer formed by joining the digits in nums.
