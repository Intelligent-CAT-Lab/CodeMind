I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_sublist(l, s):
	sub_set = False
	if s == []:
		sub_set = True
	elif s == l:
		sub_set = True
	elif len(s) > len(l):
		sub_set = False
	else:
		for i in range(len(l)):
			if l[i] == s[0]:
				n = 1
				while (n < len(s)) and (l[i+n] == s[n]):
					n += 1				
				if n == len(s):
					sub_set = True
	return sub_set

What would be the return value of`is_sublist([2,4,3,5,7],[3,7])`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_sublist takes two lists as input, l and s. It checks if list s is a sublist of list l.
The function first checks if s is an empty list, if it is, it returns True because any list is a sublist of an empty list.
Then it checks if s is equal to l, if it is, it returns True because l is a sublist of l.
Then it checks if the length of s is greater than the length of l, if it is, it returns False because a list cannot be a sublist of a list of smaller length.
If none of the above conditions are met, it enters a loop that iterates over the elements of l.
If it finds an element that is equal to the first element of s, it then checks if the rest of the elements in l match the rest of s. If they do, it returns True, meaning s is a sublist of l.
If it doesn't find a match, it continues to the next element in l.
If it goes through all the elements in l without finding a match, it returns False, meaning s is not a sublist of l.
<<<Output>>>
False
