You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:

def find_Odd_Pair(A,N) : 
    oddPair = 0
    for i in range(0,N) :  
        for j in range(i+1,N) :  
            if ((A[i] ^ A[j]) % 2 != 0):  
                oddPair+=1  
    return oddPair

What would be the return value of`find_Odd_Pair([5,4,7,2,1],5)`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function find_Odd_Pair takes two parameters: A, which is a list of integers, and N, which is the length of the list.
The function initializes a variable oddPair to 0. This variable will be used to count the number of pairs of elements in the list that have an odd XOR (exclusive OR) value.
The function then enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over the indices of the list, and the inner loop iterates over the remaining indices of the list.
For each pair of indices (i, j), where i < j, the function calculates the XOR of the elements at those indices. If the XOR is odd (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is not 0), the function increments oddPair.
After the loops finish, the function returns the value of oddPair.
