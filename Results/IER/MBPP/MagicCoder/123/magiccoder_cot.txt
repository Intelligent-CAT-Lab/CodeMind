I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def amicable_numbers_sum(limit):
    if not isinstance(limit, int):
        return "Input is not an integer!"
    if limit < 1:
        return "Input must be bigger than 0!"
    amicables = set()
    for num in range(2, limit+1):
        if num in amicables:
            continue
        sum_fact = sum([fact for fact in range(1, num) if num % fact == 0])
        sum_fact2 = sum([fact for fact in range(1, sum_fact) if sum_fact % fact == 0])
        if num == sum_fact2 and num != sum_fact:
            amicables.add(num)
            amicables.add(sum_fact2)
    return sum(amicables)

<<<Analysis>>>
The function amicable_numbers_sum takes an integer limit as input. It first checks if the input is an integer and if it is bigger than 0. If not, it returns an error message.
It then initializes an empty set amicables to store the amicable numbers.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to limit (inclusive). For each number num in this range, it calculates the sum of its factors (fact) and stores it in sum_fact.
Then it calculates the sum of the factors of sum_fact and stores it in sum_fact2.
If num is equal to sum_fact2 and num is not equal to sum_fact, it adds num and sum_fact2 to the set amicables.
After the loop finishes, it returns the sum of the elements in the set amicables.
