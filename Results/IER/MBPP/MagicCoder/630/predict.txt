The function get_coordinates takes a tuple as an argument. The tuple contains two elements, the first being the number of elements in the list and the second being the maximum value of the elements in the list.

The function adjac is a generator function that generates all possible combinations of numbers that can be formed by adding -1, 0, or 1 to each element in the tuple.

The function get_coordinates calls the adjac function with the tuple as an argument and returns the list of all possible combinations.

For example, if the input is (3, 4), the function will generate all possible combinations of numbers that can be formed by adding -1, 0, or 1 to each element in the tuple. The combinations will be in the form of a list of lists.
