@@ Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

def divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):

                if not any(map(lambda x: int(x) == 0 or n%int(x) != 0, str(n)))]

@@ Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function divisible_by_digits takes two arguments, startnum and endnum. It returns a list of numbers from startnum to endnum (inclusive) that are divisible by all of their digits.

The function uses a list comprehension to generate the list of numbers. The condition in the list comprehension checks each number n in the range from startnum to endnum (inclusive) to see if it is divisible by all of its digits.

The condition uses the any function to check if any digit of the number is 0 or if the number is not divisible by the digit. If the number is divisible by all of its digits, it is included in the list.

The function uses the map function to apply the lambda function to each digit of the number. The lambda function checks if the digit is 0 or if the number is not divisible by the digit.

The function uses the str function to convert the number to a string so that it can be iterated over its digits.

The function uses the range function to generate the list of numbers from startnum to endnum.

The function uses the not operator to invert the result of the any function, so that it returns True if the number is divisible by all of its digits and False otherwise.

The function uses the if condition to include the number in the list if it is divisible by all of its digits.

The function uses the list comprehension to generate the list of numbers that meet the condition.

The function returns the list of numbers that are divisible by all of their digits.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]
