I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Output>>>

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
	temp = [] 
	for x in string: 
		temp.append(x) 
	return temp 
def lst_to_string(List): 
	return ''.join(List) 
def get_char_count_array(string): 
	count = [0] * NO_OF_CHARS 
	for i in string: 
		count[ord(i)] += 1
	return count 
def remove_dirty_chars(string, second_string): 
	count = get_char_count_array(second_string) 
	ip_ind = 0
	res_ind = 0
	temp = '' 
	str_list = str_to_list(string) 
	while ip_ind != len(str_list): 
		temp = str_list[ip_ind] 
		if count[ord(temp)] == 0: 
			str_list[res_ind] = str_list[ip_ind] 
			res_ind += 1
		ip_ind+=1
	return lst_to_string(str_list[0:res_ind])

<<<Analysis>>>
The function `str_to_list` converts a string into a list of characters. The function `lst_to_string` converts a list of characters back into a string. The function `get_char_count_array` creates a count array of the characters in the second string. The function `remove_dirty_chars` removes the characters from the first string that are not present in the second string.

The function `remove_dirty_chars` takes two strings as input. It first creates a count array of the characters in the second string. Then it iterates over the characters in the first string. If a character is not present in the second string, it is added to the result string.

The function `remove_dirty_chars` returns a new string that contains only the characters present in the second string.

In the case of `remove_dirty_chars("probasscurve", "pros")`, the output would be "pros".
<<<Output>>>
"pros"
