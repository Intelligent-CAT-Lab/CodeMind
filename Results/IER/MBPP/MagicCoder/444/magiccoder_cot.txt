I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def trim_tuple(test_list, K):
  res = []
  for ele in test_list:
    N = len(ele)
    res.append(tuple(list(ele)[K: N - K]))
  return (str(res)) 
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`trim_tuple([(5, 3, 2, 1, 4), (3, 4, 9, 2, 1),(9, 1, 2, 3, 5), (4, 8, 2, 1, 7)], 2)`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function trim_tuple takes a list of tuples and an integer K as input.
The function iterates over each tuple in the list.
For each tuple, it calculates the length of the tuple and stores it in N.
It then creates a new tuple by slicing the original tuple from index K to N-K and appends it to the result list.
Finally, it returns the result list as a string.

For the given input, the function will return a string representation of a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list will be a slice of the original tuple from index 2 to the length of the tuple minus 2.

For example, for the tuple (5, 3, 2, 1, 4), the slice will be (3, 2, 1).

For the list [(5, 3, 2, 1, 4), (3, 4, 9, 2, 1),(9, 1, 2, 3, 5), (4, 8, 2, 1, 7)], the output will be ['(3, 2, 1)', '(4, 2)', '(2, 3)', '(2, 1)']
<<<Output>>>
['(3, 2, 1)', '(4, 2)', '(2, 3)', '(2, 1)']
