I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def flatten_list(list1):
    result_list = []
    if not list1: return result_list
    stack = [list(list1)]
    while stack:
        c_num = stack.pop()
        next = c_num.pop()
        if c_num: stack.append(c_num)
        if isinstance(next, list):
            if next: stack.append(list(next))
        else: result_list.append(next)
    result_list.reverse()
    return result_list

[Question]
What would be the return value of`flatten_list([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.

<<<Analysis>>>
The function flatten_list takes a list of lists as an argument. It initializes an empty list result_list and a stack with the input list.
The function then enters a loop that continues until the stack is empty.
In each iteration, it pops the last element from the stack and checks if it is a list. If it is, it pushes the list back onto the stack and pops the next element from the list. If the next element is not a list, it appends it to result_list.
After the loop finishes, it reverses result_list and returns it.

[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
