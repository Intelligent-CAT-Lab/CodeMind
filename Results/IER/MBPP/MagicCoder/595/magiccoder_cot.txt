I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(str1)) :  
        if str1[i] != str2[i] : 
            count += 1
    if count % 2 == 0 : 
        return (count // 2) 
    else : 
        return ("Not Possible") 
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`min_Swaps("1101","1110")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.

<<<Analysis>>>
The function min_Swaps takes two strings as input, str1 and str2. It compares each character of str1 and str2. If the characters are not equal, it increments the count.
The function then checks if the count is even. If it is, it returns the count divided by 2. If it is not, it returns "Not Possible".

In the given example, str1 = "1101" and str2 = "1110". The characters at the same positions in str1 and str2 are compared. The characters at positions 0 and 1 are equal, the characters at positions 2 and 3 are equal, and the characters at positions 4 and 5 are not equal. Therefore, the count is 2. Since 2 is even, the function returns 2 divided by 2, which is 1.
