I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Output>>>

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>

def find_literals(text, pattern):
  match = re.search(pattern, text)
  s = match.start()
  e = match.end()
  return (match.re.pattern, s, e)
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`find_literals('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.', 'fox')`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function find_literals takes two arguments: text and pattern. The text is a string where the pattern is to be searched. The pattern is a regular expression.

The function uses the re.search() method to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the text. The re.search() method returns a match object if the pattern is found in the text, else it returns None.

The match object has several methods that can be used to get the details of the match. Here, we are interested in the start() and end() methods, which return the starting and ending positions of the match in the text.

The function returns a tuple containing the pattern, the starting position and the ending position of the match.

In the given example, the text is 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.' and the pattern is 'fox'. The function will return ('fox', 16, 19), which means the pattern 'fox' starts at position 16 and ends at position 19 in the text.
<<<Output>>>
('fox', 16, 19)
