You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math 
def div_sum(n): 
  total = 1
  i = 2

  while i * i <= n:
    if (n % i == 0):
      total = (total + i + math.floor(n / i))
    i += 1

  return total

def are_equivalent(num1, num2): 
    return div_sum(num1) == div_sum(num2);

[Question]
What would be the return value of`are_equivalent(36, 57)`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function div_sum(n) calculates the sum of all divisors of n. It starts by initializing total to 1 and i to 2. It then enters a while loop that continues until i squared is greater than n.

Inside the loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i and n divided by i to total.

Finally, it increments i by 1 and repeats the process until i squared is greater than n.

The function are_equivalent(num1, num2) checks if the sum of divisors of num1 is equal to the sum of divisors of num2. If they are, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

In the case of are_equivalent(36, 57), the sum of divisors of 36 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 = 55, and the sum of divisors of 57 is 1 + 57 = 58. Therefore, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
