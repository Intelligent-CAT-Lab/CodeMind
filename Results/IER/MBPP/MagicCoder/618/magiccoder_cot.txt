I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

What would be the return value of`div_list([4,5,6],[1, 2, 3])`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function div_list takes two lists of numbers as input. It uses the map function to apply a lambda function to each pair of corresponding elements from the two lists. The lambda function divides the first number in the pair by the second number. The result is a new list of the quotients.

For the input lists [4,5,6] and [1, 2, 3], the lambda function is applied to the pairs (4, 1), (5, 2), and (6, 3). The result is [4.0, 2.5, 2.0], which is the output of the function.
<<<Output>>>
[4.0, 2.5, 2.0]
