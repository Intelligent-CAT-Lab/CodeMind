You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:

 cn = complex(x,y)
 cn=cmath.polar(cn)
 cn1 = cmath.rect(2, cmath.pi)
 return (cn,cn1)

[Question]
What would be the return value of`polar_rect(3,4)`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function polar_rect takes two arguments x and y, which are the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. The function first converts these two numbers into a complex number using the complex function. Then it calculates the polar form of this complex number using the polar function from the cmath module. The polar form of a complex number is a pair of numbers, the absolute value and the phase angle.

The function then calculates the rectangular form of a complex number using the rect function from the cmath module. The rectangular form of a complex number is a pair of numbers, the real part and the imaginary part.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the polar form and the rectangular form of the complex number.

The polar form of the complex number (3,4) is (5,0.9272952180016122) and the rectangular form is (2,1.5707963267948966).
<<<Output>>>
((5, 0.9272952180016122), (2, 1.5707963267948966))
