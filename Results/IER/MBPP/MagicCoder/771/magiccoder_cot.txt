I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from collections import deque
def check_expression(exp):
    if len(exp) & 1:
        return False
    stack = deque()
    for ch in exp:
        if ch == '(' or ch == '{' or ch == '[':
            stack.append(ch)
        if ch == ')' or ch == '}' or ch == ']':
            if not stack:
                return False
            top = stack.pop()
            if (top == '(' and ch != ')') or (top == '{' and ch != '}' or (top == '[' and ch != ']')):
                return False
    return not stack

<<<Analysis>>>
The function check_expression takes a string expression as input. The expression is checked for balanced parentheses.
The expression is iterated over character by character. If the character is an opening bracket, it is pushed onto the stack. If the character is a closing bracket, it is compared with the top of the stack. If they match, the top of the stack is popped. If they do not match, the function returns False.
If the stack is not empty at the end of the iteration, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
