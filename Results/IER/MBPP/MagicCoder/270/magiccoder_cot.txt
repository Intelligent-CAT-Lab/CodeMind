You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_even_and_even_index(arr):  
    i = 0
    sum = 0
    for i in range(0, len(arr),2): 
        if (arr[i] % 2 == 0) : 
            sum += arr[i]  
    return sum

What would be the return value of`sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8])`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function sum_even_and_even_index takes an array as input.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used as an index to access elements in the array.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of even numbers at even indices.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the array, incrementing by 2 each time. This means it will consider elements at even indices.
For each element at even index i in this range, it checks if the element is even. If it is, it adds the element to sum. The condition is met when the element is 12, 18 and 8.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 26.
<<<Output>>>
26
