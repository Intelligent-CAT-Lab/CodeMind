I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def dog_age(h_age):
 if h_age < 0:
 	exit()
 elif h_age <= 2:
	 d_age = h_age * 10.5
 else:
	 d_age = 21 + (h_age - 2)*4
 return d_age

What would be the return value of`dog_age(12)`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h_age is initialized to 12.
The code checks if h_age is less than 0. Since 12 is not less than 0, the code proceeds to the next condition.
The code checks if h_age is less than or equal to 2. Since 12 is greater than 2, the code proceeds to the else condition.
The code calculates the dog's age in human years by using the formula: if the human's age is 2 or less, the dog's age is 10.5 times the human's age. If the human's age is more than 2, the dog's age is 21 (the age of a 2-year-old dog) plus 4 times the difference between the human's age and 2.
The calculation gives 21 + 4*(12-2) = 21 + 24 = 45.
<<<Output>>>
45
