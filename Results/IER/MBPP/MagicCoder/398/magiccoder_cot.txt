You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

What would be the return value of`sum_of_digits([10,2,56])`?

The function sum_of_digits takes a list of numbers as input. It then converts each number to a string, and for each digit in the string, it checks if it is a digit using the isdigit() method. If it is, it converts the digit back to an integer and adds it to the sum.

For the input [10,2,56], the function will convert each number to a string, which will be '10', '2', and '56'. For each digit in these strings, it checks if it is a digit. The digits in '10' are '1' and '0', which are digits, so they are converted back to integers and added to the sum. The digits in '2' are '2', which is a digit, so it is converted back to an integer and added to the sum. The digits in '56' are '5' and '6', which are digits, so they are converted back to integers and added to the sum.

The final sum is 1 + 0 + 2 + 5 + 6 = 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
