I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_median(arr1, arr2, n):
  i = 0
  j = 0
  m1 = -1
  m2 = -1
  count = 0
  while count < n + 1:
    count += 1
    if i == n:
      m1 = m2
      m2 = arr2[0]
      break
    elif j == n:
      m1 = m2
      m2 = arr1[0]
      break
    if arr1[i] <= arr2[j]:
      m1 = m2
      m2 = arr1[i]
      i += 1
    else:
      m1 = m2
      m2 = arr2[j]
      j += 1
  return (m1 + m2)/2

<<<Analysis>>>
The function get_median takes two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 and their size n as input. It initializes two variables m1 and m2 to -1. It then enters a while loop that continues until count is less than n+1.
Inside the loop, it checks if either of the arrays has been fully traversed. If so, it assigns the last element of the other array to m1 and the current element of the other array to m2.
If neither array has been fully traversed, it compares the current elements of both arrays. If the current element of arr1 is less than or equal to the current element of arr2, it assigns the current element of arr1 to m1 and the current element of arr2 to m2.
If the current element of arr1 is greater than the current element of arr2, it assigns the current element of arr2 to m1 and the current element of arr1 to m2.
After the loop finishes, it returns the average of m1 and m2 as the median.
