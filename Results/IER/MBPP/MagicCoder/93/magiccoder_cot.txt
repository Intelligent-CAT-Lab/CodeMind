I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def power(a,b):
	if b==0:
		return 1
	elif a==0:
		return 0
	elif b==1:
		return a
	else:
		return a*power(a,b-1)

[Question]
What would be the return value of`power(3,4)`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function power(a,b) is defined to calculate the power of a number. The base number a is raised to the power b.
The function checks if b is 0, if it is, it returns 1. This is because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.
The function checks if a is 0, if it is, it returns 0. This is because the power of any number to 0 is 1.
The function checks if b is 1, if it is, it returns a. This is because any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself.
If none of the above conditions are met, the function calls itself with the arguments a and b-1, and multiplies the result with a. This is a recursive function.
<<<Output>>>
The output of power(3,4) is 81.
