I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
def next_smallest_palindrome(num):
    numstr = str(num)
    for i in range(num+1,sys.maxsize):
        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:
            return i

What would be the return value of`next_smallest_palindrome(99)`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function next_smallest_palindrome takes an integer num as input. It converts the integer to a string and checks if it is a palindrome. If it is not, it increments the number by 1 and checks again. This process continues until it finds a palindrome.

The input to the function is 99. The first step is to convert 99 to a string, which gives "99". Since "99" is not a palindrome, the function increments the number by 1, which gives 100. The function then converts 100 to a string, which gives "100". Since "100" is not a palindrome, the function increments the number by 1, which gives 101. The function then converts 101 to a string, which gives "101". Since "101" is a palindrome, the function returns 101.
<<<Output>>>
101
