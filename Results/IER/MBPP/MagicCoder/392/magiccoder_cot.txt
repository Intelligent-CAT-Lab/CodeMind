You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_max_sum (n):
	res = list()
	res.append(0)
	res.append(1)
	i = 2
	while i<n + 1:
		res.append(max(i, (res[int(i / 2)] 
						+ res[int(i / 3)] +
							res[int(i / 4)]
						+ res[int(i / 5)])))
		i = i + 1
	return res[n]

What would be the return value of`get_max_sum(60)`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function get_max_sum(n) takes an integer n as input. It first initializes a list res with 0 and 1. Then it enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive). For each number i in this range, it calculates the maximum of i and the sum of the values in res at the indices i/2, i/3, i/4, and i/5. The result is appended to the end of res. After the loop finishes, the function returns the value at index n in res.

The function get_max_sum(60) will return the maximum sum that can be obtained by breaking down the number 60 into its prime factors and adding up the results.
<<<Output>>>
150
