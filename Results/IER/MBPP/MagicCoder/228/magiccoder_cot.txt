You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(n,l,r):  
    num = (((1 << r) - 1) ^ ((1 << (l - 1)) - 1)) 
    new_num = n & num
    if (new_num == 0): 
        return True
    return False

<<<Analysis>>>
The function `all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range` takes three arguments: n, l, and r.

The variable `num` is calculated by first shifting 1 to the left by r bits (which gives a number with r least significant bits set to 1), then subtracting 1 from this number. This gives a number with all bits set from the rth bit to the least significant bit.

Then, the number is shifted to the left by (l-1) bits and subtracted by 1 to get a number with all bits set from the (l-1)th bit to the least significant bit.

The bitwise XOR operation is performed on these two numbers to get a number with all bits set from the rth bit to the (l-1)th bit.

The bitwise AND operation is performed on the number n and this number to get a new number.

If the new number is 0, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.

For the given input n=4, l=1, r=2, the number is 4 (in binary 100). The number with all bits set from the 1st bit to the 2nd bit is 3 (in binary 11). The bitwise AND operation of 4 and 3 gives 0. Hence, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
