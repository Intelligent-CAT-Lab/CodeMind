I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

Consider the following code:

def max_sum(arr): 
	MSIBS = arr[:] 
	for i in range(len(arr)): 
		for j in range(0, i): 
			if arr[i] > arr[j] and MSIBS[i] < MSIBS[j] + arr[i]: 
				MSIBS[i] = MSIBS[j] + arr[i] 
	MSDBS = arr[:] 
	for i in range(1, len(arr) + 1): 
		for j in range(1, i): 
			if arr[-i] > arr[-j] and MSDBS[-i] < MSDBS[-j] + arr[-i]: 
				MSDBS[-i] = MSDBS[-j] + arr[-i] 
	max_sum = float("-Inf") 
	for i, j, k in zip(MSIBS, MSDBS, arr): 
		max_sum = max(max_sum, i + j - k) 
	return max_sum

What would be the return value of`max_sum([1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9])`?

The function max_sum takes an array arr as input.
The function first creates two lists MSIBS and MSDBS which are copies of arr.
MSIBS is used to store the maximum sum increasing subsequence ending at each index i.
MSDBS is used to store the maximum sum decreasing subsequence starting at each index i.
The function then iterates over the array arr and for each element arr[i], it checks if arr[i] is greater than arr[j] and if MSIBS[i] is less than MSIBS[j] + arr[i]. If the condition is met, MSIBS[i] is updated to MSIBS[j] + arr[i].
The function then does the same for the reversed array arr.
Finally, the function calculates the maximum sum that can be obtained by selecting a number from the increasing subsequence and a number from the decreasing subsequence and subtracting the selected number from the array.
