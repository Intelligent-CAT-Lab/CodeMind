You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def cal_sum(n): 
	a = 3
	b = 0
	c = 2
	if (n == 0): 
		return 3
	if (n == 1): 
		return 3
	if (n == 2): 
		return 5
	sum = 5
	while (n > 2): 
		d = a + b 
		sum = sum + d 
		a = b 
		b = c 
		c = d 
		n = n-1
	return sum

What would be the return value of`cal_sum(9)`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function cal_sum(n) takes an integer n as input. It first initializes three variables a, b, and c to 3, 0, and 2 respectively. If n is 0, it returns 3. If n is 1, it returns 3. If n is 2, it returns 5.

Then it initializes the variable sum to 5. It enters a while loop that continues until n is greater than 2. In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the sum of a and b (d), adds d to sum, and then updates a, b, c, and n.

After the loop finishes, it returns the final value of sum.

For cal_sum(9), the loop will run 7 times, adding the sum of a and b (which is 5) to sum 7 times. The final value of sum will be 5+5+5+5+5+5+5 = 40.
<<<Output>>>
40
