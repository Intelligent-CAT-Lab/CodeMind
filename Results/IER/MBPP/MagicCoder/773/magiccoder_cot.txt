@@ Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import re
def occurance_substring(text,pattern):
 for match in re.finditer(pattern, text):
    s = match.start()
    e = match.end()
    return (text[s:e], s, e)
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`occurance_substring('python programming, python language','python')`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function `occurance_substring` takes two arguments: `text` and `pattern`. The `text` is a string where the `pattern` is to be searched. The `pattern` is a string that is used as a regular expression.

The function uses the `re.finditer` method to find all occurrences of the `pattern` in the `text`. This method returns an iterator yielding match objects for each match.

For each match, it returns a tuple containing the matched substring, the start index of the match and the end index of the match.

In the given example, the `text` is 'python programming, python language' and the `pattern` is 'python'. The function will return the first occurrence of 'python' in the text, which is 'python', the start index of 'python' is 0 and the end index of 'python' is 5.

<<<Output>>>
('python', 0, 5)
