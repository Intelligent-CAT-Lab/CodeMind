I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_odd(n): 
    terms = (n + 1)//2
    sum1 = terms * terms 
    return sum1  
def sum_in_range(l,r): 
    return sum_odd(r) - sum_odd(l - 1)

<<<Analysis>>>
The function sum_odd(n) calculates the sum of the first n odd numbers. It does this by finding the number of terms (n + 1)//2, then squaring this to get the sum.

The function sum_in_range(l,r) calculates the sum of all odd numbers between l and r inclusive. It does this by subtracting the sum of the odd numbers less than l from the sum of the odd numbers less than or equal to r.

For the input sum_in_range(2,5), the function sum_odd(5) is called, which calculates the sum of the first 5 odd numbers (9). The function sum_odd(2) is called, which calculates the sum of the first 2 odd numbers (1). The difference between these two sums is 9 - 1 = 8, which is the output of the function.
<<<Output>>>
8
