I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    C = [0] * (k + 1); 
    C[0] = 1; # nC0 is 1 
    for i in range(1,n + 1):  
        for j in range(min(i, k),0,-1): 
            C[j] = C[j] + C[j - 1]; 
    return C[k]; 
def sum_Of_product(n): 
    return binomial_Coeff(2 * n,n - 1);

The function sum_Of_product(n) calculates the sum of products of n pairs of numbers. It uses the binomial coefficient function to calculate the number of ways to choose n pairs from 2n numbers.

The binomial coefficient function calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, k) using dynamic programming. It initializes an array C of size k + 1 with all elements set to 0. Then it iterates over the range of n from 1 to n + 1 and for each i, it iterates over the range of min(i, k) from k to 1. For each j, it updates the value of C[j] by adding the value of C[j - 1].

Finally, it returns the value of C[k] which is the binomial coefficient C(2n, n - 1).

The function sum_Of_product(n) calculates the sum of products of n pairs of numbers by calling the binomial coefficient function with arguments 2n and n - 1.

For n = 3, the function sum_Of_product(3) calculates the sum of products of 3 pairs of numbers. It uses the binomial coefficient function to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 pairs from 6 numbers.

The binomial coefficient C(6, 2) is calculated as follows:

C(6, 2) = C(6, 2) + C(5, 1)
        = C(6, 2) + C(5, 2)
        = C(6, 2) + C(5, 2) + C(4, 1)
        = C(6, 2) + C(5, 2) + C(4, 2)
        = C(6, 2) + C(5, 2) + C(4, 2) + C(3, 1)
        = C(6, 2) + C(5, 2) + C(4, 2) + C(3, 2)
        = C(6, 2) + C(5, 2) + C(4, 2) + C(3, 2) + C(2, 1)
        = C(6, 2) + C(5, 2) + C(4, 2) + C(3, 2) + C(2, 2)
        = C(6, 2) + C(5, 2) + C(4, 2) + C(3, 2) + C(2, 2) + C(1, 1)
        = C(6, 2) + C(5, 2) + C(4, 2) + C(3, 2) + C(2, 2) + C(1, 2)
        = C(6, 2) + C(5, 2) + C(4, 2) + C(3, 2) + C(2, 2) + C(1, 2) + C(0, 1)
        = C(6, 2) + C(5, 2) + C(4, 2) + C(3, 2) + C(2, 2) + C(1, 2) + C(0, 2)

The sum of products of 3 pairs of numbers is the sum of these binomial coefficients.
