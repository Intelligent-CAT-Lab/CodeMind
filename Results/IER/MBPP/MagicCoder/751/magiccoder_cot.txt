I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:

def check_min_heap_helper(arr, i):
    if 2 * i + 2 > len(arr):
        return True
    left_child = (arr[i] <= arr[2 * i + 1]) and check_min_heap_helper(arr, 2 * i + 1)
    right_child = (2 * i + 2 == len(arr)) or (arr[i] <= arr[2 * i + 2] 
                                      and check_min_heap_helper(arr, 2 * i + 2))
    return left_child and right_child

def check_min_heap(arr):
  return check_min_heap_helper(arr, 0)

What would be the return value of`check_min_heap([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])`?

The function check_min_heap_helper is a recursive function that checks if the subtree rooted at index i in the array arr is a min heap. The function takes an array arr and an index i as input.

The function first checks if the left child of the node at index i exists. If it doesn't, it means the node is a leaf node and it returns True.

Then it checks if the node at index i is less than or equal to its left child and recursively checks the left subtree.

Next, it checks if the right child of the node at index i exists. If it doesn't, it means the node has only one child and it returns True.

Then it checks if the node at index i is less than or equal to its right child and recursively checks the right subtree.

Finally, it returns the logical AND of the results of the left and right checks.

The function check_min_heap simply calls check_min_heap_helper with the root of the heap (index 0) and returns the result.

For the input array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the function will return True because the array represents a min heap.
