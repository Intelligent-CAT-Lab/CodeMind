I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_product(arr):   
  n = len(arr)
  mpis = arr[:]
  for i in range(n): 
    current_prod = arr[i]
    j = i + 1
    while j < n:
      if arr[j-1] > arr[j]: 
        break
      current_prod *= arr[j]
      if current_prod > mpis[j]:
        mpis[j] = current_prod 
      j = j + 1
  return max(mpis)

<<<Analysis>>>
The function max_product takes an array of integers as input. The array is named arr.
The variable n is initialized to the length of the array arr.
The variable mpis is initialized to a copy of the array arr.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each index i in this range, it calculates the product of the elements from index i to n-1 and stores it in current_prod.
The code checks if the previous element is greater than the current element. If it is, it breaks the loop.
If the product of the elements from index i to n-1 is greater than the element at index j in mpis, it updates the element at index j in mpis to the product of the elements from index i to n-1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the maximum value in mpis.
