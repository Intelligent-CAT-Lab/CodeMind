You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Output>>>

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from array import array
def positive_count(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    n1 = 0
    for x in nums:
        if x > 0:
            n1 += 1
        else:
          None
    return round(n1/n,2)
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`positive_count([0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8])`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable nums is initialized to [0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8].
variable n is initialized to the length of nums, which is 13.
variable n1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of positive numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each number in nums.
For each number x in nums, it checks if x is greater than 0. If it is, it increments n1 by 1. If not, it does nothing.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the percentage of positive numbers in nums by dividing n1 by n and rounding to 2 decimal places.
The final value of n1/n is 9/13, which is approximately 0.62.
<<<Output>>>
0.62
