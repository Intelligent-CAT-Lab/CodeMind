@@ Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:

def check_distinct(test_tup):
  res = True
  temp = set()
  for ele in test_tup:
    if ele in temp:
      res = False
      break
    temp.add(ele)
  return res

@@ Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function check_distinct takes a tuple as an argument. The tuple is iterated over, and for each element, it checks if it is already in the set temp. If it is, the function returns False and breaks the loop. If the element is not in temp, it is added to temp. If the loop finishes without finding any duplicate elements, the function returns True.

In the given tuple (1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4), the first element 1 is added to the set temp. Then the next element 4 is added to temp. However, the next element 1 is already in temp, so the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
