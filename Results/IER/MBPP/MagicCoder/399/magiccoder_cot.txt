I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:

def bitwise_xor(test_tup1, test_tup2):

  return (res)

What would be the return value of`bitwise_xor((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function bitwise_xor takes two tuples as input. The tuples are of the same length.
The function uses the zip function to iterate over the two tuples simultaneously.
For each pair of elements (ele1, ele2) in the tuples, it calculates the bitwise XOR of ele1 and ele2 and stores the result in a new tuple.
The function then returns the new tuple.

The input tuples are (10, 4, 6, 9) and (5, 2, 3, 3).
The bitwise XOR of 10 and 5 is 15, the bitwise XOR of 4 and 2 is 6, the bitwise XOR of 6 and 3 is 5, and the bitwise XOR of 9 and 3 is 12.
So, the output of the function is (15, 6, 5, 12).
<<<Output>>>
(15, 6, 5, 12)
