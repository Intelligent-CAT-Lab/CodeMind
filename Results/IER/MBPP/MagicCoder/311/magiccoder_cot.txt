I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n): 
    if not (n & (n + 1)): 
        return n 
    pos, temp, count = 0, n, 0 
    while temp: 
        if not (temp & 1): 
            pos = count      
        count += 1; temp>>=1
    return (n | (1 << (pos)))

What would be the return value of`set_left_most_unset_bit(10)`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function set_left_most_unset_bit(n) takes an integer n as input.
The function checks if the binary representation of n and n+1 have no common set bits. If they do, it returns n.
If not, it finds the position of the leftmost unset bit in the binary representation of n.
It then sets the bit at this position to 1 and returns the result.

For n = 10, the binary representation is 1010. The leftmost unset bit is at position 2. After setting the bit at position 2, the new binary representation is 1110, which is 14 in decimal.
<<<Output>>>
14
