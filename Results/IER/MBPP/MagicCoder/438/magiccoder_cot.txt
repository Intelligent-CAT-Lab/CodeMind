You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def count_bidirectional(test_list):
  res = 0
  for idx in range(0, len(test_list)):
    for iidx in range(idx + 1, len(test_list)):
      if test_list[iidx][0] == test_list[idx][1] and test_list[idx][1] == test_list[iidx][0]:
        res += 1
  return res
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`count_bidirectional([(5, 6), (1, 2), (6, 5), (9, 1), (6, 5), (2, 1)] )`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function count_bidirectional takes a list of tuples as an argument. Each tuple contains two integers. The function counts the number of pairs of tuples where the second element of the first tuple is equal to the first element of the second tuple and vice versa.

The function iterates over the list of tuples using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over the indices of the list, and the inner loop iterates over the remaining indices of the list.

For each pair of indices, it checks if the second element of the first tuple is equal to the first element of the second tuple and vice versa. If the condition is met, it increments the result counter.

The function returns the final count of such pairs.

In the given list [(5, 6), (1, 2), (6, 5), (9, 1), (6, 5), (2, 1)], the pairs are (5, 6) and (6, 5), so the function returns 2.
