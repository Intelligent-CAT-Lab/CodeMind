The function catalan_number(num) is defined to calculate the Catalan numbers. The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursive structures.

The base case of the recursion is when num is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns 1.

The function then initializes res_num to 0, which will be used to accumulate the result.

The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to num. For each i in this range, it calculates the Catalan number of i and the Catalan number of num-i-1, multiplies them together, and adds the result to res_num.

After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of res_num.

The Catalan number of a positive integer n is the number of ways that a convex polygon of n+2 sides can be cut into triangles by diagonals.

The Catalan numbers are given by the formula:
C(n) = (2n choose n) - (2n choose n+1)

The Catalan numbers are used in many counting problems, such as the number of ways to parenthesize an expression, the number of ways to divide a polygon into triangles, and the number of ways to triangulate a polygon.

The Catalan numbers are also used in the theory of binary trees, and in the theory of lattice paths.
