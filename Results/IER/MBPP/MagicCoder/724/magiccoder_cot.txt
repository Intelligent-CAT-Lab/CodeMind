You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def power_base_sum(base, power):
    return sum([int(i) for i in str(pow(base, power))])

[Question]
What would be the return value of`power_base_sum(2,100)`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function power_base_sum takes two arguments: base and power. It calculates the power of the base and converts the result to a string. Then it iterates over each digit in the string, converts it back to an integer and adds it to the sum.

For example, if the function is called with power_base_sum(2,100), the function will calculate 2^100, which is 1.2676506002282294e+30. This number is then converted to a string and each digit is converted back to an integer and added to the sum.

The sum of the digits of 1.2676506002282294e+30 is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
