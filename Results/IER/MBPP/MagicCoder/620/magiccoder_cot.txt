You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def largest_subset(a):
	n = len(a)
	dp = [0 for i in range(n)]
	dp[n - 1] = 1; 
	for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
		mxm = 0;
		for j in range(i + 1, n):
			if a[j] % a[i] == 0 or a[i] % a[j] == 0:
				mxm = max(mxm, dp[j])
		dp[i] = 1 + mxm
	return max(dp)
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`largest_subset([ 1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18 ])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The function largest_subset takes a list of integers as input. The list is stored in the variable 'a'.
The length of the list is stored in the variable 'n'.
A list 'dp' of size 'n' is initialized with all elements as 0.
The last element of the list 'dp' is set to 1.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from the second last element to the first element of the list.
For each element 'i' in this range, it calculates the maximum value of 'dp' for all elements 'j' that are greater than 'i' and stores it in'mxm'.
The value of 'dp[i]' is set to 1 plus'mxm'.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the maximum value in the list 'dp'.
