Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_sum(arr): 
	MSIBS = arr[:] 
	for i in range(len(arr)): 
		for j in range(0, i): 
			if arr[i] > arr[j] and MSIBS[i] < MSIBS[j] + arr[i]: 
				MSIBS[i] = MSIBS[j] + arr[i] 
	MSDBS = arr[:] 
	for i in range(1, len(arr) + 1): 
		for j in range(1, i): 
			if arr[-i] > arr[-j] and MSDBS[-i] < MSDBS[-j] + arr[-i]: 
				MSDBS[-i] = MSDBS[-j] + arr[-i] 
	max_sum = float("-Inf") 
	for i, j, k in zip(MSIBS, MSDBS, arr): 
		max_sum = max(max_sum, i + j - k) 
	return max_sum
<Code>

What would be the return value of `max_sum([1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9].
The code creates two new arrays MSIBS and MSDBS, which are copies of arr.
MSIBS is used to store the maximum sum including the current element.
MSDBS is used to store the maximum sum including the current element, but starting from the end of the array.
The code then enters two nested loops, one for MSIBS and one for MSDBS.
For each element in the array, the code checks if it is greater than the previous element and if the maximum sum including the current element is less than the sum of the maximum sum including the previous element and the current element. If it is, it updates the maximum sum for that element.
After the loops finish, the code enters a third loop that iterates over the three arrays (MSIBS, MSDBS, and arr) and calculates the maximum sum for each possible combination of three elements. It returns the maximum of these values.
<<<Output>>>
127
