Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def comb_sort(nums):
    shrink_fact = 1.3
    gaps = len(nums)
    swapped = True
    i = 0
    while gaps > 1 or swapped:
        gaps = int(float(gaps) / shrink_fact)
        swapped = False
        i = 0
        while gaps + i < len(nums):
            if nums[i] > nums[i+gaps]:
                nums[i], nums[i+gaps] = nums[i+gaps], nums[i]
                swapped = True
            i += 1
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `comb_sort([5, 15, 37, 25, 79])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable nums is initialized to [5, 15, 37, 25, 79].
The variable shrink_fact is initialized to 1.3, which is used to determine the shrink factor for the gap sequence.
The variable gaps is initialized to the length of nums, which is 5.
The variable swapped is initialized to True, which is used to determine if any swaps were made in the previous iteration.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which is used to iterate through the list.
The code enters a while loop that continues until gaps is less than or equal to 1 or swapped is False.
Inside the while loop, the code calculates the new value of gaps based on the shrink factor and the current value of gaps.
The code then enters another while loop that continues until gaps + i is greater than or equal to the length of nums.
Inside the while loop, the code compares the values at index i and i+gaps and swaps them if necessary.
The code then increments i by 1.
After the while loops finish, the code returns the sorted list nums.
<<<Output>>>
[5, 15, 25, 37, 79]
