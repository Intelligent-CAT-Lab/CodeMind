Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def check_min_heap_helper(arr, i):
    if 2 * i + 2 > len(arr):
        return True
    left_child = (arr[i] <= arr[2 * i + 1]) and check_min_heap_helper(arr, 2 * i + 1)
    right_child = (2 * i + 2 == len(arr)) or (arr[i] <= arr[2 * i + 2] 
                                      and check_min_heap_helper(arr, 2 * i + 2))
    return left_child and right_child

def check_min_heap(arr):
  return check_min_heap_helper(arr, 0)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `check_min_heap([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
The function check_min_heap_helper is called with arr and 0 as arguments.
The function checks if 2 * i + 2 is greater than the length of arr. If it is, it returns True, indicating that the current node is a leaf node.
If the current node is not a leaf node, the function checks if the left child is smaller than or equal to the parent and if the left child satisfies the heap property.
The function then checks if the right child is smaller than or equal to the parent and if the right child satisfies the heap property.
If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns True.
The function is then called again with arr and 0 as arguments, and the process continues recursively until all nodes are checked.
The final return value is True, indicating that the input array is a valid min heap.
<<<Output>>>
True
