Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def count_vowels(test_str):
  res = 0
  vow_list = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
  for idx in range(1, len(test_str) - 1):
    if test_str[idx] not in vow_list and (test_str[idx - 1] in vow_list or test_str[idx + 1] in vow_list):
      res += 1
  if test_str[0] not in vow_list and test_str[1] in vow_list:
    res += 1
  if test_str[-1] not in vow_list and test_str[-2] in vow_list:
    res += 1
  return (res) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `count_vowels('bestinstareels')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_str is initialized to 'bestinstareels'.
variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of vowels.
variable vow_list is initialized to a list of vowels.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to len(test_str) - 2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the characters except the first and last ones.
For each character at index idx, it checks if it is not a vowel and if the previous or next character is a vowel. If both conditions are met, it increments the count of vowels.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the first and last characters are not vowels and if the second and second-to-last characters are vowels. If both conditions are met, it increments the count of vowels.
Finally, the code returns the final value of res, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
