Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def rev(num):    
    rev_num = 0
    while (num > 0):  
        rev_num = (rev_num * 10 + num % 10) 
        num = num // 10  
    return rev_num  
def check(n):    
    return (2 * rev(n) == n + 1)  
<Code>

What would be the return value of `check(70)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 70.
The function rev(n) is called with n as input.
The function rev(n) calculates the reverse of n by using a while loop.
The variable rev_num is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the reverse of n.
The while loop continues until num becomes 0.
Inside the while loop, the code multiplies rev_num by 10 and adds the last digit of num (num % 10).
The code then updates num to be num // 10, which removes the last digit of num.
After the while loop finishes, the code returns the final value of rev_num, which is the reverse of n.
The function check(n) is called with n as input.
The function check(n) calculates the sum of the digits of n and n+1, and checks if the result is equal to 2 times the reverse of n.
If the condition is met, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
The code then calls the check(70) function and prints the return value, which is True.
<<<Output>>>
True
