Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def cal_sum(n): 
	a = 3
	b = 0
	c = 2
	if (n == 0): 
		return 3
	if (n == 1): 
		return 3
	if (n == 2): 
		return 5
	sum = 5
	while (n > 2): 
		d = a + b 
		sum = sum + d 
		a = b 
		b = c 
		c = d 
		n = n-1
	return sum
<Code>

What would be the return value of `cal_sum(9)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 9.
The code checks if n is equal to 0, 1 or 2. If it is, it returns the corresponding value.
If n is greater than 2, the code initializes variables a, b, c and sum to 3, 0, 2 and 5, respectively.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while n is greater than 2.
Inside the loop, the code calculates the value of d as the sum of a and b, and adds it to sum. It then updates the values of a, b and c to the next values in the sequence.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum, which is 127.
<<<Output>>>
127
