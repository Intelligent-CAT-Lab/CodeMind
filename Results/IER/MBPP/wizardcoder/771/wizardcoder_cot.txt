Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from collections import deque
def check_expression(exp):
    if len(exp) & 1:
        return False
    stack = deque()
    for ch in exp:
        if ch == '(' or ch == '{' or ch == '[':
            stack.append(ch)
        if ch == ')' or ch == '}' or ch == ']':
            if not stack:
                return False
            top = stack.pop()
            if (top == '(' and ch!= ')') or (top == '{' and ch!= '}' or (top == '[' and ch!= ']')):
                return False
    return not stack
<Code>

What would be the return value of `check_expression("{()}[{}]")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable exp is initialized to "{()}[{}]", which is a string representing a valid expression.
The function check_expression() takes an expression as input and returns True if the expression is valid and False otherwise.
The function first checks if the length of the expression is odd. If it is, the function returns False because an expression with an odd length cannot be balanced.
The function then initializes an empty stack.
The function then iterates through each character in the expression. If the character is an opening parenthesis, bracket, or brace, it is pushed onto the stack. If the character is a closing parenthesis, bracket, or brace, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, the function returns False because the expression is not balanced. Otherwise, the function pops the top element from the stack and checks if it matches the closing parenthesis, bracket, or brace. If it does not match, the function returns False because the expression is not balanced.
If the function has iterated through the entire expression without returning False, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, the function returns True because the expression is balanced. Otherwise, the function returns False because the expression is not balanced.
<<<Output>>>
True
