Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_first_occurrence(A, x):
    (left, right) = (0, len(A) - 1)
    result = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if x == A[mid]:
            result = mid
            right = mid - 1
        elif x < A[mid]:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `find_first_occurrence([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A is initialized to [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], and variable x is initialized to 5.
The code initializes two variables, left and right, to 0 and len(A)-1, respectively. These variables will be used to keep track of the left and right indices of the subarray being searched.
The variable result is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the index of the first occurrence of x in A.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right.
The code calculates the midpoint of the subarray using integer division, and checks if x is equal to A[mid]. If it is, the code sets result to mid, and updates right to mid-1. This is because we know that the first occurrence of x to the left of mid is the one we are looking for.
If x is less than A[mid], the code updates right to mid-1, because we know that the first occurrence of x to the left of mid is to the right of the current midpoint.
If x is greater than A[mid], the code updates left to mid+1, because we know that the first occurrence of x to the left of mid is to the left of the current midpoint.
After the while loop finishes, the code returns the final value of result, which is 1, because the first occurrence of 5 in A is at index 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
