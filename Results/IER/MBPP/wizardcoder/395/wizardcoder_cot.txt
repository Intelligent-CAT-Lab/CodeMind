Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def first_non_repeating_character(str1):
  char_order = []
  ctr = {}
  for c in str1:
    if c in ctr:
      ctr[c] += 1
    else:
      ctr[c] = 1 
      char_order.append(c)
  for c in char_order:
    if ctr[c] == 1:
      return c
  return None
<Code>

What would be the return value of `first_non_repeating_character("abcabc")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable str1 is initialized to "abcabc".
The code initializes an empty list char_order and an empty dictionary ctr.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c in str1.
If c is already in the dictionary ctr, it increments the count of c by 1.
Otherwise, it adds c to the dictionary ctr with a count of 1 and appends c to the list char_order.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates over each character c in char_order.
If the count of c in the dictionary ctr is 1, it returns c as the first non-repeating character.
If the loop finishes without finding a non-repeating character, it returns None.
<<<Output>>>
None
