Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_length(string): 
	n = len(string)
	current_sum = 0
	max_sum = 0
	for i in range(n): 
		current_sum += (1 if string[i] == '0' else -1) 
		if current_sum < 0: 
			current_sum = 0
		max_sum = max(current_sum, max_sum) 
	return max_sum if max_sum else 0
<Code>

What would be the return value of `find_length("11000010001")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable string is initialized to "11000010001".
variable n is initialized to the length of the string, which is 16.
variable current_sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of consecutive zeros.
variable max_sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum sum of consecutive zeros seen so far.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider each character in the string.
For each character, it checks if it is a zero or not. If it is, it increments current_sum by 1. If it is not, it decrements current_sum by 1. If current_sum becomes negative, it is reset to 0.
The maximum of current_sum and max_sum is stored in max_sum.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of max_sum, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
