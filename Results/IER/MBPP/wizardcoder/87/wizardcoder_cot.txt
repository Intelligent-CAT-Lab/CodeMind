Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import collections as ct
def merge_dictionaries_three(dict1,dict2, dict3):
    merged_dict = dict(ct.ChainMap({},dict1,dict2,dict3))
    return merged_dict
<Code>

What would be the return value of `merge_dictionaries_three({ "R": "Red", "B": "Black", "P": "Pink" }, { "G": "Green", "W": "White" },{ "O": "Orange", "W": "White", "B": "Black" })`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function merge_dictionaries_three takes three dictionaries as input.
The first dictionary dict1 has three key-value pairs: "R": "Red", "B": "Black", "P": "Pink".
The second dictionary dict2 has two key-value pairs: "G": "Green", "W": "White".
The third dictionary dict3 has three key-value pairs: "O": "Orange", "W": "White", "B": "Black".
The function uses the ChainMap function from the collections module to merge the dictionaries.
The merged dictionary is stored in the variable merged_dict.
The function returns the merged dictionary.
<<<Output>>>The return value of the code is:
{
    "R": "Red",
    "B": "Black",
    "P": "Pink",
    "G": "Green",
    "W": "White",
    "O": "Orange"
}

The merged dictionary contains all the key-value pairs from the three input dictionaries, with the exception of the key-value pair "W": "White" from the second and third dictionaries, which is overwritten by the value from the third dictionary.
