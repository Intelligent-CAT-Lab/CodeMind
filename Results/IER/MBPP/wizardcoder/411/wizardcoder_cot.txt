Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import re
def snake_to_camel(word):
  return ''.join(x.capitalize() or '_' for x in word.split('_'))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `snake_to_camel('android_tv')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable word is initialized to 'android_tv'.
The code imports the re module, which provides support for regular expressions.
The code defines a function called snake_to_camel that takes a string argument word.
The function splits the string word using the '_' character as the delimiter and stores the resulting substrings in a list called words.
The function then iterates over the list of words and applies the capitalize() method to each word, except for the first word, which is left unchanged.
Finally, the function joins the resulting list of words into a single string using the empty string as the separator and returns the resulting string.

The input 'android_tv' is split into the list ['android', 'tv'].
The first word 'android' is left unchanged.
The second word 'tv' is capitalized to 'Tv'.
The resulting list of words is ['android', 'Tv'].
The function joins the list of words into a single string 'androidTv' and returns this string.

The return value of the code is 'androidTv'.
<<<Output>>>
androidTv
