Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def frequency_lists(list1):
    list1 = [item for sublist in list1 for item in sublist]
    dic_data = {}
    for num in list1:
        if num in dic_data.keys():
            dic_data[num] += 1
        else:
            key = num
            value = 1
            dic_data[key] = value
    return dic_data

<Code>

What would be the return value of `frequency_lists([[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable list1 is initialized to [[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]].
The code creates a new list by flattening the input list using a list comprehension.
The code then creates an empty dictionary called dic_data.
The code then iterates over each number in the flattened list1.
If the number is already a key in the dictionary, the code increments the corresponding value by 1.
If the number is not a key in the dictionary, the code adds the number as a key and sets its value to 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final dictionary, which contains the frequency of each number in the flattened list1.
<<<Output>>>
{1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}
