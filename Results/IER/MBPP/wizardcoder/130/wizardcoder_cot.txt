Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from collections import defaultdict
def max_occurrences(nums):
    dict = defaultdict(int)
    for i in nums:
        dict[i] += 1
    result = max(dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]) 
    return result[0]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `max_occurrences([2,3,8,4,7,9,8,2,6,5,1,6,1,2,3,2,4,6,9,1,2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable nums is initialized to a list of integers [2,3,8,4,7,9,8,2,6,5,1,6,1,2,3,2,4,6,9,1,2].
The code creates a defaultdict object called dict, which is a dictionary with default value of 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element i in nums.
For each element i, the code increments the value of dict[i] by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code finds the maximum value in the dictionary by using the max() function.
The max() function takes two arguments: the dictionary itself and a key function that returns the value to be compared.
In this case, the key function is a lambda function that returns the second element of each tuple (i.e., the value of the dictionary).
The lambda function is defined using the keyword "lambda", which is a shorthand for defining a small function.
The lambda function takes one argument x, which is a tuple containing two elements: the key and the value of the dictionary.
The lambda function returns the second element of the tuple, which is the value of the dictionary.
The max() function returns the key with the maximum value, which is 2 in this case.
<<<Output>>>
2
