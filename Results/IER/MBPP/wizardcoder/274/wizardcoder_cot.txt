Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math  
def even_binomial_Coeff_Sum( n): 
    return (1 << (n - 1)) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(4)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 4.
The code imports the math module, which provides the constant e (approximately 2.718281828459045).
The code defines a function even_binomial_Coeff_Sum that takes a single argument n.
The function returns the sum of the even binomial coefficients, which is calculated using the formula:

sum = (1/2)^n * (1/2)^(n-1) * (1/2)^(n-2) *... * (1/2)^(1)

where the sum is calculated using the formula:

sum = (1/2)^n * (1/2)^(n-2) * (1/2)^(n-4) *... * (1/2)^(0)

The formula for the even binomial coefficient is:

C(n,k) = (2n)! / ((n-k)! * k!)

where n is the total number of objects and k is the number of objects to be chosen.

The formula for the sum of the even binomial coefficients is:

sum = (1/2)^n * (1/2)^(n-2) * (1/2)^(n-4) *... * (1/2)^(0)

Using the formula for the even binomial coefficient, we can calculate the sum of the even binomial coefficients as follows:

sum = (2n)! / ((n-2)! * 2!) + (2n)! / ((n-4)! * 4!) + (2n)! / ((n-6)! * 6!) +... + (2n)! / ((n-2n)! * 2n!)

Simplifying the formula, we get:

sum = (2n)! / ((n-2)! * 2!) * (1/2)^n

where (1/2)^n is the sum of the first n even numbers.

Substituting n=4, we get:

sum = (2 * 4)! / ((4-2)! * 2!) * (1/2)^4

sum = 24 * 16 / 6 * 2^4
