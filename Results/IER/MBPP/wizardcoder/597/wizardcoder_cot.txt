Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
	m = len(arr1)
	n = len(arr2)
	sorted1 = [0] * (m + n)
	i = 0
	j = 0
	d = 0
	while (i < m and j < n):
		if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]):
			sorted1[d] = arr1[i]
			i += 1
		else:
			sorted1[d] = arr2[j]
			j += 1
		d += 1
	while (i < m):
		sorted1[d] = arr1[i]
		d += 1
		i += 1
	while (j < n):
		sorted1[d] = arr2[j]
		d += 1
		j += 1
	return sorted1[k - 1]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `find_kth([2, 3, 6, 7, 9], [1, 4, 8, 10], 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr1 is initialized to [2, 3, 6, 7, 9], and the variable arr2 is initialized to [1, 4, 8, 10].
The variable k is initialized to 5.
The variable m is initialized to the length of arr1, which is 5.
The variable n is initialized to the length of arr2, which is 4.
The variable sorted1 is initialized to an array of length m + n, which is 9 in this case.
The variable i is initialized to 0, and the variable j is initialized to 0.
The variable d is initialized to 0, which is the index of the next element to be added to sorted1.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as i is less than m and j is less than n.
Inside the loop, the code compares the current elements of arr1 and arr2, and adds the smaller one to sorted1.
The code then increments the index of the added element and increments the index of the corresponding array.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another while loop that continues as long as i is less than m.
Inside the loop, the code adds the remaining elements of arr1 to sorted1.
The code then enters another while loop that continues as long as j is less than n.
Inside the loop, the code adds the remaining elements of arr2 to sorted1.
Finally, the code returns the kth element of sorted1, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
