Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_product(arr):   
  n = len(arr)
  mpis = arr[:]
  for i in range(n): 
    current_prod = arr[i]
    j = i + 1
    while j < n:
      if arr[j-1] > arr[j]: 
        break
      current_prod *= arr[j]
      if current_prod > mpis[j]:
        mpis[j] = current_prod 
      j = j + 1
  return max(mpis)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6].
The variable n is initialized to 6, which is the length of the array.
The variable mpis is initialized to a copy of arr.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each index i in this range, it initializes a variable current_prod to arr[i].
It then enters another loop that starts from i+1 and continues until j reaches n.
For each index j in this loop, it checks if arr[j-1] is greater than arr[j]. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If arr[j-1] is not greater than arr[j], it multiplies arr[j] to current_prod.
If current_prod is greater than mpis[j], it updates mpis[j] to current_prod.
After the inner loop finishes, it moves to the next index i+1 and repeats the process.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the maximum value in mpis, which is 15000.
<<<Output>>>
15000
