Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def even_ele(test_tuple, even_fnc): 
	res = tuple() 
	for ele in test_tuple: 
		if isinstance(ele, tuple): 
			res += (even_ele(ele, even_fnc), ) 
		elif even_fnc(ele): 
			res += (ele, ) 
	return res 
def extract_even(test_tuple):
  res = even_ele(test_tuple, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
  return (res) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `extract_even((4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8))`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_tuple is initialized to (4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8).
The function even_ele takes two arguments, test_tuple and even_fnc.
The variable res is initialized to an empty tuple.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in test_tuple.
If the current element is a tuple, the function even_ele is called recursively with the tuple as the argument. The result is added to the tuple res.
If the current element is not a tuple and even_fnc(ele) is True, the current element is added to the tuple res.
After the loop finishes, the function even_ele returns the tuple res.
The function extract_even takes one argument, test_tuple.
The variable res is initialized to even_ele(test_tuple, lambda x: x % 2 == 0).
The function extract_even returns the tuple res.
<<<Output>>>
(4, 6, 8)
