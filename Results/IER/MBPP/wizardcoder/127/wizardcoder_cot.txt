Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def multiply_int(x, y):
    if y < 0:
        return -multiply_int(x, -y)
    elif y == 0:
        return 0
    elif y == 1:
        return x
    else:
        return x + multiply_int(x, y - 1)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `multiply_int(10,20)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 10 and variable y is initialized to 20.
The code checks if y is less than 0. If it is, it calls the multiply_int function recursively with -y as the second argument.
If y is 0, the function returns 0.
If y is 1, the function returns x.
If y is greater than 1, the function returns x added to the result of calling the multiply_int function recursively with x as the first argument and y-1 as the second argument.
After the recursive calls, the final value of y is 20, which is greater than 1. Therefore, the code enters the else block and adds x to the result of calling the multiply_int function recursively with x as the first argument and y-1 as the second argument.
The final value of x is 10 and the final value of y is 20. Therefore, the code enters the else block and adds 10 to the result of calling the multiply_int function recursively with 10 as the first argument and 19 as the second argument.
The final value of x is 10 and the final value of y is 19. Therefore, the code enters the else block and adds 10 to the result of calling the multiply_int function recursively with 10 as the first argument and 18 as the second argument.
The final value of x is 10 and the final value of y is 18. Therefore, the code enters the else block and adds 10 to the result of calling the multiply_int function recursively with 10 as the first argument and 17 as the second argument.
The final value of x is 10 and the final value of y is 17. Therefore, the code enters the else block and adds 10 to the result of calling the multiply_int function recursively with 10 as the first argument and 16 as the second argument.
The final value of x is 10 and the final value of y is 16. Therefore, the code enters the else block and adds 10 to the result of calling the multiply_int function recursively with 10 as the first argument and 15 as the second argument.
The final value of x is
