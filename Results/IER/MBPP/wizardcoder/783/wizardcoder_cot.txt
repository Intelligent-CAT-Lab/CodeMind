Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def rgb_to_hsv(r, g, b):
    r, g, b = r/255.0, g/255.0, b/255.0
    mx = max(r, g, b)
    mn = min(r, g, b)
    df = mx-mn
    if mx == mn:
        h = 0
    elif mx == r:
        h = (60 * ((g-b)/df) + 360) % 360
    elif mx == g:
        h = (60 * ((b-r)/df) + 120) % 360
    elif mx == b:
        h = (60 * ((r-g)/df) + 240) % 360
    if mx == 0:
        s = 0
    else:
        s = (df/mx)*100
    v = mx*100
    return h, s, v
<Code>

What would be the return value of `rgb_to_hsv(255, 255, 255)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable r, g, and b are initialized to 255, 255, and 255, respectively.
The code then divides each of these variables by 255.0 to convert them to floating point numbers between 0 and 1.
The code then calculates the maximum and minimum values of the three variables, and stores them in mx and mn, respectively.
The code then calculates the difference between mx and mn, and stores it in df.
The code then checks if mx is equal to mn. If it is, the code sets the value of h to 0.
If mx is not equal to mn, the code calculates the value of h based on the following conditions:
- If mx is equal to r, the code calculates h as (60 * ((g-b)/df) + 360) % 360
- If mx is equal to g, the code calculates h as (60 * ((b-r)/df) + 120) % 360
- If mx is equal to b, the code calculates h as (60 * ((r-g)/df) + 240) % 360
The code then calculates the value of s based on the following condition:
- If mx is equal to 0, the code sets the value of s to 0.
- Otherwise, the code calculates s as (df/mx)*100.
The code then calculates the value of v as mx*100.
The code then returns the values of h, s, and v as a tuple.
<<<Output>>>
(0, 0, 100)
