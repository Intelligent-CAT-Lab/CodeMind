Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_run_uppercase(test_str):
  cnt = 0
  res = 0
  for idx in range(0, len(test_str)):
    if test_str[idx].isupper():
      cnt += 1
    else:
      res = cnt
      cnt = 0
  if test_str[len(test_str) - 1].isupper():
    res = cnt
  return (res)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `max_run_uppercase('GeMKSForGERksISBESt')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_str is initialized to 'GeMKSForGERksISBESt'.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of consecutive uppercase letters.
The variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum number of consecutive uppercase letters.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in test_str.
For each character, if it is uppercase, it increments cnt by 1.
If it is not uppercase, it updates res to the maximum of its current value and cnt. It then resets cnt to 0.
After the loop finishes, if the last character in test_str is uppercase, it updates res to cnt.
The code then returns the final value of res, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
