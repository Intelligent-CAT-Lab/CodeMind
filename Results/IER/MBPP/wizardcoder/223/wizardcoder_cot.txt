Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_majority(arr, n, x):
	i = binary_search(arr, 0, n-1, x)
	if i == -1:
		return False
	if ((i + n//2) <= (n -1)) and arr[i + n//2] == x:
		return True
	else:
		return False
def binary_search(arr, low, high, x):
	if high >= low:
		mid = (low + high)//2 
		if (mid == 0 or x > arr[mid-1]) and (arr[mid] == x):
			return mid
		elif x > arr[mid]:
			return binary_search(arr, (mid + 1), high, x)
		else:
			return binary_search(arr, low, (mid -1), x)
	return -1
<Code>

What would be the return value of `is_majority([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10], 7, 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10], which is the input array.
The variable n is initialized to 7, which is the length of the array.
The variable x is initialized to 3, which is the value we are searching for.
The function is_majority is called with the input array arr, length n and value x.
The function binary_search is called with the input array arr, low index 0, high index n-1 and value x.
The binary_search function returns the index of the value x in the array arr.
The is_majority function checks if the value x is present in the array arr and if it is present, it checks if the value x is present at the middle index of the array. If it is present at the middle index, it returns True, else it returns False.
<<<Output>>>
True
