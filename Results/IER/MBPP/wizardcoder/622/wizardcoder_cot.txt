Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_median(arr1, arr2, n):
  i = 0
  j = 0
  m1 = -1
  m2 = -1
  count = 0
  while count < n + 1:
    count += 1
    if i == n:
      m1 = m2
      m2 = arr2[0]
      break
    elif j == n:
      m1 = m2
      m2 = arr1[0]
      break
    if arr1[i] <= arr2[j]:
      m1 = m2
      m2 = arr1[i]
      i += 1
    else:
      m1 = m2
      m2 = arr2[j]
      j += 1
  return (m1 + m2)/2
<Code>

What would be the return value of `get_median([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr1 is initialized to [1, 12, 15, 26, 38], which is the first array of integers.
The variable arr2 is initialized to [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], which is the second array of integers.
The variable n is initialized to 5, which is the number of elements to be considered for median calculation.
The variables i and j are initialized to 0, which are used to iterate through the arrays.
The variables m1 and m2 are initialized to -1, which are used to store the median values.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which is used to keep track of the number of elements considered for median calculation.
The code enters a while loop that continues until count reaches n + 1.
Inside the loop, the code checks if i is equal to n, which means all elements in arr1 have been considered. In this case, the code sets m1 to m2, which is the previous median value, and sets m2 to the first element of arr2.
The code also checks if j is equal to n, which means all elements in arr2 have been considered. In this case, the code sets m1 to m2, which is the previous median value, and sets m2 to the first element of arr1.
If neither of these conditions is met, the code compares the current elements of arr1 and arr2. If arr1[i] is less than or equal to arr2[j], it sets m1 to m2, which is the previous median value, and sets m2 to arr1[i]. It then increments i by 1. If arr2[j] is less than or equal to arr1[i], it sets m1 to m2, which is the previous median value, and sets m2 to arr2[j]. It then increments j by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the median value, which is (m1 + m2)/2.
