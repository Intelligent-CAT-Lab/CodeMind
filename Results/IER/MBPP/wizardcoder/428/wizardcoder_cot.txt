Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def shell_sort(my_list):
    gap = len(my_list) // 2
    while gap > 0:
        for i in range(gap, len(my_list)):
            current_item = my_list[i]
            j = i
            while j >= gap and my_list[j - gap] > current_item:
                my_list[j] = my_list[j - gap]
                j -= gap
            my_list[j] = current_item
        gap //= 2

    return my_list
<Code>

What would be the return value of `shell_sort([12, 23, 4, 5, 3, 2, 12, 81, 56, 95])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable my_list is initialized to [12, 23, 4, 5, 3, 2, 12, 81, 56, 95].
The variable gap is initialized to the length of my_list divided by 2, which is 5.
The code enters a while loop that continues until gap is 0.
Inside the while loop, the code enters another for loop that iterates from gap to the end of my_list.
For each index i in this range, the code assigns the value of my_list[i] to current_item.
The code then enters another while loop that continues until j is less than or equal to gap and my_list[j - gap] is greater than current_item.
Inside the while loop, the code assigns the value of my_list[j - gap] to my_list[j], and decrements j by gap.
Finally, the code assigns the value of current_item to my_list[j], and decrements gap by half.
After the while loop finishes, the code returns the sorted list.
<<<Output>>>
[2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12, 23, 56, 81, 95]
