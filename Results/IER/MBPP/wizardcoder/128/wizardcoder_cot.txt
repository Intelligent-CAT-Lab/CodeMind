Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def long_words(n, str):
    word_len = []
    txt = str.split(" ")
    for x in txt:
        if len(x) > n:
            word_len.append(x)
    return word_len	
<Code>

What would be the return value of `long_words(3,"python is a programming language")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3, which is the maximum length of words to be considered.
The variable str is initialized to "python is a programming language", which is the input string.
The variable word_len is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the words that are longer than n.
The code then splits the input string into a list of words using the split() function.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each word in the list.
For each word x, the code checks if its length is greater than n. If it is, it adds x to the word_len list.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of word_len, which is ["programming"].
<<<Output>>>
["programming"]
