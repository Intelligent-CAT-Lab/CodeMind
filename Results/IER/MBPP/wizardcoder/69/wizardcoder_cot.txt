Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_sublist(l, s):
	sub_set = False
	if s == []:
		sub_set = True
	elif s == l:
		sub_set = True
	elif len(s) > len(l):
		sub_set = False
	else:
		for i in range(len(l)):
			if l[i] == s[0]:
				n = 1
				while (n < len(s)) and (l[i+n] == s[n]):
					n += 1				
				if n == len(s):
					sub_set = True
	return sub_set
<Code>

What would be the return value of `is_sublist([2,4,3,5,7],[3,7])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable l is initialized to [2,4,3,5,7], and the variable s is initialized to [3,7].
The function is_sublist(l, s) is called.
The variable sub_set is initialized to False.
The first if statement checks if s is an empty list. If it is, then sub_set is set to True, since an empty list is always a subset of any list.
The second if statement checks if s is equal to l. If it is, then sub_set is set to True, since l is always a subset of itself.
The third if statement checks if the length of s is greater than the length of l. If it is, then sub_set is set to False, since s cannot be a subset of l.
The fourth if statement is the main logic of the function. It iterates through each element of l, and for each element, it checks if it is equal to the first element of s. If it is, then it checks if the next n elements of l are equal to the next n elements of s. If it is, then sub_set is set to True.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of sub_set, which is True.
<<<Output>>>
True
