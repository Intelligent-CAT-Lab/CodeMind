Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math 
def count_divisors(n) : 
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, (int)(math.sqrt(n)) + 2) : 
        if (n % i == 0) : 
            if( n // i == i) : 
                count = count + 1
            else : 
                count = count + 2
    return count % 2 == 0
<Code>

What would be the return value of `count_divisors(10)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code imports the math module to use the sqrt function.
The code initializes a variable count to 0, which will be used to count the number of divisors.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of n (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it checks if i is a factor of n. If it is, it adds 1 to count. If it is not, it adds 2 to count.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if count is even or odd. If it is even, it returns True. If it is odd, it returns False.
<<<Output>>>
True
