Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from itertools import combinations 
def find_combinations(test_list):
  res = [(b1 + a1, b2 + a2) for (a1, a2), (b1, b2) in combinations(test_list, 2)]
  return (res) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `find_combinations([(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_list is initialized to [(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)].
The code uses the itertools module to generate all possible pairs of elements from the list.
For each pair of elements, it concatenates them to form a new tuple and adds it to a list.
The final list contains all possible combinations of the elements in the input list.
The code returns this list as the output.
<<<Output>>>
[(2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 10), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 10), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 10), (7, 10)]
