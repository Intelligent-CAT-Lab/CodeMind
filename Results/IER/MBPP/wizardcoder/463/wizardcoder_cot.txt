Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_subarray_product(arr):
	n = len(arr)
	max_ending_here = 1
	min_ending_here = 1
	max_so_far = 0
	flag = 0
	for i in range(0, n):
		if arr[i] > 0:
			max_ending_here = max_ending_here * arr[i]
			min_ending_here = min (min_ending_here * arr[i], 1)
			flag = 1
		elif arr[i] == 0:
			max_ending_here = 1
			min_ending_here = 1
		else:
			temp = max_ending_here
			max_ending_here = max (min_ending_here * arr[i], 1)
			min_ending_here = temp * arr[i]
		if (max_so_far < max_ending_here):
			max_so_far = max_ending_here
	if flag == 0 and max_so_far == 0:
		return 0
	return max_so_far
<Code>

What would be the return value of `max_subarray_product([1, -2, -3, 0, 7, -8, -2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [1, -2, -3, 0, 7, -8, -2].
The variable n is initialized to 7.
The variables max_ending_here, min_ending_here, max_so_far and flag are initialized to 1, 1, 0 and 0, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each element arr[i] in the array, the code performs the following operations:
- If arr[i] is greater than 0, it multiplies max_ending_here by arr[i] and stores the result in max_ending_here. It also multiplies min_ending_here by arr[i] and stores the result in min_ending_here, but only if it is less than or equal to 1. This is because if arr[i] is negative, it will only decrease the product of the previous elements, so we need to make sure that min_ending_here is not negative.
- If arr[i] is equal to 0, it sets max_ending_here to 1 and min_ending_here to 1, which are the base cases for the algorithm.
- If arr[i] is negative, it multiplies max_ending_here by arr[i] and stores the result in temp. It then sets max_ending_here to the maximum between min_ending_here and 1, multiplied by arr[i]. It also sets min_ending_here to temp multiplied by arr[i]. This is because if arr[i] is negative, it will only decrease the product of the previous elements, so we need to make sure that min_ending_here is not negative.
- If max_ending_here is greater than max_so_far, it updates max_so_far with the value of max_ending_here.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if max_so_far is equal to 0 and flag is equal to 0. If both conditions are true, it means that the array contains only negative numbers, so the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns max_so_far.
