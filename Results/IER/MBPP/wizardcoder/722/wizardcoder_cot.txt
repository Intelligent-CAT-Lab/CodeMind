Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def filter_data(students,h,w):
    result = {k: s for k, s in students.items() if s[0] >=h and s[1] >=w}
    return result    
<Code>

What would be the return value of `filter_data({'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70), 'Alden Cantrell': (5.9, 65), 'Kierra Gentry': (6.0, 68), 'Pierre Cox': (5.8, 66)},6.0,70)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable students is initialized to a dictionary with four key-value pairs. Each key is a string representing a student name, and each value is a tuple with two elements representing the student's height and weight.
The variable h is initialized to 6.0, and the variable w is initialized to 70.
The code then creates an empty dictionary called result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary students. For each pair, it checks if the first element of the value (i.e., the student's height) is greater than or equal to h and if the second element of the value (i.e., the student's weight) is greater than or equal to w. If both conditions are met, it adds the key-value pair to the result dictionary.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of result, which is a dictionary with two key-value pairs. The first key is 'Alden Cantrell', and the corresponding value is (5.9, 65). The second key is 'Pierre Cox', and the corresponding value is (5.8, 66).
<<<Output>>>
{'Alden Cantrell': (5.9, 65), 'Pierre Cox': (5.8, 66)}
