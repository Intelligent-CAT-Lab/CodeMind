Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def rearrange_bigger(n):
    nums = list(str(n))
    for i in range(len(nums)-2,-1,-1):
        if nums[i] < nums[i+1]:
            z = nums[i:]
            y = min(filter(lambda x: x > z[0], z))
            z.remove(y)
            z.sort()
            nums[i:] = [y] + z
            return int("".join(nums))
    return False
<Code>

What would be the return value of `rearrange_bigger(12)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 12.
The code converts the number to a list of digits and stores it in the variable nums.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the last digit to the second last digit (inclusive).
For each digit i in this range, it checks if the digit is smaller than the next digit. If it is, it proceeds to the next step.
If the digit is not smaller than the next digit, it finds the smallest digit greater than the current digit and swaps it with the current digit. It then sorts the remaining digits in ascending order and concatenates them to the left of the current digit to form a new list of digits.
The code then converts the new list of digits back to an integer and returns it.
If the loop finishes without finding a suitable digit to swap, it returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
