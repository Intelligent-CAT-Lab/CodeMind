Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def maxAverageOfPath(cost):
  N = len(cost)
  dp = [[0 for i in range(N + 1)] for j in range(N + 1)]
  dp[0][0] = cost[0][0]
  for i in range(1, N):
    dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + cost[i][0]
  for j in range(1, N):
    dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + cost[0][j]
  for i in range(1, N):
    for j in range(1, N):
      dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j],
                     dp[i][j - 1]) + cost[i][j]
  return dp[N - 1][N - 1] / (2 * N - 1)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable cost is initialized to a 2D list with the values [[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]].
The variable N is initialized to the length of the cost list, which is 3.
The variable dp is initialized to a 2D list with the same dimensions as cost, with all values initialized to 0.
The first row and first column of dp are initialized to the values of the first row and first column of cost, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the cost matrix.
For each path, it calculates the maximum cost of the path by considering the cost of the current cell and the cost of the path that reaches the current cell from either the cell above or the cell to the left.
The maximum cost is stored in dp[i][j].
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of dp[N - 1][N - 1], which is the maximum cost of the path that reaches the bottom-right corner from the top-left corner.
The final value is then divided by 2 * N - 1 to get the average cost of the path.
<<<Output>>>
12.0
