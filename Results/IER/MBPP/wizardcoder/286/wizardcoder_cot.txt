Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_sub_array_sum_repeated(a, n, k): 
	max_so_far = -2147483648
	max_ending_here = 0
	for i in range(n*k): 
		max_ending_here = max_ending_here + a[i%n] 
		if (max_so_far < max_ending_here): 
			max_so_far = max_ending_here 
		if (max_ending_here < 0): 
			max_ending_here = 0
	return max_so_far
<Code>

What would be the return value of `max_sub_array_sum_repeated([10, 20, -30, -1], 4, 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized to [10, 20, -30, -1], which is the input array.
The variable n is initialized to 4, which is the length of the input array.
The variable k is initialized to 3, which is the number of times the input array should be repeated.

The variable max_so_far is initialized to -2147483648, which is the smallest possible integer value.
The variable max_ending_here is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the maximum sum of a subarray.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n*k (exclusive), meaning it will consider all possible subarrays of length k.
For each subarray, it calculates the sum of its elements and stores it in max_ending_here.
If max_ending_here is greater than max_so_far, it updates max_so_far to max_ending_here.
If max_ending_here becomes negative, it resets it to 0, since a negative sum cannot be part of a subarray.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of max_so_far, which is 20.
<<<Output>>>
20
