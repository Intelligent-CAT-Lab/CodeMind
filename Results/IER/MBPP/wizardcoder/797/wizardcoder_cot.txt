Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_odd(n): 
    terms = (n + 1)//2
    sum1 = terms * terms 
    return sum1  
def sum_in_range(l,r): 
    return sum_odd(r) - sum_odd(l - 1)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `sum_in_range(2,5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5, which is the upper limit of the range.
The variable terms is calculated as (n + 1)//2, which is 3.
The variable sum1 is calculated as terms * terms, which is 9.
The function sum_odd(n) returns the sum of odd numbers from 1 to n.
The function sum_in_range(l,r) calculates the sum of odd numbers in the range [l,r] by subtracting the sum of odd numbers in the range [1,l-1] from the sum of odd numbers in the range [1,r].
The function sum_odd(r) returns the sum of odd numbers from 1 to r, which is 9.
The function sum_odd(l - 1) returns the sum of odd numbers from 1 to l-1, which is 1.
The function sum_in_range(2,5) returns the sum of odd numbers in the range [2,5], which is 9 - 1 = 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
