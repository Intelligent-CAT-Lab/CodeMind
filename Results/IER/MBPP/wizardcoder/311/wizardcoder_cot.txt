Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n): 
    if not (n & (n + 1)): 
        return n 
    pos, temp, count = 0, n, 0 
    while temp: 
        if not (temp & 1): 
            pos = count      
        count += 1; temp>>=1
    return (n | (1 << (pos))) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `set_left_most_unset_bit(10)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code checks if n has a leftmost unset bit. This can be done by checking if n and n+1 have a common set bit. If they don't have a common set bit, then n has a leftmost unset bit.
If n has a leftmost unset bit, the code calculates the position of the leftmost unset bit and sets it to 1. This can be done by counting the number of set bits in n and then setting the bit at that position to 1.
If n doesn't have a leftmost unset bit, the code returns n.
<<<Output>>>
10
