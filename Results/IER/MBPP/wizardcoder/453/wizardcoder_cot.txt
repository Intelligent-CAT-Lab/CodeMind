Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math 
def sumofFactors(n) : 
    if (n % 2!= 0) : 
        return 0
    res = 1
    for i in range(2, (int)(math.sqrt(n)) + 1) :    
        count = 0
        curr_sum = 1
        curr_term = 1
        while (n % i == 0) : 
            count= count + 1
            n = n // i 
            if (i == 2 and count == 1) : 
                curr_sum = 0
            curr_term = curr_term * i 
            curr_sum = curr_sum + curr_term 
        res = res * curr_sum  
    if (n >= 2) : 
        res = res * (1 + n) 
    return res
<Code>

What would be the return value of `sumofFactors(18)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 18.
The code checks if n is odd. Since n is even, the code returns 0.
The code initializes a variable res to 1, which will be used to accumulate the sum of factors.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it calculates the count of factors of i in n, and stores it in count.
The code then divides n by i, and calculates the product of the current term and the sum of factors of i in n.
If i is 2 and count is 1, it means that i is a prime factor of n, and the code sets curr_sum to 0.
The code then updates the current term and the sum of factors.
After the loop finishes, the code updates the final value of res by multiplying it with the sum of factors of n.
If n is greater than or equal to 2, the code adds 1 to the final value of res.
The code returns the final value of res, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
