Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def unique_sublists(list1):
    result ={}
    for l in list1: 
        result.setdefault(tuple(l), list()).append(1) 
    for a, b in result.items(): 
        result[a] = sum(b)
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `unique_sublists([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [13, 15, 17], [5, 7], [9, 11]])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable list1 is initialized to [[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [13, 15, 17], [5, 7], [9, 11]].
The variable result is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each sublist l in list1.
For each sublist l, the code creates a key in the dictionary result with the tuple representation of l as the key and an empty list as the value.
The code then appends 1 to the list value associated with the key tuple(l).
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary result.
For each key-value pair, the code calculates the sum of the list value and stores it back in the dictionary result.
After the second loop finishes, the code returns the final value of the dictionary result, which is { (1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1, (9, 11): 1 }.
<<<Output>>>
{ (1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1, (9, 11): 1 }
