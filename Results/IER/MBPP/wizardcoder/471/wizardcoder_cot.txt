Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_remainder(arr, n): 
    mul = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):  
        mul = (mul * (arr[i] % n)) % n 
    return mul % n 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],11)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ], and variable n is initialized to 11.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 5 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the first 6 elements of arr.
For each element arr[i] in this range, it calculates the remainder of arr[i] divided by n, and multiplies it with the current value of mul.
The code then updates the value of mul to the remainder of the previous value of mul multiplied by the remainder of arr[i] divided by n.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of mul, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
