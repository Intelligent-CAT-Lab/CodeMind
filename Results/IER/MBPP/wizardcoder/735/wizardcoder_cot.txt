Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def set_middle_bits(n):  
    n |= n >> 1; 
    n |= n >> 2; 
    n |= n >> 4; 
    n |= n >> 8; 
    n |= n >> 16;  
    return (n >> 1) ^ 1
def toggle_middle_bits(n): 
    if (n == 1): 
        return 1
    return n ^ set_middle_bits(n) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `toggle_middle_bits(9)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 9.
The function set_middle_bits(n) is called.
The variable n is first bitwise ORed with n shifted right by 1, which is equivalent to multiplying n by 2.
The variable n is then bitwise ORed with n shifted right by 2, which is equivalent to multiplying n by 4.
The variable n is then bitwise ORed with n shifted right by 4, which is equivalent to multiplying n by 16.
The variable n is then bitwise ORed with n shifted right by 8, which is equivalent to multiplying n by 256.
The variable n is then bitwise ORed with n shifted right by 16, which is equivalent to multiplying n by 65536.
The function returns the value of n shifted right by 1, which is equivalent to dividing n by 2 and then bitwise XORing it with 1.
The function toggle_middle_bits(n) is called with n equal to 9.
The function checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns 1.
If n is not equal to 1, the function returns n XOR set_middle_bits(n).
