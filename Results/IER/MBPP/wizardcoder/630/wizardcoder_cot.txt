Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def adjac(ele, sub = []): 
  if not ele: 
     yield sub 
  else: 
     yield from [idx for j in range(ele[0] - 1, ele[0] + 2) 
                for idx in adjac(ele[1:], sub + [j])] 
def get_coordinates(test_tup):
  return list(adjac(test_tup))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `get_coordinates((3, 4))`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable ele is initialized to (3, 4).
The variable sub is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a recursive function adjac that takes two arguments: ele and sub.
If ele is an empty list, the function yields sub, which is an empty list.
Otherwise, the function uses a nested loop to generate all possible adjacent coordinates for the first element of ele, and recursively calls itself with the remaining elements of ele and the current adjacent coordinate appended to sub.
The function then yields all the results generated by this recursive call.
The code then calls the function get_coordinates with the argument (3, 4).
The function then generates all possible adjacent coordinates for (3, 4) using the adjac function, and returns them as a list.
The final value of the list is [[(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)], [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)]].
<<<Output>>>
[[(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)], [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)]]
