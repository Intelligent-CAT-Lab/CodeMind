Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def last(arr,x):
    n = len(arr)
    low = 0
    high = n - 1
    res = -1  
    while (low <= high):
        mid = (low + high) // 2 
        if arr[mid] > x:
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            res = mid
            low = mid + 1
    return res
<Code>

What would be the return value of `last([1,2,3],1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [1,2,3], and variable x is initialized to 1.
The variable n is initialized to the length of arr, which is 3.
The variables low and high are initialized to 0 and n-1, respectively.
The variable res is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the index of the last occurrence of x in arr.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as low is less than or equal to high.
The variable mid is calculated as the average of low and high, rounded down to the nearest integer.
If arr[mid] is greater than x, the code sets high to mid-1, since all elements to the left of mid are guaranteed to be less than x.
If arr[mid] is less than x, the code sets low to mid+1, since all elements to the right of mid are guaranteed to be greater than x.
If arr[mid] is equal to x, the code sets res to mid, since we have found the last occurrence of x in arr.
The code then sets low to mid+1, since we have already found the last occurrence of x in the left half of arr.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of res, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
