Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):
    result = []
    for m, n, o in zip(l1, l2, l3):
        if (m == n == o):
            result.append(m)
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `extract_index_list([1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable l1, l2 and l3 are initialized to [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7] and [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7], respectively.
The variable result is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the indices of the elements that meet the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the three lists using the zip function, meaning it will iterate over the corresponding elements of the three lists.
For each triplet (m, n, o) in this loop, it checks if all three elements are equal. If they are, it adds the first element m to the result list.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of result, which is [1].
<<<Output>>>
[1]
