Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
  for m in re.finditer(r"\w+ly", text):
    return ('%d-%d: %s' % (m.start(), m.end(), m.group(0)))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `find_adverbs("Clearly, he has no excuse for such behavior.")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to "Clearly, he has no excuse for such behavior.".
The code then imports the re module, which provides support for regular expressions.
The code then defines a function called find_adverbs that takes a string argument text.
The code then enters a loop that uses the re.finditer() function to find all occurrences of the regular expression "\w+ly" in the text.
For each match found, the code returns a string that includes the starting and ending positions of the match, as well as the matched text itself.
The code then returns the first match found, which is "Clearly" in this case.
<<<Output>>>
0-7: Clearly
