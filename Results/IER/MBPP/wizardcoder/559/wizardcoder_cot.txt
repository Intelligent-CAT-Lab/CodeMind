Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_sub_array_sum(a, size):
  max_so_far = 0
  max_ending_here = 0
  for i in range(0, size):
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + a[i]
    if max_ending_here < 0:
      max_ending_here = 0
    elif (max_so_far < max_ending_here):
      max_so_far = max_ending_here
  return max_so_far
<Code>

What would be the return value of `max_sub_array_sum([-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3], 8)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized to [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3], and size is initialized to 8.
max_so_far is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum sum of subarray seen so far.
max_ending_here is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum sum of subarray ending at the current position.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to size-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all elements of the array.
For each element a[i] in the array, it calculates the maximum sum of subarray ending at the current position by adding a[i] to max_ending_here. If max_ending_here becomes negative, it is reset to 0, since a negative sum cannot be part of a subarray. If max_ending_here becomes greater than max_so_far, it updates max_so_far to max_ending_here.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of max_so_far, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
