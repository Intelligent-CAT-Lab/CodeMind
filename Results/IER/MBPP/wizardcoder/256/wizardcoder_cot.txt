Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def count_Primes_nums(n):
    ctr = 0
    for num in range(n):
        if num <= 1:
            continue
        for i in range(2,num):
            if (num % i) == 0:
                break
        else:
            ctr += 1
    return ctr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `count_Primes_nums(5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable ctr is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of prime numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number num in this range, it checks if it is less than or equal to 1, which is not a prime number. If it is, it skips to the next number.
If num is greater than 1, the code enters another loop that iterates from 2 to num-1 (inclusive), meaning it will check if num is divisible by any number between 2 and num-1.
If num is divisible by any number in this range, it breaks out of the inner loop and moves on to the next number.
If num is not divisible by any number in this range, it means it is a prime number, so it increments the counter ctr.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ctr, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
