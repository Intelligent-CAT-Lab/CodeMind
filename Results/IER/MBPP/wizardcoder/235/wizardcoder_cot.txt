Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    count = 0;res = 0;temp = n 
    while(temp > 0): 
        if (count % 2 == 1): 
            res |= (1 << count)
        count+=1
        temp >>= 1
    return (n | res) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `even_bit_set_number(10)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of bits set in the binary representation of n.
The variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the bits set in the binary representation of n.
The variable temp is initialized to n, which will be used to extract the rightmost bit of n and shift it to the right.
The code enters a loop that continues until temp is 0.
Inside the loop, the code checks if count is odd. If it is, it sets the bit at position count in res to 1.
The code increments count by 1.
The code shifts temp to the right by 1 bit.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the result of n OR res, which is 10 OR 000000000000000000000000000001010 in binary.
<<<Output>>>
10
