Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_total_number_of_sequences(m,n): 
	T=[[0 for i in range(n+1)] for i in range(m+1)] 
	for i in range(m+1): 
		for j in range(n+1): 
			if i==0 or j==0: 
				T[i][j]=0
			elif i<j: 
				T[i][j]=0
			elif j==1: 
				T[i][j]=i 
			else: 
				T[i][j]=T[i-1][j]+T[i//2][j-1] 
	return T[m][n]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable m and variable n are initialized to 10 and 4, respectively.
The variable T is initialized as a 2D list with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1), where each element is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of i and j, where 0 <= i <= m and 0 <= j <= n.
If i=0 or j=0, then T[i][j] is set to 0, since there are no sequences of length 0 or 1.
If i<j, then T[i][j] is set to 0, since there are no sequences of length greater than 1.
If j=1, then T[i][j] is set to i, since there is only one sequence of length 1.
Otherwise, T[i][j] is set to T[i-1][j]+T[i//2][j-1], which is the sum of all possible sequences of length j that can be formed using numbers from 1 to i.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of T[m][n], which is the total number of sequences of length n that can be formed using numbers from 1 to m.
<<<Output>>>
120
