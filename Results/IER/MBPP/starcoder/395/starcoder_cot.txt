Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def first_non_repeating_character(str1):
  char_order = []
  ctr = {}
  for c in str1:
    if c in ctr:
      ctr[c] += 1
    else:
      ctr[c] = 1 
      char_order.append(c)
  for c in char_order:
    if ctr[c] == 1:
      return c
  return None

What would be the return value of `first_non_repeating_character("abcabc")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable str1 is initialized to "abcabc", which is a string.
The variable char_order is initialized to an empty list.
The variable ctr is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c in str1.
If c is already in the dictionary ctr, it adds 1 to the value of c.
Otherwise, it adds c to the dictionary ctr with a value of 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over each character c in char_order.
If the value of c in ctr is 1, it returns c.
Otherwise, it returns None.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of c, which is None.
<<<Output>>>
None

  for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
      sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    sum_1 += sum_order
  return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_digits(20)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 20.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code adds sum_order to sum_1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 105.
<<<Output>>>
