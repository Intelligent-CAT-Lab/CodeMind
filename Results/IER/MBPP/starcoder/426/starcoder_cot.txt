Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def filter_oddnumbers(nums):
 odd_nums = list(filter(lambda x: x%2!= 0, nums))
 return odd_nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `filter_oddnumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable nums is initialized to a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the list nums.
For each number in the list, it checks if the number is odd.
If the number is odd, it adds it to the list odd_nums.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of odd_nums, which is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
