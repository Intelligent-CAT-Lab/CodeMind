Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def count_bidirectional(test_list):
  res = 0
  for idx in range(0, len(test_list)):
    for iidx in range(idx + 1, len(test_list)):
      if test_list[iidx][0] == test_list[idx][1] and test_list[idx][1] == test_list[iidx][0]:
        res += 1
  return res
<Code>

What would be the return value of `count_bidirectional([(5, 6), (1, 2), (6, 5), (9, 1), (6, 5), (2, 1)] )`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_list is initialized to [(5, 6), (1, 2), (6, 5), (9, 1), (6, 5), (2, 1)].
The variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of bidirectional pairs.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of test_list.
For each index idx in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from idx + 1 to the length of test_list.
For each index iidx in this range, it checks if the first element of test_list at index idx is equal to the second element of test_list at index iidx, and if the second element of test_list at index idx is equal to the first element of test_list at index iidx.
If all three conditions are met, it adds 1 to res.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of res, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

        res += 1
  return res

What would be the return value of `count_bidirectional_2([(5, 6), (1, 2), (6, 5), (9, 1), (6, 5), (2, 1)] )`?
