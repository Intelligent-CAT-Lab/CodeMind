Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):
    result = []
    for m, n, o in zip(l1, l2, l3):
        if (m == n == o):
            result.append(m)
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `extract_index_list([1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable l1, l2 and l3 are initialized to [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7], respectively.
variable result is initialized to [], which will be used to store the result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the lists l1, l2 and l3 simultaneously.
For each element m, n and o in the lists, it checks if m, n and o are equal. If they are, it adds m to the result.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of result, which is [1, 3, 7].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 7]
