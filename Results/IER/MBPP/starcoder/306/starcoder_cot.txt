Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
	dp = [[0 for i in range(n)] 
			for i in range(n)]
	for i in range(n):
		if a[i] > a[0]:
			dp[0][i] = a[i] + a[0]
		else:
			dp[0][i] = a[i]
	for i in range(1, n):
		for j in range(n):
			if a[j] > a[i] and j > i:
				if dp[i - 1][i] + a[j] > dp[i - 1][j]:
					dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][i] + a[j]
				else:
					dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
			else:
				dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
	return dp[index][k]

What would be the return value of `max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5 ], 7, 4, 6)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable n, variable index and variable k are initialized to [1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5 ], 7, 4, 6, respectively.
The variable dp is initialized to a 2-dimensional array with 7 rows and 7 columns.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it checks if a[i] is greater than a[0]. If it is, it adds a[i] and a[0] to dp[0][i]. If it is not, it adds a[i] to dp[0][i].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 6.
For each number j in this range, it checks if a[j] is greater than a[i] and j is greater than i. If it is, it checks if dp[i-1][i] + a[j] is greater than dp[i-1][j]. If it is, it adds dp[i-1][i] + a[j] to dp[i][j]. If it is not, it adds dp[i-1][j] to dp[i][j].
The code then returns the final value of dp[index][k], which is 107.
<<<Output>>>
