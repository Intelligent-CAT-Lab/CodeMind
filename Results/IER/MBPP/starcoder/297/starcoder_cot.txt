Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def flatten_list(list1):
    result_list = []
    if not list1: return result_list
    stack = [list(list1)]
    while stack:
        c_num = stack.pop()
        next = c_num.pop()
        if c_num: stack.append(c_num)
        if isinstance(next, list):
            if next: stack.append(list(next))
        else: result_list.append(next)
    result_list.reverse()
    return result_list 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `flatten_list([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable list1 is initialized to [0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]].
The variable result_list is initialized to [].
The variable stack is initialized to [list(list1)], which is [[0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]].
The code then enters a loop that iterates until stack is empty.
The code pops the last element of stack and assigns it to c_num.
The code then checks if c_num is empty. If it is, the code exits the loop.
If c_num is not empty, the code pushes c_num back to stack.
The code then checks if next is a list. If it is, the code pushes the list next to stack.
If next is not a list, the code appends next to result_list.
After the loop finishes, the code reverses result_list and returns it.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
