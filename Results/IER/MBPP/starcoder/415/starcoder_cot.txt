Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_Product(arr): 
    arr_len = len(arr) 
    if (arr_len < 2): 
        return ("No pairs exists")           
    x = arr[0]; y = arr[1]      
    for i in range(0,arr_len): 
        for j in range(i + 1,arr_len): 
            if (arr[i] * arr[j] > x * y): 
                x = arr[i]; y = arr[j] 
    return x,y    
<Code>

What would be the return value of `max_Product([1,2,3,4,7,0,8,4])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [1,2,3,4,7,0,8,4].
The variable arr_len is initialized to 8.
The code then checks if arr_len is less than 2. If it is, it returns "No pairs exists".
If arr_len is greater than or equal to 2, the code proceeds to initialize x to arr[0] and y to arr[1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to arr_len (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 7.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from i+1 to arr_len (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from i+1 to 7.
For each number j in this range, it checks if arr[i] * arr[j] is greater than x * y. If it is, it updates x to arr[i] and y to arr[j].
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final values of x and y, which are 7 and 8.
<<<Output>>>
(7, 8)
