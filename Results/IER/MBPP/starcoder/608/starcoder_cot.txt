Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def bell_Number(n): 
    bell = [[0 for i in range(n+1)] for j in range(n+1)] 
    bell[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]
        for j in range(1, i+1): 
            bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1] 
    return bell[n][0] 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `bell_Number(2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable bell is initialized to a 2-dimensional array with 2 rows and n+1 columns.
The first row and the first column of bell are initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, the first row and the first column of bell are updated to 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to i (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number j in this range, the first row and the first column of bell are updated to 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to j (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number k in this range, the first row and the first column of bell are updated to 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number l in this range, the first row and the first column of bell are updated to 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to l (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number m in this range, the first row and the first column of bell are updated to 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number n in this range, the first row and the first column of bell are updated to 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number o in this range, the first row and the first column of bell are updated to 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to o (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number p in this range, the first row and the first column of bell are updated to 1.
