Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    C = [0] * (k + 1); 
    C[0] = 1; # nC0 is 1 
    for i in range(1,n + 1):  
        for j in range(min(i, k),0,-1): 
            C[j] = C[j] + C[j - 1]; 
    return C[k]; 
def sum_Of_product(n): 
    return binomial_Coeff(2 * n,n - 1); 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `sum_Of_product(3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The function binomial_Coeff is called with n and k as parameters.
The function binomial_Coeff returns a list C with k + 1 elements.
The first element of C is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from min(i, k) to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from min(i, k) to 0.
For each number j in this range, it adds the value of C[j] to C[j - 1].
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of C[k], which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

    return sum_1*sum_1
def difference(n):
    return square_of_sum(n) - sum_of_squares(n)
</Code>
What would be the return value of `difference(10)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
