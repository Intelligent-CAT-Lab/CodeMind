Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def group_tuples(Input): 
	out = {} 
	for elem in Input: 
		try: 
			out[elem[0]].extend(elem[1:]) 
		except KeyError: 
			out[elem[0]] = list(elem) 
	return [tuple(values) for values in out.values()] 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `group_tuples([('x', 'y'), ('x', 'z'), ('w', 't')])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable Input is initialized to [('x', 'y'), ('x', 'z'), ('w', 't')].
The variable out is initialized to {}.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of Input.
For each element elem in Input, it tries to add the second element of elem to the list of the first element of elem.
If the first element of elem is not in out, it adds the first element of elem to out as a key and the second element of elem as a value.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the list of tuples in out.values(), which is [('y', 'z'), ('t',)].
<<<Output>>>
[('y', 'z'), ('t',)]

            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        sum_1 += sum_order
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_digits(20)`?
