Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_negativenum(nums):
  sum_negativenum = list(filter(lambda nums:nums<0,nums))
  return sum(sum_negativenum)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `sum_negativenum([2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable nums is initialized to [2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17].
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the list nums.
For each number in nums, it checks if the number is less than 0.
If the number is less than 0, it adds the number to a new list sum_negativenum.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_negativenum, which is [-6, -9, -12, -5].
<<<Output>>>
-32

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_even_numbers(nums):
  sum_even = list(filter(lambda nums:nums%2==0,nums))
  return sum(sum_even)

What would be the return value of `sum_of_even_numbers([2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The variable nums is initialized to [2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17].
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the list nums.
For each number in nums, it checks if the number is even.
If the number is even, it adds the number to a new list sum_even.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_even, which is [2, 4, -12, -5, 14].
