Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from collections import deque
def check_expression(exp):
    if len(exp) & 1:
        return False
    stack = deque()
    for ch in exp:
        if ch == '(' or ch == '{' or ch == '[':
            stack.append(ch)
        if ch == ')' or ch == '}' or ch == ']':
            if not stack:
                return False
            top = stack.pop()
            if (top == '(' and ch!= ')') or (top == '{' and ch!= '}' or (top == '[' and ch!= ']')):
                return False
    return not stack
<Code>

What would be the return value of `check_expression("{()}[{}]")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable exp is initialized to "{()}[{}]", which is a string.
The code then checks if the length of exp is odd. If it is, the code returns False.
If the length of exp is even, the code enters a loop that iterates over each character in exp.
For each character ch, the code checks if ch is one of the following: '(', '{', '['. If it is, it appends ch to the stack.
If ch is one of the following: ')', '}', ']', the code checks if the stack is empty. If it is, the code returns False.
If the stack is not empty, it pops the top element from the stack and stores it in the variable top.
The code then checks if top is one of the following: '(', '{', '['. If it is, it checks if ch is one of the following: ')', '}', ']'. If it is not, the code returns False.
If the code has not returned False yet, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, the code returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
