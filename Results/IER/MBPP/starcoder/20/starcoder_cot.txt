Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_woodall(x): 
	if (x % 2 == 0): 
		return False
	if (x == 1): 
		return True
	x = x + 1 
	p = 0
	while (x % 2 == 0): 
		x = x/2
		p = p + 1
		if (p == x): 
			return True
	return False
<Code>

What would be the return value of `is_woodall(383)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 383.
The code checks if x is even. Since 383 is odd, the code returns False.
The code then checks if x is equal to 1. Since 383 is not 1, the code returns False.
The code then adds 1 to x. The value of x is now 384.
The code then initializes a variable p to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until x is no longer even.
The code divides x by 2. The value of x is now 192.
The code increments p by 1. The value of p is now 1.
The code checks if p is equal to x. Since 192 is not 192, the code returns False.
The code then returns True.
<<<Output>>>
False
