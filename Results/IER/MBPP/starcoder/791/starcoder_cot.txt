Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def remove_nested(test_tup):
  res = tuple()
  for count, ele in enumerate(test_tup):
    if not isinstance(ele, tuple):
      res = res + (ele, )
  return (res) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `remove_nested((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10))`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_tup is initialized to (1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10).
The variable res is initialized to an empty tuple.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of test_tup.
For each element ele in test_tup, it checks if ele is a tuple. If it is not, it adds ele to res.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of res, which is (1, 5, 7, 4, 6, 10).
<<<Output>>>
(1, 5, 7, 4, 6, 10)

            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        sum_1 += sum_order
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_digits(20)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N is initialized to 20.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
