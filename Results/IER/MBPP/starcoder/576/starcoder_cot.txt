Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

def is_Sub_Array(A,B): 
    n = len(A)
    m = len(B)
    i = 0; j = 0; 
    while (i < n and j < m):  
        if (A[i] == B[j]): 
            i += 1; 
            j += 1; 
            if (j == m): 
                return True;  
        else: 
            i = i - j + 1; 
            j = 0;       
    return False;

What would be the return value of `is_Sub_Array([1,4,3,5],[1,2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A is initialized to [1,4,3,5], and variable B is initialized to [1,2].
The variable n is initialized to 4, and variable m is initialized to 2.
The variable i is initialized to 0, and variable j is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues until i is less than n and j is less than m.
The code checks if A[i] is equal to B[j]. If it is, it increments i by 1 and j by 1. If j is equal to m, the code returns True.
If A[i] is not equal to B[j], the code decrements i by j+1 and resets j to 0.
After the loop finishes, the code returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
