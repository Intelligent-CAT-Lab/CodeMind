Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def amicable_numbers_sum(limit):
    if not isinstance(limit, int):
        return "Input is not an integer!"
    if limit < 1:
        return "Input must be bigger than 0!"
    amicables = set()
    for num in range(2, limit+1):
        if num in amicables:
            continue
        sum_fact = sum([fact for fact in range(1, num) if num % fact == 0])
        sum_fact2 = sum([fact for fact in range(1, sum_fact) if sum_fact % fact == 0])
        if num == sum_fact2 and num!= sum_fact:
            amicables.add(num)
            amicables.add(sum_fact2)
    return sum(amicables)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `amicable_numbers_sum(999)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable limit is initialized to 999.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to limit (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 999.
For each number num in this range, it calculates the sum of its factors and stores it in sum_fact.
It also calculates the sum of the factors of sum_fact and stores it in sum_fact2.
The code checks if num is equal to sum_fact2 and num is not equal to sum_fact. If it is, it adds num and sum_fact2 to the set amicables.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the sum of the set amicables, which is 31626.
<<<Output>>>
31626

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_squares(limit):
    if not isinstance(limit, int):
        return "Input is not an integer!"
    if limit < 1:
        return "Input must be bigger than 0!"
    sum_squares = 0
    for i in range(1, limit+1):
        sum_squares += i**2
    return sum_squares
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_squares(10)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable limit is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to limit (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it adds i to the variable sum_squares.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_squares, which is 385.
<<<Output>>>
