Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def swap_List(newList): 
    size = len(newList) 
    temp = newList[0] 
    newList[0] = newList[size - 1] 
    newList[size - 1] = temp   
    return newList 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `swap_List([1,2,3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable newList is initialized to [1,2,3].
The variable size is initialized to the length of newList, which is 3.
The variable temp is initialized to the first element of newList, which is 1.
The first element of newList is replaced by the last element of newList, which is 3.
The last element of newList is replaced by temp, which is 1.
The function returns the newList, which is [3,2,1].
<<<Output>>>
[3,2,1]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_list(list_1):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in list_1:
        sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_list([1,2,3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable list_1 is initialized to [1,2,3].
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the elements of list_1.
For each element i in list_1, it adds i to sum_1.
The loop finishes, and the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
