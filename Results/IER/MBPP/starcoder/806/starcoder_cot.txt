Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_run_uppercase(test_str):
  cnt = 0
  res = 0
  for idx in range(0, len(test_str)):
    if test_str[idx].isupper():
      cnt += 1
    else:
      res = cnt
      cnt = 0
  if test_str[len(test_str) - 1].isupper():
    res = cnt
  return (res)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `max_run_uppercase('GeMKSForGERksISBESt')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_str is initialized to 'GeMKSForGERksISBESt', which is a string.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of uppercase letters.
The variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum number of consecutive uppercase letters.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of test_str (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the characters in test_str.
For each character in test_str, it checks if it is an uppercase letter. If it is, it adds 1 to cnt.
Otherwise, it resets cnt to 0 and stores the current value of cnt in res.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the last character in test_str is an uppercase letter. If it is, it stores the current value of cnt in res.
The code returns the final value of res, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
