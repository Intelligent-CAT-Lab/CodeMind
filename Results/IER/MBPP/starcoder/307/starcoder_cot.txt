Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from copy import deepcopy
def colon_tuplex(tuplex,m,n):
  tuplex_colon = deepcopy(tuplex)
  tuplex_colon[m].append(n)
  return tuplex_colon
<Code>

What would be the return value of `colon_tuplex(("HELLO", 5, [], True),2,50)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable tuplex is initialized to ("HELLO", 5, [], True).
The variable m is initialized to 2.
The variable n is initialized to 50.
The variable tuplex_colon is initialized to a deep copy of tuplex.
The value of tuplex_colon is ("HELLO", 5, [], True).
The value of tuplex_colon[m] is ["HELLO", 5, [], True].
The value of tuplex_colon[m].append(n) is ["HELLO", 5, [], True, 50].
The code returns the value of tuplex_colon, which is ("HELLO", 5, [], True, 50).
<<<Output>>>
("HELLO", 5, [], True, 50)

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_digits(N):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_1 += int(i_str[j])
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_digits(20)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 20.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it converts i to a string and stores the length of the string in n.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider digits from 0 to n-1.
For each digit j in this range, it adds the digit to sum_1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 105.
<<<Output>>>
105
