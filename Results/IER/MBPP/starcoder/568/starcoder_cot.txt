Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def empty_list(length):
 empty_list = [{} for _ in range(length)]
 return empty_list
<Code>

What would be the return value of `empty_list(5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable length is initialized to 5.
The code creates an empty list and initializes it to be a list of 5 empty dictionaries.
The code returns the list.
<<<Output>>>
[{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_list(list_1):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in list_1:
        sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_list([1,2,3,4,5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable list_1 is initialized to be a list of integers [1,2,3,4,5].
The code initializes sum_1 to be 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the list_1.
For each element i in the list, it adds i to sum_1.
The code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
