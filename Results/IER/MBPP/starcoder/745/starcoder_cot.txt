Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):
    return [n for n in range(startnum, endnum+1) \
                if not any(map(lambda x: int(x) == 0 or n%int(x)!= 0, str(n)))]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `divisible_by_digits(1,22)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable startnum and endnum are initialized to 1 and 22, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from startnum to endnum (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 22.
For each number n in this range, it checks if any of the digits of n is 0 or if n is not divisible by any of the digits of n.
If any of the conditions is met, the current number n is not added to the list.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final list of numbers that meet the conditions, which is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]

    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_digits(12345)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 12345.
The code then calculates the sum of the digits of n, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
