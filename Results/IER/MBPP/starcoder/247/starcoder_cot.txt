Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

				L[i][j] = 2
			elif str[i] == str[j]: 
				L[i][j] = L[i+1][j-1] + 2
			else: 
				L[i][j] = max(L[i][j-1], L[i+1][j]); 
	return L[0][n-1]

What would be the return value of `lps("TENS FOR TENS")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized to "TENS FOR TENS".
The variable n is initialized to the length of str, which is 13.
The variable L is initialized to a 2-dimensional array with n rows and n columns.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 12.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from i to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from i to 12.
For each number j in this range, it checks if str[i] is equal to str[j].
If it is, it checks if cl is equal to 2.
If it is, it sets L[i][j] to 2.
If it is not, it checks if cl is equal to 2.
If it is, it sets L[i][j] to L[i+1][j-1] + 2.
If it is not, it checks if str[i] is equal to str[j].
If it is, it sets L[i][j] to L[i+1][j-1] + 2.
If it is not, it sets L[i][j] to max(L[i][j-1], L[i+1][j]).
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of L[0][n-1], which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
