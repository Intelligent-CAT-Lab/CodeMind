Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

	max_so_far = -2147483648
	max_ending_here = 0
	for i in range(n*k):

What would be the return value of `max_sub_array_sum_repeated([10, 20, -30, -1], 4, 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable n and variable k are initialized to [10, 20, -30, -1], 4 and 3, respectively.
variable max_so_far is initialized to -2147483648, which will be used to store the maximum sum of subarrays.
variable max_ending_here is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum sum of subarrays ending at the current index.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n*k (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 12.
For each number i in this range, it adds the current number to max_ending_here.
If max_so_far is less than max_ending_here, it updates max_so_far to max_ending_here.
If max_ending_here is less than 0, it resets max_ending_here to 0.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of max_so_far, which is 20.
<<<Output>>>
20
