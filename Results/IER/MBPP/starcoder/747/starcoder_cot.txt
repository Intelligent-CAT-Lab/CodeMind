Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:

  m = len(X)
  n = len(Y)
  o = len(Z)
  L = [[[0 for i in range(o+1)] for j in range(n+1)] for k in range(m+1)]
  for i in range(m+1): 
	  for j in range(n+1): 
		  for k in range(o+1): 
			  if (i == 0 or j == 0 or k == 0): 
				  L[i][j][k] = 0
			  elif (X[i-1] == Y[j-1] and X[i-1] == Z[k-1]): 
				  L[i][j][k] = L[i-1][j-1][k-1] + 1
			  else: 
				  L[i][j][k] = max(max(L[i-1][j][k], L[i][j-1][k]), L[i][j][k-1]) 
  return L[m][n][o]

What would be the return value of `lcs_of_three('AGGT12', '12TXAYB', '12XBA')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X, variable Y and variable Z are initialized to 'AGGT12', '12TXAYB' and '12XBA', respectively.
The variable m is initialized to the length of X, which is 6.
The variable n is initialized to the length of Y, which is 8.
The variable o is initialized to the length of Z, which is 6.
The variable L is initialized to a 3-dimensional array with 7 rows, 9 columns and 7 rows, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 8.
For each number j in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to o (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 6.
For each number k in this range, it checks if the following conditions are met:
i = 0 or j = 0 or k = 0
X[i-1] = Y[j-1] and X[i-1] = Z[k-1]
X[i-1] is the i-th character of X, Y[j-1] is the j-th character of Y and Z[k-1] is the k-th character of Z.
If all the conditions are met, the value of L[i][j][k] is set to L[i-1][j-1][k-1] + 1.
Otherwise, the value of L[i][j][k] is set to the maximum of the values of L[i-1][j][k], L[i][j-1][k] and L[i][j][k-1].
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of L[m][n][o], which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
