Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def geometric_sum(n):
  if n < 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return 1 / (pow(2, n)) + geometric_sum(n - 1)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `geometric_sum(7)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 7.
The code checks if n is less than 0. If it is, it returns 0.
If n is not less than 0, it returns 1 / (pow(2, n)) + geometric_sum(n - 1).
The function geometric_sum(n - 1) is called with n - 1 as the input.
The function geometric_sum(n - 1) returns 1 / (pow(2, n - 1)) + geometric_sum(n - 2).
The function geometric_sum(n - 2) is called with n - 2 as the input.
The function geometric_sum(n - 2) returns 1 / (pow(2, n - 2)) + geometric_sum(n - 3).
The function geometric_sum(n - 3) is called with n - 3 as the input.
The function geometric_sum(n - 3) returns 1 / (pow(2, n - 3)) + geometric_sum(n - 4).
The function geometric_sum(n - 4) is called with n - 4 as the input.
The function geometric_sum(n - 4) returns 1 / (pow(2, n - 4)) + geometric_sum(n - 5).
The function geometric_sum(n - 5) is called with n - 5 as the input.
The function geometric_sum(n - 5) returns 1 / (pow(2, n - 5)) + geometric_sum(n - 6).
The function geometric_sum(n - 6) is called with n - 6 as the input.
The function geometric_sum(n - 6) returns 1 / (pow(2, n - 6)) + geometric_sum(n - 7).
The function geometric_sum(n - 7) is called with n - 7 as the input.
The function geometric_sum(n - 7) returns 1 / (pow(2, n - 7)) + geometric_sum(n - 8).
