Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def reverse_vowels(str1):
	vowels = ""
	for char in str1:
		if char in "aeiouAEIOU":
			vowels += char
	result_string = ""
	for char in str1:
		if char in "aeiouAEIOU":
			result_string += vowels[-1]
			vowels = vowels[:-1]
		else:
			result_string += char
	return result_string
<Code>

What would be the return value of `reverse_vowels("Python")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable str1 is initialized to "Python".
The variable vowels is initialized to an empty string.
The variable result_string is initialized to an empty string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in str1.
For each character char in str1, it checks if char is in "aeiouAEIOU".
If it is, it adds char to vowels.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates over each character in str1.
For each character char in str1, it checks if char is in "aeiouAEIOU".
If it is, it adds the last character in vowels to result_string.
The code then removes the last character in vowels.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of result_string, which is "ythnohtP".
<<<Output>>>
ythnohtP

def sum_of_digits(N):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        sum_1 += sum_order
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_digits(20)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 20.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code adds sum_order to sum_1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 210.
<<<Output>>>
210
