Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sort_numeric_strings(nums_str):
    result = [int(x) for x in nums_str]
    result.sort()
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `sort_numeric_strings( ['4','12','45','7','0','100','200','-12','-500'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable nums_str is initialized to a list of strings, which is ['4','12','45','7','0','100','200','-12','-500'].
The code then creates a new list result, which is a list of integers, which is [4,12,45,7,0,100,200,-12,-500].
The code then sorts the list result in ascending order.
The code then returns the final value of result, which is [-500,-12,0,4,7,12,45,100,200].
<<<Output>>>
[-500,-12,0,4,7,12,45,100,200]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_squares(N):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_1 += i**2
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_squares(20)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 20.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it adds i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 2100.
<<<Output>>>
2100
