Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def cube_nums(nums):
 cube_nums = list(map(lambda x: x ** 3, nums))
 return cube_nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `cube_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable nums is initialized to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list nums.
For each number x in the list nums, it calculates the cube of x and stores it in cube_nums.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of cube_nums, which is [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list nums.
For each number x in the list nums, it calculates the square of x and adds it to sum_of_squares.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_of_squares, which is 385.
<<<Output>>>
