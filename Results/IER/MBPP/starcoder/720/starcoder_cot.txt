Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def add_dict_to_tuple(test_tup, test_dict):
  test_tup = list(test_tup)
  test_tup.append(test_dict)
  test_tup = tuple(test_tup)
  return (test_tup) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3} )`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_tup is initialized to (4, 5, 6), which is a tuple.
The variable test_dict is initialized to {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3}, which is a dictionary.
The code appends test_dict to test_tup, which results in (4, 5, 6, {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3}).
The code converts test_tup to a list, which results in [4, 5, 6, {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3}].
The code converts the list back to a tuple, which results in (4, 5, 6, {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3}).
The code returns the tuple (4, 5, 6, {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3}).
<<<Output>>>
(4, 5, 6, {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3})

<Code>
def sum_of_list(test_list):
  sum_1 = 0
  for i in test_list:
    sum_1 += i
  return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_list is initialized to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which is a list.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers in test_list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in test_list.
For each element i in test_list, it adds i to sum_1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value
