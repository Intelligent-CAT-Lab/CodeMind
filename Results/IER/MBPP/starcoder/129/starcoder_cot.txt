Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:

    iSize = len(my_matrix[0])
    sum_list = []
    sum_list.extend([sum (lines) for lines in my_matrix])   
    for col in range(iSize):

    result1 = 0
    for i in range(0,iSize):
        result1 +=my_matrix[i][i]
    sum_list.append(result1)      
    result2 = 0
    for i in range(iSize-1,-1,-1):
        result2 +=my_matrix[i][i]
    sum_list.append(result2)
    if len(set(sum_list))>1:
        return False
    return True

What would be the return value of `magic_square_test([[7, 12, 1, 14], [2, 13, 8, 11], [16, 3, 10, 5], [9, 6, 15, 4]])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable my_matrix is initialized to [[7, 12, 1, 14], [2, 13, 8, 11], [16, 3, 10, 5], [9, 6, 15, 4]].
The variable iSize is initialized to the length of the first row of my_matrix, which is 4.
The variable sum_list is initialized to an empty list.
The code then appends the sum of each row to sum_list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to iSize (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number col in this range, it appends the sum of the value of the col-th element in each row to sum_list.
The code then appends the sum of the value of the i-th element in each row to sum_list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to iSize (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it adds the value of the i-th element in the i-th row to result1.
The code then appends result1 to sum_list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from iSize-1 to -1 (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 0.
For each number i in this range, it adds the value of the i-th element in the i-th row to result2.
The code then appends result2 to sum_list.
The code then checks if the length of the set of sum_list is greater than 1.
The code then returns the final value of the function, which is True.
<<<Output>>>
True
