Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_sum(arr): 
	MSIBS = arr[:] 
	for i in range(len(arr)): 
		for j in range(0, i): 
			if arr[i] > arr[j] and MSIBS[i] < MSIBS[j] + arr[i]: 
				MSIBS[i] = MSIBS[j] + arr[i] 
	MSDBS = arr[:] 
	for i in range(1, len(arr) + 1): 
		for j in range(1, i): 
			if arr[-i] > arr[-j] and MSDBS[-i] < MSDBS[-j] + arr[-i]: 
				MSDBS[-i] = MSDBS[-j] + arr[-i] 
	max_sum = float("-Inf") 
	for i, j, k in zip(MSIBS, MSDBS, arr): 
		max_sum = max(max_sum, i + j - k) 
	return max_sum
<Code>

What would be the return value of `max_sum([1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(arr) - 1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 8.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to i - 1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to i - 1.
For each number j in this range, it checks if arr[i] > arr[j] and MSIBS[i] < MSIBS[j] + arr[i]. If it is, it updates MSIBS[i] to MSIBS[j] + arr[i].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to len(arr) + 1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 9.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to i - 1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to i - 1.
For each number j in this range, it checks if arr[-i] > arr[-j] and MSDBS[-i] < MSDBS[-j] + arr[-i]. If it is, it updates MSDBS[-i] to MSDBS[-j] + arr[-i].
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the three lists MSIBS, MSDBS and arr, and checks if i + j - k is greater than max_sum. If it is, it updates max_sum to i + j - k.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of max_sum, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
