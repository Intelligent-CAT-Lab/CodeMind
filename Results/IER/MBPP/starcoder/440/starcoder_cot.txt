Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
 for m in re.finditer(r"\w+ly", text):
    return (m.start(), m.end(), m.group(0))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `find_adverb_position("clearly!! we can see the sky")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the re module.
The code then defines a function find_adverb_position that takes a string as input.
The code then uses a regular expression to find all words ending with "ly".
The code then returns the start position, end position and the word itself.
<<<Output>>>
(10, 13, 'clearly')

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_all_vowels(text):
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
    vowel_list = []
    for i in text:
        if i in vowels:
            vowel_list.append(i)
    return vowel_list
</Code>
What would be the return value of `find_all_vowels("hello")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a list vowels containing the letters a, e, i, o and u.
The code then defines a list vowel_list that will be used to store the vowels found in the text.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the text.
For each letter i in the text, the code checks if i is in vowels. If it is, it appends i to vowel_list.
The code then returns the final value of vowel_list, which is ['e', 'o'].
<<<Output>>>
['e', 'o']
