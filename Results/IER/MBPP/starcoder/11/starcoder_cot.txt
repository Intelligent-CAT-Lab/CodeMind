Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def remove_Occ(s,ch): 
    for i in range(len(s)): 
        if (s[i] == ch): 
            s = s[0 : i] + s[i + 1:] 
            break
    for i in range(len(s) - 1,-1,-1):  
        if (s[i] == ch): 
            s = s[0 : i] + s[i + 1:] 
            break
    return s 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `remove_Occ("hello","l")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to "hello", and variable ch is initialized to "l".
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of s (inclusive), which is 5.
For each index i in this range, it checks if s[i] is equal to ch. If it is, it removes the character at index i from s.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from the length of s (exclusive) to 0 (exclusive), which is 4.
For each index i in this range, it checks if s[i] is equal to ch. If it is, it removes the character at index i from s.
The code then returns the final value of s, which is "heo".
<<<Output>>>

What would be the return value of `sum_of_digits(20)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.
