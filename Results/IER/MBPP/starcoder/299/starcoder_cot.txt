Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from collections import defaultdict
def max_aggregate(stdata):
    temp = defaultdict(int)
    for name, marks in stdata:
        temp[name] += marks
    return max(temp.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
<Code>

What would be the return value of `max_aggregate([('Juan Whelan',90),('Sabah Colley',88),('Peter Nichols',7),('Juan Whelan',122),('Sabah Colley',84)])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable stdata is initialized to a list of tuples, which is [('Juan Whelan',90),('Sabah Colley',88),('Peter Nichols',7),('Juan Whelan',122),('Sabah Colley',84)].
The code then initializes a temporary variable temp to a defaultdict with default value 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list of tuples stdata.
For each tuple in the list, it adds the marks to the name in the temporary variable temp.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the maximum value of the temporary variable temp, which is ('Juan Whelan',122).
<<<Output>>>
('Juan Whelan',122)

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_digits(N):
    sum_1 = 0
    while N > 0:
        sum_1 += N % 10
        N = N // 10
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_digits(123456789)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 123456789.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates while N is greater than 0.
The code adds the last digit of N to sum_1.
The code then divides N by 10 to get the next digit.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 45.
<<<Output>>>
45
