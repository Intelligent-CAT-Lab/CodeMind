Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_even_and_even_index(arr):  
    i = 0
    sum = 0
    for i in range(0, len(arr),2): 
        if (arr[i] % 2 == 0) : 
            sum += arr[i]  
    return sum

What would be the return value of `sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8].
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The variable sum is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of arr (6), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the number is even. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum. The condition is met when i is 0,2,4.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_odd_numbers(N):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        if i % 2!= 0:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_odd_numbers(20)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 20.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the number is odd. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 20.
<<<Output>>>
