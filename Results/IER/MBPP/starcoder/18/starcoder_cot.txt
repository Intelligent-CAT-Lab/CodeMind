Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

What would be the return value of `remove_dirty_chars("probasscurve", "pros")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable NO_OF_CHARS is initialized to 256.
The function str_to_list(string) takes a string as input and returns a list of characters.
The function lst_to_string(List) takes a list of characters as input and returns a string.
The function get_char_count_array(string) takes a string as input and returns a list of integers.
The function remove_dirty_chars(string, second_string) takes two strings as input and returns a string.
The function str_to_list(string) is called to convert the string "probasscurve" to a list of characters.
The function get_char_count_array(string) is called to convert the string "pros" to a list of integers.
The list of integers is used to initialize a list of integers with 256 elements.
The list of integers is used to count the number of occurrences of each character in the second string.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the list of characters.
The code checks if the character at the current index of the list of characters is in the second string.
If it is, the character is added to the list of characters.
The code then increments the index of the list of characters.
The code then increments the index of the list of characters.
The code then returns the list of characters as a string.

What would be the return value of `find_max(1, 2, 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function find_max(a, b, c) takes three integers as input and returns an integer.
The variable max_1 is initialized to a.
The code checks if b is greater than max_1. If
