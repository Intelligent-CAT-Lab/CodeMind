Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def drop_empty(dict1):
  dict1 = {key:value for (key, value) in dict1.items() if value is not None}
  return dict1
<Code>

What would be the return value of `drop_empty({'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green', 'c3':None})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable dict1 is initialized to {'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green', 'c3':None}.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the dictionary.
For each key, value pair in the dictionary, it checks if the value is None.
If the value is not None, it adds the key, value pair to a new dictionary.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of the new dictionary, which is {'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}.
<<<Output>>>
{'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_list(list1):
  sum1 = 0
  for i in list1:
    sum1 += i
  return sum1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable list1 is initialized to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The variable sum1 is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the list.
For each element in the list, it adds the element to sum1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum1, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
