Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def add_nested_tuples(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(tuple(a + b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
   for tup1, tup2 in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))
  return (res) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `add_nested_tuples(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3)))`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_tup1 is initialized to ((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)).
The variable test_tup2 is initialized to ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3)).
The variable res is initialized to an empty tuple.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the tuples in test_tup1 and test_tup2.
For each tuple, it creates a new tuple by adding the corresponding elements in the two tuples.
The code then returns the final value of res, which is ((7, 10), (7, 14), (3, 10), (8, 11)).
<<<Output>>>
((7, 10), (7, 14), (3, 10), (8, 11))
