Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_ludic(n):
	ludics = []
	for i in range(1, n + 1):
		ludics.append(i)
	index = 1
	while(index!= len(ludics)):
		first_ludic = ludics[index]
		remove_index = index + first_ludic
		while(remove_index < len(ludics)):
			ludics.remove(ludics[remove_index])
			remove_index = remove_index + first_ludic - 1
		index += 1
	return ludics
<Code>

What would be the return value of `get_ludic(10)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it appends i to the list ludics.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until index equals the length of ludics.
Inside the while loop, the code assigns the value of the first element of ludics to the variable first_ludic.
The code then assigns the value of index plus first_ludic to the variable remove_index.
The code enters a while loop that iterates until remove_index is greater than or equal to the length of ludics.
Inside the while loop, the code removes the element of ludics at the index remove_index.
The code then assigns the value of remove_index plus first_ludic minus 1 to remove_index.
The code then increments index by 1.
After the while loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ludics, which is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
