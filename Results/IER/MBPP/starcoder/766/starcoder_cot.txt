Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def pair_wise(l1):
    temp = []
    for i in range(len(l1) - 1):
        current_element, next_element = l1[i], l1[i + 1]
        x = (current_element, next_element)
        temp.append(x)
    return temp
<Code>

What would be the return value of `pair_wise([1,1,2,3,3,4,4,5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable l1 is initialized to [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,5].
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(l1) - 1, which is 7.
For each iteration, it assigns the current element to current_element and the next element to next_element.
It then creates a tuple x with the current element and the next element.
It appends x to the list temp.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of temp, which is [(1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)].
<<<Output>>>
[(1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)]

    for i in l1:
        sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

What would be the return value of `sum_of_list([1,2,3,4,5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.

The variable l1 is initialized to [1,2,3,4,5].
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(l1) - 1, which is 4.
For each iteration, it adds the current element to sum_1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 15.
