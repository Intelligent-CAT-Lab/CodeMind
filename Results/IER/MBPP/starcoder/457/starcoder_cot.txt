Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def Find_Min(lst): 
    return min(lst, key=len) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable lst is initialized to [[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]].
The code then calls the function min() with the argument lst.
The function min() returns the minimum value in the list lst.
The function min() also takes an optional argument key, which is a function that takes a single argument and returns a key to use for sorting purposes.
The default value of key is None, which means that the list elements themselves will be used for sorting.
The function min() then returns the minimum value in the list lst, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def Find_Max(lst): 
    return max(lst, key=len) 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `Find_Max([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable lst is initialized to [[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]].
The code then calls the function max() with the argument lst.
The function max() returns the maximum value in the list lst.
The function max() also takes an optional argument key, which is a function that takes a single argument and returns a key to use for sorting purposes.
The default value of key is None, which means that the list elements themselves will be used for sorting.
The function max() then returns the maximum value in the list lst, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
