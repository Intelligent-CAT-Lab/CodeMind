Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

What would be the return value of `find_kth([2, 3, 6, 7, 9], [1, 4, 8, 10], 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr1 is initialized to [2, 3, 6, 7, 9], and the variable arr2 is initialized to [1, 4, 8, 10].
The variable k is initialized to 5.
The variable m is initialized to the length of arr1, which is 5.
The variable n is initialized to the length of arr2, which is 4.
The variable sorted1 is initialized to an array of length m + n, which is 9.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The variable j is initialized to 0.
The variable d is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than m and j is less than n.
The code checks if arr1[i] is less than arr2[j]. If it is, it adds arr1[i] to sorted1.
If it is not, it adds arr2[j] to sorted1.
The code increments d by 1.
The code increments i by 1.
The code increments j by 1.
The code exits the while loop.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than m.
The code adds arr1[i] to sorted1.
The code increments d by 1.
The code increments i by 1.
The code exits the while loop.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while j is less than n.
The code adds arr2[j] to sorted1.
The code increments d by 1.
The code increments j by 1.
The code exits the while loop.
The code returns sorted1[k - 1], which is 7.
