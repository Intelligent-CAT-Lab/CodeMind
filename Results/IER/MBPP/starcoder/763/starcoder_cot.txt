Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_min_diff(arr,n): 
    arr = sorted(arr) 
    diff = 10**20 
    for i in range(n-1): 
        if arr[i+1] - arr[i] < diff: 
            diff = arr[i+1] - arr[i]  
    return diff 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `find_min_diff((1,5,3,19,18,25),6)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to (1,5,3,19,18,25), and variable n is initialized to 6.
The code sorts the array arr in ascending order.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the difference between the next number and the current number.
The code checks if the difference is smaller than the current smallest difference. If it is, it updates the current smallest difference to the new difference.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of the smallest difference, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

Consider the following code:

def find_max_diff(arr,n): 
    arr = sorted(arr) 
    diff = 0 
    for i in range(n-1): 
        if arr[i+1] - arr[i] > diff: 
            diff = arr[i+1] - arr[i]  
    return diff 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `find_max_diff((1,5,3,19,18,25),6)`?
