Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

  while count < n + 1:

      break
    elif j == n:
      m1 = m2
      m2 = arr1[0]
      break
    if arr1[i] <= arr2[j]:
      m1 = m2
      m2 = arr1[i]
      i += 1
    else:
      m1 = m2
      m2 = arr2[j]
      j += 1
  return (m1 + m2)/2

What would be the return value of `get_median([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr1, arr2 and n are initialized to [1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45] and 5, respectively.
variable i is initialized to 0, variable j is initialized to 0, variable m1 is initialized to -1, variable m2 is initialized to -1, variable count is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates until count is greater than or equal to n + 1.
The code enters a if statement that checks if i is equal to n. If it is, it sets m1 to m2 and m2 to arr2[0], which is 2.
The code enters another if statement that checks if j is equal to n. If it is, it sets m1 to m2 and m2 to arr1[0], which is 1.
The code enters another if statement that checks if arr1[i] is less than or equal to arr2[j]. If it is, it sets m1 to m2 and m2 to arr1[i], which is 12.
The code enters another else statement that checks if arr1[i] is greater than arr2[j]. If it is, it sets m1 to m2 and m2 to arr2[j], which is 13.
The code exits the while loop and returns the final value of m2, which is 13.
