Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>

What would be the return value of `check_min_heap([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function check_min_heap_helper takes in an array arr and an index i.
The function checks if the left child of i is less than or equal to the parent of i.
If the left child is less than or equal to the parent, it calls itself recursively with the left child as the new index.
The function also checks if the right child of i is less than or equal to the parent of i.
If the right child is less than or equal to the parent, it calls itself recursively with the right child as the new index.
The function returns True if both the left and right child conditions are met.
The function returns False otherwise.
The function check_min_heap takes in an array arr.
The function calls check_min_heap_helper with the index 0.
The function returns the return value of check_min_heap_helper.
<<<Output>>>
True

What would be the return value of `find_max_subarray([-1, 2, 3, -4, 5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function find_max_subarray takes in an array arr.
The variable max_sum is initialized to 0.
The variable current_sum is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of arr (exclusive).
For each index i in this range, it adds arr[i] to current_sum.
If current_sum is less than 0, it resets current_sum to 0.
If current_sum is greater than max_sum, it updates max_sum to current_sum.
The code returns the final value of max_sum, which is
