Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_undulating(n): 
	n = str(n)
	if (len(n) <= 2): 
		return False
	for i in range(2, len(n)): 
		if (n[i - 2]!= n[i]): 
			return False
	return True
<Code>

What would be the return value of `is_undulating(1212121)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 1212121.
The code checks if the length of n is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it returns False.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the length of n.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the number at index i - 2 is equal to the number at index i. If it is not, it returns False.
After the loop finishes, the code returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_palindrome(n): 
	n = str(n)
	if (len(n) <= 1): 
		return True
	if (n[0]!= n[-1]): 
		return False
	return is_palindrome(n[1:-1])
<Code>

What would be the return value of `is_palindrome(1212121)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 1212121.
The code checks if the length of n is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it returns True.
The code then checks if the number at index 0 is equal to the number at index -1. If it is not, it returns False.
The code then calls itself recursively with the input n[1:-1].
After the recursive call, the code returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
