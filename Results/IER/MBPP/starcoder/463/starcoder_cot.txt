Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

Consider the following code:

		elif arr[i] == 0:
			max_ending_here = 1
			min_ending_here = 1
		else:
			temp = max_ending_here
			max_ending_here = max (min_ending_here * arr[i], 1)
			min_ending_here = temp * arr[i]
		if (max_so_far < max_ending_here):
			max_so_far = max_ending_here
	if flag == 0 and max_so_far == 0:
		return 0
	return max_so_far

What would be the return value of `max_subarray_product([1, -2, -3, 0, 7, -8, -2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [1, -2, -3, 0, 7, -8, -2].
The variable n is initialized to 7.
The variable max_ending_here is initialized to 1.
The variable min_ending_here is initialized to 1.
The variable max_so_far is initialized to 0.
The variable flag is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it checks if arr[i] is greater than 0. If it is, it calculates the product of max_ending_here and arr[i] and stores it in max_ending_here. It also calculates the product of min_ending_here and arr[i] and stores it in min_ending_here. The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3,4,5.
If arr[i] is equal to 0, it resets max_ending_here and min_ending_here to 1. The condition is met when i is 6.
If arr[i] is less than 0, it calculates the product of max_ending_here and arr[i] and stores it in temp. It also calculates the product of min_ending_here and arr[i] and stores it in max_ending_here. It also calculates the product of temp and arr[i] and stores it in min_ending_here. The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3,4,5.
If max_so_far is less than max_ending_here, it resets max_so_far to max_ending_here. The condition is met when i is 6.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if flag is equal to 0 and if max_so_far is equal to 0. If both conditions are met, it returns 0.
If flag is not equal to 0 or max_so_far is not equal to 0, it returns max_so_far.
