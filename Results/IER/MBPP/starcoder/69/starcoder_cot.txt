Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

What would be the return value of `is_sublist([2,4,3,5,7],[3,7])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable l is initialized to [2,4,3,5,7], and variable s is initialized to [3,7].
The code first checks if s is equal to l. If it is, the function returns True.
Next, the code checks if s is empty. If it is, the function returns True.
Next, the code checks if s is equal to l. If it is, the function returns True.
Next, the code checks if the length of s is greater than the length of l. If it is, the function returns False.
Next, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of l minus the length of s (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if the first element of s is equal to the first element of l plus the current iteration.
If it is, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to the length of s minus 1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if the element of s plus the current iteration is equal to the element of l plus the current iteration.
If it is, the code returns True.
If the loop finishes without returning True, the code returns False.
<<<Output>>>
True
