Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def check_K(test_tup, K):
  res = False
  for ele in test_tup:
    if ele == K:
      res = True
      break
  return res 
<Code>

What would be the return value of `check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test_tup is initialized to (10, 4, 5, 6, 8), which is a tuple.
The variable K is initialized to 6.
The variable res is initialized to False.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each element in test_tup.
For each element ele in test_tup, it checks if ele is equal to K.
If it is, it sets res to True and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of res, which is True.
<<<Output>>>
True
