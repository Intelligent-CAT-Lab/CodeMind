Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sequential_search(dlist, item):
    pos = 0
    found = False
    while pos < len(dlist) and not found:
        if dlist[pos] == item:
            found = True
        else:
            pos = pos + 1
    return found, pos
<Code>

What would be the return value of `sequential_search([11,23,58,31,56,77,43,12,65,19],31)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable dlist is initialized to [11,23,58,31,56,77,43,12,65,19], which is the list of numbers to be searched.
The variable item is initialized to 31, which is the number to be searched.
The variable pos is initialized to 0, which is the position of the current element in the list.
The variable found is initialized to False, which is the flag to indicate whether the number has been found.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the list (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the elements in the list.
The code checks if the current element is equal to the number to be searched. If it is, it sets the flag found to True.
If the current element is not equal to the number to be searched, it increments the value of pos by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of found and pos, which is True and 3.
<<<Output>>>
True, 3

    while first <= last and not found:
        mid = (first + last) // 2

        else:
            if item < dlist[mid]:
                last = mid - 1
            else:
                first = mid + 1
    return found, mid
