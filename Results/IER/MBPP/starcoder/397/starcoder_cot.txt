Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def median_numbers(a,b,c):
 if a > b:
    if a < c:
        median = a
    elif b > c:
        median = b
    else:
        median = c
 else:
    if a > c:
        median = a
    elif b < c:
        median = b
    else:
        median = c
 return median
<Code>

What would be the return value of `median_numbers(25,55,65)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 25, 55 and 65, respectively.
The code checks if a is greater than b.
If a is greater than b, it checks if a is less than c.
If a is less than c, it assigns the value of a to the variable median.
If a is not less than c, it checks if b is greater than c.
If b is greater than c, it assigns the value of b to the variable median.
If b is not greater than c, it assigns the value of c to the variable median.
After the code finishes, it returns the value of the variable median, which is 55.
<<<Output>>>
55

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_digits(N):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_1 += int(i_str[j])
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_digits(20)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 20.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it converts i to a string and stores it in i_str.
It also calculates the length of i_str and stores it in n.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider digits from 0 to n-1.
For each digit j in this range, it adds the current digit to sum_1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
