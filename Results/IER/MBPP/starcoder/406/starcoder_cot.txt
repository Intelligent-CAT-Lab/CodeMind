Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_Parity(x): 
    y = x ^ (x >> 1); 
    y = y ^ (y >> 2); 
    y = y ^ (y >> 4); 
    y = y ^ (y >> 8); 
    y = y ^ (y >> 16); 
    if (y & 1): 
        return True
    return False

What would be the return value of `find_Parity(12)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 12.
The variable y is initialized to x.
The code then performs a bitwise XOR operation on x and y, which is equivalent to x XOR y.
The code then performs a bitwise XOR operation on y and y, which is equivalent to y XOR y.
The code then performs a bitwise XOR operation on y and y, which is equivalent to y XOR y.
The code then performs a bitwise XOR operation on y and y, which is equivalent to y XOR y.
The code then performs a bitwise XOR operation on y and y, which is equivalent to y XOR y.
The code then performs a bitwise AND operation on y and 1, which is equivalent to y AND 1.
The code then returns the final value of y, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
