Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def maxAverageOfPath(cost):
  N = len(cost)
  dp = [[0 for i in range(N + 1)] for j in range(N + 1)]
  dp[0][0] = cost[0][0]
  for i in range(1, N):
    dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + cost[i][0]
  for j in range(1, N):
    dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + cost[0][j]
  for i in range(1, N):
    for j in range(1, N):
      dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j],
                     dp[i][j - 1]) + cost[i][j]
  return dp[N - 1][N - 1] / (2 * N - 1)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable cost is initialized to [[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]].
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The variable dp is initialized to a 2-dimensional array with N + 1 rows and N + 1 columns.
The first row and the first column of dp are initialized to 0.
The first row of dp is initialized to the first row of cost.
The first column of dp is initialized to the first column of cost.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it adds the value of the previous row of dp to the first element of the current row of dp.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it adds the value of the first element of the previous column of dp to the first element of the current column of dp.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the maximum value of the previous element of the current row of dp and the previous element of the current column of dp, adds the value of the current element of cost to the sum, and stores the sum in the current element of dp.
The code then returns the final value of the last element of the last row of dp divided by 2N - 1, which is 10 / 6 = 1.6666666666666667.
<<<Output>>>
1.6666666666666667
