Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def large_product(nums1, nums2, N):
    result = sorted([x*y for x in nums1 for y in nums2], reverse=True)[:N]
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `large_product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],[3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 6],3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable nums1 is initialized to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], which is a list of integers.
The variable nums2 is initialized to [3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 6], which is a list of integers.
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code generates a list of all possible products of the two lists, which is [3, 6, 12, 18, 20, 12, 18, 24, 30, 24, 36, 42, 36, 48, 54, 48, 60, 66, 60, 72, 78, 72, 84, 90, 84, 96, 102, 96, 108, 114, 108, 120, 126, 120, 132, 138, 132, 144, 150, 144, 156, 162, 156, 168, 174, 168, 180, 186, 180, 192, 198, 192, 204, 210, 204, 216, 222, 216, 228, 234, 228, 240, 246, 240, 252, 258, 252, 264, 270, 264, 276, 282, 276, 288, 294, 288, 300, 306, 300, 312, 318, 312, 324, 330, 324, 336, 342,
