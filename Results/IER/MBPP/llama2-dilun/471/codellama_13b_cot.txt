<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: an array arr and an integer n.
The function first initializes a variable mul to 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the array arr.
For each element arr[i], it calculates the remainder of arr[i] divided by n using the modulo operator (%).
It then multiplies the current value of mul by the result of this calculation and stores it in mul.
The loop continues until all elements of the array have been processed.
Finally, the function returns the remainder of mul divided by n using the modulo operator.

Based on this analysis, we can determine that the return value of the function will be the remainder of the product of the elements of the array arr divided by n, when the product is divided by n.
