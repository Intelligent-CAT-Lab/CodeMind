The code defines a function called median_trapezium that takes three arguments: base1, base2, and height.
The function calculates the median of the trapezium with the given base1, base2, and height.
The median is calculated by taking the average of the two bases and multiplying it by 0.5.
The function then returns the median.

In this case, the input values are base1 = 15, base2 = 25, and height = 35.
The median of the trapezium is calculated as follows:
median = 0.5 * (15 + 25) = 0.5 * 40 = 20

Therefore, the return value of the code is 20.

The code defines a function called greet that takes one argument: name.
The function returns a string that says "Hello, " followed by the name, and ends with an exclamation mark.
The function is then called with the argument "Alice".
The print statement prints the return value of the function, which is "Hello, Alice!".

Therefore, the output of the code is "Hello, Alice!".
<<<Output>>>
Hello, Alice!
