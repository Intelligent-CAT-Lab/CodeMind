<<<Analysis>>>
The function min_Swaps takes two strings as input, str1 and str2.
The function first calculates the number of positions where the two strings differ, which is 2 in this case.
The function then checks if this number is even or odd.
If it is even, it returns the number divided by 2, which is 1 in this case.
If it is odd, it returns the string "Not Possible".

[INST: What would be the return value of `min_Swaps("1101","1110")`?]  The return value of `min_Swaps("1101","1110")` would be 1.

Explanation:
The function first calculates the number of positions where the two strings differ, which is 2 in this case.
The function then checks if this number is even or odd.
Since the number is even, the function returns the number divided by 2, which is 1 in this case.
Therefore, the return value of `min_Swaps("1101","1110")` is 1.
