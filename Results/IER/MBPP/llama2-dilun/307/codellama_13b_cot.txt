<<<Analysis>>>
The function colon_tuplex takes in a tuple, m, and n as input.
The function first makes a deep copy of the input tuple using the deepcopy function from the copy module.
The function then appends the value of n to the mth index of the copied tuple.
The function then returns the modified tuple.

In this case, the input tuple is ("HELLO", 5, [], True) and the values of m and n are 2 and 50, respectively.
The function will append 50 to the 2nd index of the copied tuple, which is the empty list at index 2.
The modified tuple will be ("HELLO", 5, [50], True).

<<<Output>>>
("HELLO", 5, [50], True)
