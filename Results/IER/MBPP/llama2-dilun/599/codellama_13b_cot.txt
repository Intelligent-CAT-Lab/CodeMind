The variable number is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to number (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number value in this range, it adds value to total.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the average by dividing total by number.
The code then returns a tuple containing the total and the average.
