The function takes a list of tuples as input.
The code first calculates the absolute value of the product of each tuple element and stores it in a list.
The code then finds the maximum value in this list and returns it.

In this case, the list of tuples is [(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)].
The product of each tuple element is calculated as follows:

* (2, 7) -> 14
* (2, 6) -> 12
* (1, 8) -> 8
* (4, 9) -> 36

The absolute value of each product is calculated as follows:

* 14 -> 14
* 12 -> 12
* 8 -> 8
* 36 -> 36

The maximum value in this list is 36, which is the return value of the function.

The function greet takes a string as input and returns a string.
The code concatenates the string "Hello, " with the input string and the string "!".
The code then prints the return value of the function.

In this case, the input string is "Alice".
The return value of the function is "Hello, Alice!".
<<<Output>>>
Hello, Alice!
