The function takes two arguments: list1 and L.
list1 is a list of integers, and L is an integer that represents the index of the element to be removed.
The function returns a new list that is a copy of list1, but with the element at index L removed.

The code first creates a new list that is a copy of list1, using slicing.
The slice [:L-1] selects all elements up to (but not including) the element at index L-1.
The slice [L:] selects all elements starting from the element at index L.
The two slices are then concatenated using the + operator, which creates a new list that contains all elements from list1 except for the element at index L.

The return value of the function is the new list that was created.

The function greet takes a single argument, name, which is a string.
The function returns a string that is the concatenation of "Hello, " and name, followed by an exclamation mark.

The code first defines a function called greet that takes a single argument, name.
The function returns a string that is the concatenation of "Hello, " and name, followed by an exclamation mark.

The code then calls the greet function with the argument "Alice".
The function returns the string "Hello, Alice!".

The code then prints the return value of the greet function, which is "Hello
