The function count_rotation takes an array arr as input.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of the array (exclusive).
For each index i in this range, the code checks if the element at index i is less than the element at index i-1.
If this condition is met, the function returns the value of i.
If the loop finishes without returning, the function returns 0.

In this case, the array [3,2,1] is passed as input.
The loop iterates from 1 to 2 (exclusive), and the condition is met when i is 2.
The function returns 2.
