<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The function is_polite takes an integer n as input.
The first line of the function increments n by 1.
The second line calculates the logarithm of n to the base 2 and adds it to n.
The third line casts the result to an integer.
The function returns the result of the last line.

The code will return the value of the last line, which is the result of the integer cast of the expression n + (math.log(n + math.log(n, 2), 2)).
