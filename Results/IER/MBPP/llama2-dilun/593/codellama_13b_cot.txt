The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression functionality.
The function removezero_ip takes an IP address as input and returns a modified IP address with any leading zeros removed.
The code uses the re.sub function to replace any occurrence of a dot followed by zero or more zeros with a dot.
The function then returns the modified IP address.
