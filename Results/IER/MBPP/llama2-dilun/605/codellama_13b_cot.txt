The function prime_num takes an integer argument num.
The function first checks if num is greater than or equal to 1. If it is, it enters a loop that iterates from 2 to num//2.
For each number i in this range, it checks if num is divisible by i. If it is, it returns False.
If num is not divisible by any number in this range, it returns True.
The function also has an else clause that returns False if num is less than 1.

[INST: What would be the return value of `prime_num(13)`?]  The return value of `prime_num(13)` would be `True`.

Explanation:
The function `prime_num` takes an integer argument `num`.
The function first checks if `num` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `num` is 13, which is greater than 1, the function enters the loop that iterates from 2 to `num//2`, which is 13//2 = 6.
The loop checks if `num` is divisible by any number in the range [2, 6]. Since 13 is not divisible by any number in this range, the function returns `True`.
Therefore, the return value of `prime_num(13)` is `True`.

[INST: What would be the return value of `prime_num(12)`?]  The return value of `prime_num(12)` would be `False`.

Explanation:
The function `prime_num` takes an integer argument `num`.
The function first checks if `num` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `num` is 12, which is greater than 1, the function enters the loop that iterates from 2 to `num//2`, which is 12//2 = 6.
The loop checks if `num` is divisible by any number in the range [2, 6]. Since 12 is divisible by 2, the function returns `False`.
Therefore, the return value of `prime_num(12)` is `False`.
