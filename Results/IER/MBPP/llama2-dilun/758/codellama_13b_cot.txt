The function takes a list of lists as input.
The function first initializes an empty dictionary called result.
The function then iterates over the input list and for each sublist l, it creates a tuple of the sublist and appends 1 to the dictionary value associated with the tuple.
If the tuple is not present in the dictionary, it is added with a value of 1.
The function then iterates over the dictionary and for each key-value pair, it replaces the value with the sum of the values in the list.
The function returns the final dictionary.

The input list is [[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [13, 15, 17], [5, 7], [9, 11]].
The function processes the input as follows:

* The first sublist [1, 3] is processed and the tuple (1, 3) is added to the dictionary with a value of 1.
* The second sublist [5, 7] is processed and the tuple (5, 7) is added to the dictionary with a value of 1.
* The third sublist [1, 3] is processed and the tuple (1, 3) is already present in the dictionary, so the value is updated to 2.
* The fourth sublist [13, 15, 17] is processed and the tuple (13, 15, 17) is added to the dictionary with a value of 1.
* The fifth sublist [5, 7] is processed and the tuple (5, 7) is already present in the dictionary, so the value is updated to 2.
* The sixth sublist [9, 11] is processed and the tuple (9, 11) is added to the dictionary with a value of 1.

The final dictionary is {(1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1, (9, 11): 1}.
<<<Output>>>
{ (1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1
