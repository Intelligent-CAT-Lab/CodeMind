[INST: What would be the return value of `swap_numbers(10,20)`?]  The return value of `swap_numbers(10,20)` would be `(20, 10)`.

Explanation:

The function `swap_numbers` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and swaps their values. The function first assigns the value of `a` to a temporary variable `temp`. Then it assigns the value of `b` to `a`. Finally, it assigns the value of `temp` to `b`. The function returns the swapped values of `a` and `b`.

In this case, the function is called with `swap_numbers(10, 20)`, which means that `a` is 10 and `b` is 20. The function swaps the values of `a` and `b`, so the return value is `(20, 10)`.

Therefore, the return value of `swap_numbers(10, 20)` is `(20, 10)`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
