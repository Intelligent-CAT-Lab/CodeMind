The variable n is initialized to 5, which means the code will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number num in this range, it checks if num is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it skips to the next iteration of the loop.
For each number num in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 2 to num (exclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if num is divisible by i. If it is, it breaks out of the inner loop and continues to the next iteration of the outer loop.
If the inner loop completes without breaking, it means that num is a prime number. The code then increments the variable ctr by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ctr, which is 2.

What is the output of the following code?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The variable name is initialized to "Alice", which means the code will consider the string "Alice".
The code enters a function called greet, which takes a string as input.
The function returns the string "Hello, " concatenated with the input string, followed by an exclamation mark.
The code then prints the return value of the function, which is "Hello, Alice!".
<<<Output>>>
Hello, Alice!
