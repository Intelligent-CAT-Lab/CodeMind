The function test_duplicate takes an arraynums as input.
The function first converts the arraynums to a set using the set() function.
The function then checks if the length of the original arraynums is not equal to the length of the set.
If the length of the original arraynums is not equal to the length of the set, it means that there are duplicates in the arraynums.
The function returns True if there are duplicates, and False otherwise.
