<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the cmath module, which provides mathematical functions for complex numbers.
The function convert takes a single argument, numbers, which is a complex number.
The function first converts the complex number to polar form using the cmath.polar function.
The polar form of a complex number is a tuple containing the magnitude and phase of the number.
The function then returns the polar form of the complex number.

In this case, the input to the function is 1, which is a real number.
The function will convert the real number to a complex number with a magnitude of 1 and a phase of 0.
The polar form of this complex number is (1, 0).

Therefore, the return value of the function is (1, 0).
<<<Output>>>
(1, 0)
