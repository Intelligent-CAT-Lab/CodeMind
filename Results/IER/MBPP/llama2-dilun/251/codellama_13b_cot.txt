<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: a list and an element.
The function creates a new list by iterating over the original list and inserting the element between each element of the original list.
The function then returns the new list.

In this case, the function is called with the argument `['Red', 'Green', 'Black']` and the element `'c'`.
The function will iterate over the original list and insert the element `'c'` between each element, resulting in the new list `['Red', 'c', 'Green', 'c', 'Black']`.
<<<Output>>>
['Red', 'c', 'Green', 'c', 'Black']
