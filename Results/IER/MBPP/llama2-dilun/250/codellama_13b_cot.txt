The variable tup is initialized to (10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), which is a tuple of integers.
The variable x is initialized to 4, which is an integer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the tuple tup.
For each element ele in tup, it checks if ele is equal to x. If it is, it increments the variable count by 1.
The loop finishes and the code returns the final value of count, which is 2.
