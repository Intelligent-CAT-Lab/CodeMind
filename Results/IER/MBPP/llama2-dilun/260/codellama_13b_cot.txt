<<<Analysis>>>
The function newman_prime takes an integer n as input.
The function first checks if n is either 0 or 1, and if so, it returns 1.
If n is neither 0 nor 1, the function returns 2 times the result of calling newman_prime with n-1 as input, plus the result of calling newman_prime with n-2 as input.

The function will enter an infinite loop if n is not 0 or 1, because the function calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as input, which will always be less than n.

<<<Output>>>
The function will return 1 if n is 0 or 1, and will return 2 times the result of calling newman_prime with n-1 as input, plus the result of calling newman_prime with n-2 as input if n is neither 0 nor 1.

The return value of newman_prime(3) will be 2 times the result of calling newman_prime with 2 as input, plus the result of calling newman_prime with 1 as input.

The return value of newman_prime(2) will be 2 times the result of calling newman_prime with 1 as input, plus the result of calling newman_prime with 0 as input.

The return value of newman_prime(1) will be 2 times the result of calling newman_prime with 0 as input, plus the result of calling newman_prime with -1 as input.

The return value of newman_prime(0) will be 1.

The return value of newman_prime(-1) will be 1.

Therefore, the return value of newman_prime(3) will be 2 times 1, plus 1, which is 3.
