The function takes two integer arguments x and y.
The function checks if y is less than 0, if it is, it returns the negative of the result of calling the function with the same arguments but with y as a positive number.
If y is equal to 0, the function returns 0.
If y is equal to 1, the function returns x.
Otherwise, the function returns the result of adding x to the result of calling the function with the same arguments but with y decremented by 1.

The function is called with arguments 10 and 20.
The function checks if 20 is less than 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function checks if 20 is equal to 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function checks if 20 is equal to 1, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function returns the result of adding 10 to the result of calling the function with the same arguments but with y decremented by 1, which is 10 + multiply_int(10, 19).

The function is called with arguments 10 and 19.
The function checks if 19 is less than 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function checks if 19 is equal to 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function checks if 19 is equal to 1, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function returns the result of adding 10 to the result of calling the function with the same arguments but with y decremented by 1, which is 10 + multiply_int(10, 18).

The function is called with arguments 10 and 18.
The function checks if 18 is less than 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function checks if 18 is equal to 0, which it is not, so it moves on to the next condition.
The function checks if 18 is equal to 1, which it is not, so it moves on
