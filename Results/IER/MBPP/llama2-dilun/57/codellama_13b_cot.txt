The function takes an array of integers as input.
The length of the array is calculated and stored in the variable n.
The array is sorted in descending order using the sort() method with the reverse parameter set to True.
The first element of the sorted array is stored in the variable num.
The loop iterates from 1 to n-1, and for each iteration, the current element of the array is multiplied by 10 and added to num.
The loop finishes, and the function returns the final value of num, which is 321.
<<<Output>>>
