The function minimum takes two arguments a and b.
The function checks if a is less than or equal to b.
If a is less than or equal to b, the function returns a.
If a is greater than b, the function returns b.
In this case, a is 1 and b is 2.
The function returns 1 because 1 is less than or equal to 2.
