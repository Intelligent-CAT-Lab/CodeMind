<<<Analysis>>>
The function intersection_array takes two arrays as input, array_nums1 and array_nums2.
The function first creates a lambda function that takes an element x as input and checks if x is in array_nums1.
The function then applies this lambda function to array_nums2 using the filter function, which returns a new array containing only the elements that meet the condition.
The function then returns this new array.

In this case, the input arrays are [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10] and [1, 2, 4, 8, 9].
The lambda function will check if each element in the second array is in the first array.
The elements that meet the condition are 1, 2, and 9.
The function will return the array [1, 2, 9].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 9]
