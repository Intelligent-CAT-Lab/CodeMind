The function `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos` takes two integers a and b as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether they differ by only one bit position.
The function first calls the function `is_Power_Of_Two` with the argument `a ^ b`, which is the bitwise XOR of a and b.
The function `is_Power_Of_Two` returns true if its argument is a power of two, and false otherwise.
The function `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos` returns the result of the function call to `is_Power_Of_Two`.

In this case, `a ^ b` is equal to 12, which is not a power of two. Therefore, the function `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos` returns false.

The function `greet` takes a string argument `name` and returns a string that says "Hello, " followed by the value of `name`.
The function `print` is called with the argument `greet("Alice")`, which is the result of calling the function `greet` with the argument "Alice".
The function `greet` returns the string "Hello, Alice".
The function `print` prints the string "Hello, Alice" to the console.

Therefore, the output of the code is "Hello, Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Hello, Alice
