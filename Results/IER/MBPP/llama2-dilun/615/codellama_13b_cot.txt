<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a tuple of tuples as input.
The function first calculates the sum of each tuple using the built-in sum function.
The function then calculates the length of each tuple using the built-in len function.
The function then divides the sum of each tuple by its length to get the average of each tuple.
The function then returns the result, which is a list of averages.

The input to the function is a tuple of tuples, where each tuple has 4 elements.
The function will first calculate the sum of each tuple, which is 10+10+10+12=42, 30+45+56+45=185, 81+80+39+32=252, and 1+2+3+4=10.
The function will then calculate the length of each tuple, which is 4, 4, 4, and 4.
The function will then divide the sum of each tuple by its length to get the average, which is 42/4=10.5, 185/4=46.25, 252/4=63, and 10/4=2.5.
The function will then return the result, which is a list of averages, which is [10.5, 46.25, 63, 2.5].

<<<Output>>>
[10.5, 46.25, 63, 2.5]
