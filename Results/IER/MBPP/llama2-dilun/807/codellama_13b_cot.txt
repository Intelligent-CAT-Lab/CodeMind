The function first_odd takes a list of numbers as input, nums.
The function uses a generator expression to find the first odd number in the list.
The generator expression iterates over the elements in nums and checks if each element is odd.
If an odd number is found, it is returned.
If no odd number is found, -1 is returned.

In this case, the input list is [1,3,5].
The generator expression iterates over the elements in the list and finds that 3 is the first odd number.
Therefore, the function returns 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

The function greet takes a string as input, name.
The function checks if name is not empty or None.
If name is not empty or None, it returns a string "Hello, {name}!".
If name is empty or None, it returns "Hello, Stranger!".

The code then calls the function greet with different inputs:

* greet("Alice")
* greet("")
* greet(None)

The output of the code is:

* "Hello, Alice!"
* "Hello, Stranger!"
* "Hello, Stranger!"

<<<Output>>>
"Hello, Alice!"
"Hello, Stranger!"
"Hello, Stranger!"
