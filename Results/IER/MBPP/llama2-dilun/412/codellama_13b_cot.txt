The function remove_odd takes a list l as input.
The function iterates through the list l and checks if each element i is odd.
If an element i is odd, it removes it from the list l using the remove() method.
The function then returns the modified list l.

In this case, the input list [1,2,3] has one odd element (1), so the function removes it from the list and returns the modified list [2,3].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 3]
