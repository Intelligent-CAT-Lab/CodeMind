The variable test_tup is initialized to the tuple (1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10).
The code enters a loop that iterates over the elements of test_tup.
For each element ele in test_tup, it checks if ele is an instance of tuple.
If it is, it breaks out of the loop and returns the value of count, which is 3.
The loop iterates over the elements of test_tup until it reaches the first tuple, which is (4, 6).
The condition is met when ele is (4, 6), and the loop breaks.
The code returns the final value of count, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
