<<<Analysis>>>
The function sum takes two arguments a and b.
The function first initializes the variable sum to 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the minimum of a and b.
For each number i in this range, the function checks if a and b are divisible by i.
If they are, the function adds i to sum.
The loop finishes when i reaches the minimum of a and b.
The function then returns the final value of sum.
