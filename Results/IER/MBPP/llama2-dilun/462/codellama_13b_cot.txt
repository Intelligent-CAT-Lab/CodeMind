The function takes a list of strings as input.
If the length of the list is 0, the function returns a list containing an empty list.
Otherwise, the function creates an empty list called result.
It then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the list, starting from the second element (index 1).
For each element, it calls the function combinations_list with the remaining elements of the list as input.
It then adds the result of this call to the result list.
It also adds the current element to the result list.
The function then returns the result list.

The function is called with the input list ['orange','red', 'green', 'blue'].
The loop iterates over the elements of the list, starting from the second element.
For each element, it calls the function combinations_list with the remaining elements of the list as input.
