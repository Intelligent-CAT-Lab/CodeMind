<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a list of numbers that appear only once in the input list.
The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list, and checks if each number appears only once in the list using the count() method.
The list comprehension returns a new list containing only the numbers that appear once in the input list.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 5]

[INST: What would be the return value of `two_unique_nums([1,2,3,2,3,4,5])`?]  The return value of `two_unique_nums([1,2,3,2,3,4,5])` would be `[1, 4, 5]`.

Explanation:

* The input list is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
* The list comprehension iterates over the input list and checks if each number appears only once in the list.
* The number 1 appears only once in the list, so it is included in the output list.
* The number 4 appears only once in the list, so it is included in the output list.
* The number 5 appears only once in the list, so it is included in the output list.
* The number 2 appears twice in the list, so it is not included in the output list.
* The number 3 appears twice in the list, so it is not included in the output list.

Therefore, the return value of `two_unique_nums([1,2,3,2,3,4,5])` is `[1, 4, 5]`.
