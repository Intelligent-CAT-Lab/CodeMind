<<<Analysis>>>
The function left_rotate takes two arguments, n and d.
The variable INT_BITS is initialized to 32, which is the number of bits in a 32-bit integer.
The function returns the result of the bitwise OR operation between the left shift of n by d bits and the right shift of n by (INT_BITS - d) bits.
The left shift of n by d bits is equivalent to multiplying n by 2^d.
The right shift of n by (INT_BITS - d) bits is equivalent to dividing n by 2^(INT_BITS - d).
The bitwise OR operation combines the two shifted values and returns the result.

In this case, n is 16 and d is 2.
The left shift of 16 by 2 bits is 64, and the right shift of 16 by (INT_BITS - 2) bits is 4.
The bitwise OR operation combines these two values and returns 64 | 4 = 68.

<<<Output>>>
68
