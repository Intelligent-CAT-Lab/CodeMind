  <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two tuples as input, test_tup1 and test_tup2.
The function first zips the two tuples together to create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the corresponding elements from the two input tuples.
The function then iterates over this list of tuples and multiplies the corresponding elements of each tuple.
The function then creates a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains the result of multiplying the corresponding elements of the two input tuples.
The function then returns this tuple of tuples.
