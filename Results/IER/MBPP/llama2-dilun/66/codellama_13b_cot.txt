<<<Analysis>>>
The function pos_count takes a list as an argument.
The function initializes a variable pos_count to 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates through the list.
For each element in the list, the function checks if the element is greater than or equal to 0.
If the element is greater than or equal to 0, the function increments the variable pos_count by 1.
The function then returns the value of pos_count.

In this case, the list is [1,-2,3,-4].
The function will iterate through the list and check each element.
The first element is 1, which is greater than or equal to 0, so the function will increment pos_count by 1.
The second element is -2, which is less than 0, so the function will not increment pos_count.
The third element is 3, which is greater than or equal to 0, so the function will increment pos_count by 1.
The fourth element is -4, which is less than 0, so the function will not increment pos_count.

After the loop finishes, the function will return the value of pos_count, which is 2.
