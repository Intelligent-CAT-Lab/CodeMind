<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes an array arr as input.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of products of subarrays.
The variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the product of the current subarray.
The variable i is initialized to the length of arr minus 1, which is 2 in this case.
The code enters a loop that iterates from i to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider subarrays from [1,2,3] to [1].
For each subarray, it calculates the product of its elements and stores it in incr.
The code adds incr to ans and updates res to incr.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ans, which is 14.
