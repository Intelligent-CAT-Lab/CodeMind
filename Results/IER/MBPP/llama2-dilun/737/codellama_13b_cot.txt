The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression functionality in Python.
The variable regex is initialized to the regular expression '^[aeiouAEIOU][A-Za-z0-9_]*', which matches a string that starts with a vowel and is followed by any number of letters, digits, or underscores.
The function check_str takes a string as input and returns the result of re.search(regex, string), which searches for the regular expression in the input string.
The code then calls the function with the input string "annie".
<<<Output>>>
<re.Match object; span=(0, 4), match='annie'>
