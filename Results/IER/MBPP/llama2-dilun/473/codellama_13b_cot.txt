<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two lists of tuples as input, test_list1 and test_list2.
The function first converts each tuple in the list to a set of sorted tuples.
The function then takes the intersection of the two sets.
The function then returns the intersection as a set.

The input to the function is:
test_list1 = [(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)]
test_list2 = [(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)]

The output of the function is:
{(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10)}

The function returns the intersection of the two sets, which is the set of tuples that are common to both test_list1 and test_list2.
<<<Output>>>
{(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10)}
