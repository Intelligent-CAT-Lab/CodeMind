The function even_binomial_Coeff_Sum takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of all even binomial coefficients of n.
The function uses the bitwise left shift operator (<<) to compute the sum.
The bitwise left shift operator shifts the bits of a number n places to the left, effectively multiplying it by 2^n.
In this case, the function returns 1 << (n - 1), which is equivalent to 2^(n - 1).
The function returns the sum of all even binomial coefficients of n, which is equal to 2^(n - 1).

The code defines a function greet that takes a string name as input and returns a string "Hello, " + name + "!".
The function is then called with the argument "Alice", which is a string.
The function concatenates the string "Hello, " with the input string "Alice" and the string "!", resulting in the string "Hello, Alice!".
The function returns this string, which is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
Hello, Alice!
