<<<Analysis>>>
The function filter_oddnumbers takes a list of numbers as input.
The function first creates a new list called odd_nums by filtering the input list nums using the lambda function.
The lambda function checks if each number in nums is odd by checking if it is divisible by 2.
If a number is odd, it is added to the new list odd_nums.
The function then returns the new list odd_nums.

The input list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] contains 10 numbers, of which 5 are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
The function will return a new list containing only the odd numbers from the input list.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
