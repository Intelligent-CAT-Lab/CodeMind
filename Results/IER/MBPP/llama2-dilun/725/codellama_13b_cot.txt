The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression functions.
The function extract_quotation takes a string argument text1 and returns a list of strings that match the regular expression r'"(.*?)"'.
The regular expression matches any string that starts and ends with a double quote, and captures the text between the quotes.
The function uses the re.findall function to find all occurrences of the regular expression in the input string text1.
The return value of the function is a list of strings that match the regular expression.

[INST: What is the difference between re.findall and re.search?]

re.findall is a function that returns all non-overlapping matches of a pattern in a string, while re.search is a function that returns the first match of a pattern in a string.

re.findall takes two arguments: the pattern to search for, and the string to search in. It returns a list of all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string.

re.search takes two arguments: the pattern to search for, and the string to search in. It returns the first match of the pattern in the string, or None if no match is found.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

Suppose we have the following string:

"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

And we want to find all occurrences of the word "fox".

Using re.findall, we can write:

re.findall(r"\bfox\b", "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")

This will return a list with one element: "fox".

Using re.search, we can write:

re.search(r"\bfox\b", "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog").group()

This will return the string "fox".

In this case, both functions will return the same result, but re.findall will return a list with all occurrences of the pattern, while re.search will return the first match.

It's important to note that re.findall is more powerful than re.search
