<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments, A and x. A is a list of integers, and x is an integer. The function returns the index of the first occurrence of x in A.
The code first initializes the variables left, right, and result to 0, len(A) - 1, and -1, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates as long as left is less than or equal to right.
The loop first calculates the midpoint of the current range using the formula (left + right) // 2.
The code then checks if x is equal to A[mid]. If it is, the code sets result to mid and right to mid - 1.
If x is less than A[mid], the code sets right to mid - 1.
If x is greater than A[mid], the code sets left to mid + 1.
The loop continues until left is greater than right, at which point the code returns result.

The code processes the input by iterating through the list A and comparing each element to x. If an element is equal to x, the code returns its index. If no element is equal to x, the code returns -1.
