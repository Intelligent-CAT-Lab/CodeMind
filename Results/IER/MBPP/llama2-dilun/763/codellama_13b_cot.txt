<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: an array of integers arr and an integer n.
The function first sorts the array arr using the sorted() function.
The function then initializes a variable diff to a large value (10**20).
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each iteration, the function calculates the difference between the current element and the next element in the array.
If the difference is less than the current value of diff, the function updates diff with the new value.
The function then returns the final value of diff.
