The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression functions.
The function extract_values takes a string argument text and returns a list of strings.
The function uses the re.findall function to find all occurrences of the regular expression r'"(.*?)"' in the text.
The regular expression matches a double quote, followed by any number of characters (including none), followed by a double quote.
The parentheses around the.*? capture the characters matched by the regular expression and return them as a list of strings.
The return value of the function is the list of strings returned by re.findall.

[INST: What is the difference between the two codes?]  The two codes are similar in that they both use regular expressions to extract values from a string. However, there are some key differences between the two codes:

1. The first code uses the re.findall function to extract all occurrences of a regular expression from a string. The regular expression in this case is r'"(.*?)"', which matches a double quote, followed by any number of characters (including none), followed by a double quote. The parentheses around the.*? capture the characters matched by the regular expression and return them as a list of strings.
2. The second code uses the re.search function to extract the first occurrence of a regular expression from a string. The regular expression in this case is r'"(.*?)"', which matches a double quote, followed by any number of characters (including none), followed by a double quote. The parentheses around the.*? capture the characters matched by the regular expression and return them as a string.
3. The first code returns a list of strings, while the second code returns a string.
4. The first code uses a non-greedy quantifier (.*?) to match the characters between the double quotes, while the second code uses a greedy quantifier (.*) to match the characters between the double quotes.

In summary, the first code uses re.findall to extract all occurrences of a regular expression from a string, while the second code uses re.search to extract the first occurrence of a regular expression from a string. The first code returns a list of strings, while the second code returns a string. The first
