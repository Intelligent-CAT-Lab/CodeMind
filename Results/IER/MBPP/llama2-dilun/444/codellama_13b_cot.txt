The function takes two arguments: test_list, which is a list of tuples, and K, which is an integer.
The function creates an empty list called res.
It then iterates over each tuple in test_list and appends a new tuple to res.
The new tuple is created by slicing the original tuple, starting from the Kth index (inclusive) and ending at the last index (exclusive).
The function then returns the string representation of res.

In this case, the input is:
test_list = [(5, 3, 2, 1, 4), (3, 4, 9, 2, 1), (9, 1, 2, 3, 5), (4, 8, 2, 1, 7)]
K = 2

The function will iterate over each tuple in test_list and append a new tuple to res.
For the first tuple, it will slice it starting from the 2nd index (inclusive) and ending at the last index (exclusive), which is (3, 2, 1, 4).
For the second tuple, it will slice it starting from the 2nd index (inclusive) and ending at the last index (exclusive), which is (4, 9, 2, 1).
For the third tuple, it will slice it starting from the 2nd index (inclusive) and ending at the last index (exclusive), which is (1, 2, 3, 5).
For the fourth tuple, it will slice it starting from the 2nd index (inclusive) and ending at the last index (exclusive), which is (8, 2, 1, 7).

The final value of res will be:
[(3, 2, 1, 4), (4, 9, 2, 1), (1, 2, 3, 5), (8, 2, 1, 7)]

The function will then return the string representation of res, which is:
"[(3, 2, 1, 4), (4, 9, 2, 1), (1, 2, 3,
