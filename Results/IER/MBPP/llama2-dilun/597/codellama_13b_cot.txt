The function takes three arguments: arr1, arr2, and k.
The first two arguments are lists of integers, and the third argument is an integer.
The function returns the kth element of the sorted array obtained by merging arr1 and arr2.
The function first initializes the sorted array sorted1 to be of length m + n, where m and n are the lengths of arr1 and arr2, respectively.
The function then initializes three variables: i, j, and d.
i is initialized to 0, which will be used to iterate over arr1.
j is initialized to 0, which will be used to iterate over arr2.
d is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current index in sorted1.
The function then enters a loop that iterates while both i and j are less than their respective lengths.
In each iteration, the function checks if the current element of arr1 is less than the current element of arr2.
If it is, the function adds the current element of arr1 to sorted1 and increments i.
If not, the function adds the current element of arr2 to sorted1 and increments j.
The function then increments d.
After the loop finishes, the function enters two more loops that iterate while i or j is less than their respective lengths.
In each iteration, the function adds the current element of arr1 or arr2 to sorted1 and increments the corresponding variable.
The function then returns the kth element of sorted1.

[INST: What is the time complexity of the given code?]  The time complexity of the given code is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of arr1 and arr2, respectively.

The outer loop iterates m + n times, and each iteration takes constant time to execute.
Therefore, the time complexity of the code is O(m + n).
