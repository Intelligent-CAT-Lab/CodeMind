The function rectangle_area takes two arguments, l and b, which represent the length and breadth of a rectangle, respectively.
The function calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying l and b and returns the result.
In this case, the function is called with arguments 10 and 20, which represent the length and breadth of a rectangle, respectively.
The function calculates the area of the rectangle as 10*20=200.

[INST: What would be the return value of `rectangle_area(10,20,30)`?]

The function `rectangle_area` takes two arguments, `l` and `b`, which represent the length and breadth of a rectangle, respectively.
The function calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying `l` and `b` and returns the result.
In this case, the function is called with three arguments, `10`, `20`, and `30`.
The function calculates the area of the rectangle as `10*20*30=6000`.

Therefore, the return value of `rectangle_area(10,20,30)` would be `6000`.

It's important to note that the function `rectangle_area` is defined to take two arguments, `l` and `b`, and it's not designed to handle more than two arguments.
If you call the function with more than two arguments, it will only use the first two arguments and ignore the rest.

In this case, the function is called with three arguments, `10`, `20`, and `30`, but it only uses the first two arguments, `10` and `20`, to calculate the area of the rectangle.
The third argument, `30`, is ignored by the function.

Therefore, the return value of `rectangle_area(10,20,30)` would be `6000`, which is the area of the rectangle with length `10` and breadth `20`.

It's important to understand the behavior of the function and the arguments it takes to avoid unexpected results
