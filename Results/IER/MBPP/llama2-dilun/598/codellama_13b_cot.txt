<<<Analysis>>>
The function armstrong_number takes a single argument, number, which is an integer.
The function first initializes two variables, sum and times, to 0.
The function then assigns the value of number to a temporary variable, temp.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates while temp is greater than 0.
For each iteration, the function increments the value of times by 1.
The function then divides temp by 10 and assigns the result to temp.
The function then enters another while loop that iterates while temp is greater than 0.
For each iteration, the function calculates the remainder of temp divided by 10 and assigns the result to reminder.
The function then calculates the power of reminder to the power of times and adds the result to sum.
The function then divides temp by 10 and assigns the result to temp.
The function then checks if number is equal to sum.
If the condition is met, the function returns True.
If the condition is not met, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
True
