<<<Analysis>>>
The function div_list takes two lists as input, nums1 and nums2.
The function first applies the map function to the two lists, which applies the lambda function to each pair of elements in the two lists.
The lambda function takes two arguments, x and y, and divides x by y.
The result of the map function is a map object, which is then converted to a list using the list function.
The function returns the resulting list.

In this case, the input to the function is [4,5,6] and [1, 2, 3].
The lambda function will divide each element in the first list by the corresponding element in the second list.
The resulting list will be [4/1, 5/2, 6/3] = [4, 2.5, 2].

<<<Output>>>
[4, 2.5, 2]
