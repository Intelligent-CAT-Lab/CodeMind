<<<Analysis>>>
The function parabola_directrix takes three arguments: a, b, and c.
The function calculates the directrix of a parabola with the equation y = ax^2 + bx + c.
The directrix is the line that passes through the focus and is perpendicular to the parabola.
The function first calculates the distance between the focus and the directrix using the formula:
directrix = (c - ((b * b) + 1) * 4 * a)
The function then returns the value of directrix.
