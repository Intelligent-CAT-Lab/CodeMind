<<<Analysis>>>
The function snake_to_camel takes a string argument word and returns a string.
The function uses the re module to split the word argument into a list of substrings using the underscore character as the delimiter.
The list of substrings is then joined together using the join method, with each substring capitalized using the capitalize method.
The function returns the resulting string.

In this case, the input to the function is 'android_tv', which is split into a list of substrings ['android', 'tv'].
The substrings are then joined together with the join method, with each substring capitalized using the capitalize method.
The resulting string is 'AndroidTv'.
<<<Output>>>
'AndroidTv'
