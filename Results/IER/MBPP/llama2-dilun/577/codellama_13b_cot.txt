The variable n is initialized to 4, which is the input to the function.
The code then enters an if-else block that checks the value of n.
The first condition is that n must be equal to 0, which is not the case here.
The second condition is that n must be less than or equal to 2, which is also not the case here.
The third condition is that n must be equal to 3, which is also not the case here.
The fourth condition is that n must be equal to 4, which is the case here.
The code then returns 4, which is the last digit of the factorial of 4.
<<<Output>>>
