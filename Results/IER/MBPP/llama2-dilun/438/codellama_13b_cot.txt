  <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of tuples as input.
The function iterates through the list of tuples and checks if the first element of each tuple is equal to the second element of the next tuple.
If the condition is met, the function increments the variable res by 1.
The function returns the final value of res.

[INST: What would be the return value of `count_bidirectional([(5, 6), (1, 2), (6, 5), (9, 1), (6, 5), (2, 1)] )`?]  The function would return 3.

Explanation:

1. The first element of the first tuple is 5, and the second element is 6.
2. The first element of the second tuple is 1, and the second element is 2.
3. The first element of the third tuple is 6, and the second element is 5.
4. The first element of the fourth tuple is 9, and the second element is 1.
5. The first element of the fifth tuple is 6, and the second element is 5.
6. The first element of the sixth tuple is 2, and the second element is 1.

The function would increment the variable res by 1 for each tuple that meets the condition, which would be tuples 1, 3, and 6. Therefore, the return value would be 3.
