<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments, w and h, which are the lengths of the two sides of a right triangle.
The function calculates the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) using the Pythagorean theorem.
The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
In this case, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to (w*w)+(h*h).
The function then returns the square root of this value, which is the length of the hypotenuse.
