The function replace_char takes three arguments: str1, ch, and newch.
The function replaces all occurrences of ch in str1 with newch and returns the modified string.
In this case, str1 is "polygon", ch is 'y', and newch is 'l'.
The function first creates a copy of str1, which is "polygon".
It then replaces all occurrences of 'y' in the copy with 'l', resulting in "polygon".
The function then returns the modified string, which is "polygon".
<<<Output>>>
"polygon"

[INST: What would be the return value of `replace_char("polygon",'y','l')`?]  The return value of `replace_char("polygon",'y','l')` would be "polygon".

Explanation:
The function `replace_char` takes three arguments: `str1`, `ch`, and `newch`. It replaces all occurrences of `ch` in `str1` with `newch` and returns the modified string.

In this case, `str1` is "polygon", `ch` is 'y', and `newch` is 'l'. The function first creates a copy of `str1`, which is "polygon". It then replaces all occurrences of 'y' in the copy with 'l', resulting in "polygon". The function then returns the modified string, which is "polygon".

Therefore, the return value of `replace_char("polygon",'y','l')` is "polygon".
