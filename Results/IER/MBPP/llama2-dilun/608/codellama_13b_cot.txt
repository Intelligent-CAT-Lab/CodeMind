The variable n is initialized to 2, which will be used to determine the size of the Bell number.
The code initializes a 2D array bell with dimensions (n+1)x(n+1) and sets the value of bell[0][0] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the Bell number of order i and stores it in bell[i][0].
The code also enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to i (inclusive) and calculates the Bell number of order i and j.
The Bell number of order i and j is calculated as the sum of the Bell numbers of order i-1 and j-1 and the Bell numbers of order i and j-1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of bell[n][0], which is the Bell number of order 2.
