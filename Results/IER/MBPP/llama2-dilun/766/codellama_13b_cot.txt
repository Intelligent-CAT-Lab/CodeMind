<<<Analysis>>>
The function pair_wise takes a list l1 as input.
The function first initializes an empty list temp.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(l1) - 1.
For each iteration, the function extracts the current element and the next element from the list l1 using the indices i and i + 1.
The function then creates a tuple x with the current element and the next element.
The function then appends the tuple x to the list temp.
The function repeats this process until the loop finishes.
The function then returns the list temp.

The input list [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,5] has 8 elements.
The function will iterate from 0 to 7, which means it will consider pairs of elements from the list.
The function will append the following tuples to the list temp:
(1,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)
The function will then return the list temp, which will contain the following elements:
[(1,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)]

<<<Output>>>
[(1,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)]
