<<<Analysis>>>
The function remove_elements takes two lists as input: list1 and list2.
The function creates a new list called result, which will contain the elements of list1 that are not in list2.
The function uses a list comprehension to create the result list. The comprehension iterates over the elements of list1 and checks if each element is in list2. If it is not, the element is added to the result list.
The function then returns the result list.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
