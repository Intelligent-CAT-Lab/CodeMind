The variable L is initialized to [11, 33, 50], which is a list of integers.
The code then joins the elements of L into a single string using the "".join() method.
The map() function is used to convert each element of L to a string.
The resulting string is then converted to an integer using the int() function.
The code returns the resulting integer.

The resulting string is "113350", which is converted to the integer 113350.
