The variable n is initialized to 15.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the length of the list of numbers from 1 to n+1 that are divisible by i.
The code then returns the final value of x, which is the length of the list of divisors of n.
