<<<Analysis>>>
The function heap_queue_largest takes two arguments: nums and n.
nums is a list of integers, and n is an integer.
The function uses the heapq module to find the n largest elements in the list nums.
The function first imports the heapq module as hq.
The function then defines a function called largest_nums, which takes two arguments: nums and n.
The function uses the nlargest function from the heapq module to find the n largest elements in the list nums.
The function then returns the list of the n largest elements.
<<<Output>>>
