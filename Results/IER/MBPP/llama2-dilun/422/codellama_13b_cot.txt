The variable n is initialized to 2, which means the code will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the cube of i and adds it to the sum.
The cube of i is calculated as i * i * i.
The code then divides the sum by n, which is 2 in this case, and rounds the result to 6 decimal places.
The final value of the sum is 1 + 8 + 27 = 36.
The final value of the average is 36 / 2 = 18.
<<<Output>>>
18

The variable n is initialized to 3, which means the code will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the cube of i and adds it to the sum.
The cube of i is calculated as i * i * i.
The code then divides the sum by n, which is 3 in this case, and rounds the result to 6 decimal places.
The final value of the sum is 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 94.
The final value of the average is 94 / 3 = 31.333333.
