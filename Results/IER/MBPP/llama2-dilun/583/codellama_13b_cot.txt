The function catalan_number takes an integer argument num.
The function first checks if num is less than or equal to 1, and if it is, it returns 1.
If num is greater than 1, the function enters a loop that iterates from 0 to num-1.
For each iteration, the function calls itself recursively with the arguments i and num-i-1.
The function then multiplies the result of the two recursive calls and adds it to res_num.
After the loop finishes, the function returns res_num.

The Catalan number is a sequence of numbers that occurs in various counting problems, such as the number of expressions that can be formed by properly nesting parentheses.
The sequence starts with 1,1,2,5,14,42,132,429,1430,4862,16796,51470,176727,590594,2036477,7054913,24466264,86504142,293292910,961893230,3609672160,12799032000,47667774400,176727275200,608122440640,2164273632480,7325462655200,24676712496000,80658175680000,267856361024000,904352776800000,3402927968000000,12493694096000000,46681003200000000,16777216000000000,5368709120
