<<<Analysis>>>
The function neg_nos takes a list of numbers as input.
The function creates an empty list called out.
The function then iterates through the list of numbers and checks if each number is less than 0.
If a number is less than 0, it is appended to the out list.
The function then returns the out list.

In this case, the input list is [-1,4,5,-6].
The function will iterate through the list and find that -1 and -6 are less than 0.
It will then append these numbers to the out list, resulting in [-1,-6].
The function will then return the out list, which is [-1,-6].
<<<Output>>>
[-1,-6]
