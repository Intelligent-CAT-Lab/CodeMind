<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two lists as input, lst1 and lst2.
The code creates a new list res_list, which will contain the sum of the corresponding elements of lst1 and lst2.
The code then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the range of indices of lst1, and for each index i, it calculates the sum of the elements at index i in lst1 and lst2, and appends the result to res_list.
The code then returns res_list.
<<<Output>>>
[25, 45, 65]
