The function check_Consecutive takes a list l as input.
The function first sorts the list l using the sorted() function.
The function then checks if the sorted list is equal to the list of numbers from the minimum value of l to the maximum value of l plus one.
The function returns True if the two lists are equal, and False otherwise.

In this case, the input list is [1,2,3,4,5].
The sorted list is [1,2,3,4,5].
The list of numbers from the minimum value of the input list to the maximum value of the input list plus one is [1,2,3,4,5].
Since the two lists are equal, the function returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
