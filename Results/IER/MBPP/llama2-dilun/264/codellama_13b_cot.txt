<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h_age is initialized to 12.
The code checks if h_age is less than 0, which is not the case.
The code then checks if h_age is less than or equal to 2, which is not the case.
The code then enters the else block and calculates the dog age as 21 + (h_age - 2)*4.
The dog age is calculated as 21 + (12 - 2)*4 = 21 + 10*4 = 21 + 40 = 61.
The code returns the dog age, which is 61.
<<<Output>>>
61

[INST: What would be the return value of `dog_age(0)`?]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h_age is initialized to 0.
The code checks if h_age is less than 0, which is true.
The code exits the function without returning a value.
Since the function exits without returning a value, the return value is None.
<<<Output>>>
None

[INST: What would be the return value of `dog_age(-1)`?]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h_age is initialized to -1.
The code checks if h_age is less than 0, which is true.
The code exits the function without returning a value.
Since the function exits without returning a value, the return value is None.
<<<Output>>>

[INST: What would be the return value of `dog_age(3)`?]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h_age is initialized to 3.
The code checks if h_age is less than 0, which is not the case.
The code then checks if h_age is less than or equal to 2, which is true.
The code calculates the dog age as h_age * 10.5, which is 3 * 10.5 = 30.
The code returns the dog age, which is 30.
