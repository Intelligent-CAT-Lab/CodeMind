The code first checks if a is greater than b. Since a is 25 and b is 55, the condition is not met.
The code then checks if a is greater than c. Since a is 25 and c is 65, the condition is not met.
The code then checks if b is greater than c. Since b is 55 and c is 65, the condition is met.
The code then returns b, which is 55.

[INST: What would be the return value of `median_numbers(25,55,65)`?]  The return value of `median_numbers(25,55,65)` would be 55.

Explanation:
The function first checks if the first argument (25) is greater than the second argument (55). Since 25 is not greater than 55, the function moves on to the next condition.
The function then checks if the first argument (25) is greater than the third argument (65). Since 25 is not greater than 65, the function moves on to the next condition.
The function then checks if the second argument (55) is greater than the third argument (65). Since 55 is greater than 65, the function returns 55.

Therefore, the return value of `median_numbers(25,55,65)` is 55.
