The function is_woodall takes an integer x as input.
The function first checks if x is even by checking if x % 2 == 0. If it is, it returns False.
The function then checks if x is equal to 1. If it is, it returns True.
The function then increments x by 1 and sets p to 0.
The function then enters a loop that repeatedly divides x by 2 and increments p by 1 until x is odd.
The function checks if p is equal to x. If it is, it returns True.
The function returns False otherwise.

The input x is 383.
The function first checks if 383 is even. It is not, so it moves on to the next step.
The function checks if 383 is equal to 1. It is not, so it moves on to the next step.
The function increments 383 by 1 to get 384.
The function then enters the loop.
The function divides 384 by 2 to get 192.
The function increments p by 1 to get 1.
The function checks if p is equal to 192. It is not, so it moves on to the next step.
The function divides 192 by 2 to get 96.
The function increments p by 1 to get 2.
The function checks if p is equal to 96. It is not, so it moves on to the next step.
The function divides 96 by 2 to get 48.
The function increments p by 1 to get 3.
The function checks if p is equal to 48. It is not, so it moves on to the next step.
The function divides 48 by 2 to get 24.
The function increments p by 1 to get 4.
The function checks if p is equal to 24. It is not, so it moves on to the next step.
The function divides 24 by 2 to get 12.
The function increments p by 1 to get 5.
The function checks if p is equal to 12. It is not,
