The function takes an array as input and sorts it.
The function then initializes a variable sum to the first element of the array.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of the array (exclusive), meaning it will consider all elements except the last one.
For each element i in this range, the function checks if the current element is not equal to the next element. If it is, it adds the next element to the sum.
The function then returns the final value of sum.

[INST: What would be the return value of `find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6])`?]  The return value of `find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6])` would be 15.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the code:

1. The function takes the array `[1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]` as input and sorts it to `[1,1,1,2,3,4,5,6]`.
2. The function initializes the variable `sum` to the first element of the array, which is `1`.
3. The function enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of the array (exclusive), which is 7.
4. For each element `i` in this range, the function checks if the current element is not equal to the next element.
5. Since the first element is `1`, the function adds the next element `2` to the sum, which is now `1 + 2 = 3`.
6. The function then moves on to the next element, which is `1`, and since it is equal to the next element `1`, it does not add it to the sum.
7. The function then moves on to the next element, which is `4`, and since it is not equal to the next element `5`, it adds it to the sum, which is now `3 + 4 = 7`.
8. The function then moves on to the next element, which is `5`, and since it is not equal to the next element `6`, it adds
