The function next_power_of_2 takes an integer n as input.
The function first checks if n is 0, and if it is, it returns 0.
If n is not 0, the function checks if n is a power of 2. If it is, it returns n.
If n is not a power of 2, the function calculates the next power of 2 by counting the number of bits needed to represent n.
The function then returns the next power of 2.
