The function takes a list as input, which is the argument passed to the function.
The function then iterates through the list and checks the type of each element.
If the element is a list, it recursively calls the function with the element as the argument.
If the element is not a list, it adds the element to the total.
The function returns the total.

In this case, the input list is [[1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]]].
The function iterates through the list and finds that the first element is 1, which is not a list. It adds 1 to the total.
The function then finds that the second element is 2, which is not a list. It adds 2 to the total.
The function then finds that the third element is a list. It recursively calls the function with the list as the argument.
The function iterates through the list and finds that the first element is 3, which is not a list. It adds 3 to the total.
The function then finds that the second element is 4, which is not a list. It adds 4 to the total.
The function then finds that the third element is a list. It recursively calls the function with the list as the argument.
The function iterates through the list and finds that the first element is 5, which is not a list. It adds 5 to the total.
The function then finds that the second element is 6, which is not a list. It adds 6 to the total.
The function then returns the total, which is 15.

The function then continues to iterate through the list and finds that the fourth element is a list. It recursively calls the function with the list as the argument.
The function iterates through the list and finds that the first element is 7, which is not a list. It adds 7 to the total.
The function then finds that the second element is 8, which is not a list. It adds 8 to the total.
The function then finds that the third element is a list. It recursively calls the function with the list as the argument.
The function iterates through the list and finds that the first element is 9, which is not a list. It adds 9 to the total.
The function then finds
