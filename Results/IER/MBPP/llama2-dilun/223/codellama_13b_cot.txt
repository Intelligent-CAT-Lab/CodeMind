  <<<Analysis>>>
The function is_majority takes in an array arr, an integer n, and an integer x.
The function binary_search takes in an array arr, two integers low and high, and an integer x.
The function is_majority first calls the binary_search function to find the index of the element x in the array arr.
If the element is not found, the function returns False.
If the element is found, the function checks if the element is a majority element.
A majority element is an element that appears more than n//2 times in the array.
The function checks if the element is a majority element by checking if the element is in the middle of the array and if the element is equal to x.
If the element is a majority element, the function returns True.
If the element is not a majority element, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
True

[INST: What is the time complexity of the is_majority function?]  <<<Analysis>>>
The time complexity of the is_majority function is O(log n) because the binary_search function has a time complexity of O(log n) and the function calls the binary_search function once.
The time complexity of the binary_search function is O(log n) because it uses the divide and conquer approach to find the index of the element x in the array arr.
The function calls itself recursively until it finds the index of the element x or until it reaches the end of the array.
The number of times the function calls itself is logarithmic in the size of the array.
<<<Output>>>
O(log n)

[INST: What is the space complexity of the is_majority function?]  <<<Analysis>>>
The space complexity of the is_majority function is O(1) because the function does not use any additional space beyond the space used by the input parameters.
The function does not create any additional data structures or variables.
The function only uses the input parameters and the return value.
<<<Output>>>
O(1)
