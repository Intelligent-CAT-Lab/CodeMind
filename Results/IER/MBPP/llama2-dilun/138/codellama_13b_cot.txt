The function is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two takes an integer n as input.
The function first checks if n is odd by checking if n % 2 == 1.
If n is odd, the function returns False.
If n is even, the function returns True.

In this case, the input is 10, which is even.
The function returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True

The function sum_of_squares takes a list of numbers as input.
The function uses a generator expression to calculate the square of each number in the list and then sums them up using the sum() function.

In this case, the input is [1, 2, 3], which means the function will calculate the square of each number and then sum them up.
The squares of 1, 2, and 3 are 1, 4, and 9, respectively.
The function returns the sum of these squares, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
