The variable n is initialized to 2, which means the loop will iterate from 1 to 3 (inclusive).
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the cube of 2i and adds it to the sum.
The cube of 2i is (2i)^3 = 8i^3.
The code then adds the cube of 2i to the sum.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum, which is 108.
<<<Output>>>
