<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes three lists as input: list1, list2, and list3.
The function first creates a list of tuples by zipping the three lists together.
The function then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the tuples and check if the first element of each tuple is equal to the second element, and the second element is equal to the third element.
The function then uses the sum function to count the number of times the condition is met.
The function finally returns the result.

In this case, the input lists are:
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
list2 = [2,2,3,1,2,6,7,9]
list3 = [2,1,3,1,2,6,7,9]

The function will iterate over the tuples and check if the first element of each tuple is equal to the second element, and the second element is equal to the third element.
The function will return the number of times the condition is met, which is 4.

<<<Output>>>
4
