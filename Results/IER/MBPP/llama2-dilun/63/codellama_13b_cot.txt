<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains two integers.
The function calculates the absolute difference between each pair of integers in the list and stores the result in a temporary list called temp.
The function then finds the maximum value in the temp list and returns it.

In this case, the input list is [(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)].
The function calculates the absolute difference between each pair of integers in the list as follows:

* (3, 5) -> 2
* (1, 7) -> 6
* (10, 3) -> 7
* (1, 2) -> 1

The maximum value in the temp list is 7, which is the absolute difference between (10, 3).

Therefore, the return value of the function is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
