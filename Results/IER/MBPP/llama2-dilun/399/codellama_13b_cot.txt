<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two tuples as input, test_tup1 and test_tup2.
The function uses the zip() function to iterate over the two tuples simultaneously.
For each pair of elements in the two tuples, it performs a bitwise XOR operation and stores the result in a new tuple.
The function then returns the new tuple.

In this case, the input tuples are (10, 4, 6, 9) and (5, 2, 3, 3).
The bitwise XOR operation for each pair of elements in the two tuples is as follows:

* 10 ^ 5 = 5
* 4 ^ 2 = 6
* 6 ^ 3 = 5
* 9 ^ 3 = 6

Therefore, the return value of the function is (5, 6, 5, 6).
<<<Output>>>
(5, 6, 5, 6)
