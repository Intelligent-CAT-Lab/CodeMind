<<<Analysis>>>
The function Split takes a list as an argument and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.
The code uses a list comprehension to create the new list. It iterates over the elements of the original list and checks if each element is even. If it is, it adds it to the new list.
The code then returns the new list.

[2, 4]
