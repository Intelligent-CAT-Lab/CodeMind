The function is_octagonal takes an integer n as input and returns a value.
The function body consists of a single line of code that returns the expression 3 * n * n - 2 * n.
The function does not have any side effects or modify any external state.
The function is a pure function, meaning that it only depends on its input and does not have any external dependencies.
The function is deterministic, meaning that it always returns the same output given the same input.
