<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and returns the number of rotations required to make the string palindrome.
The function first concatenates the input string with itself to create a temporary string.
The function then iterates through the temporary string and checks if the substring of length equal to the length of the input string is equal to the input string.
If the substring is equal to the input string, the function returns the index of the substring.
If the substring is not equal to the input string, the function continues to iterate through the temporary string.
If the function reaches the end of the temporary string without finding a match, it returns the length of the input string.
