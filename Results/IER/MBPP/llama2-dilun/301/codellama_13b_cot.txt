The function dict_depth takes a dictionary as input and returns the depth of the dictionary.
The function first checks if the input is a dictionary using the isinstance function. If it is not, it returns 0.
If the input is a dictionary, it returns 1 + the maximum depth of the values in the dictionary.
The maximum depth of the values is calculated using the map function, which applies the dict_depth function to each value in the dictionary.
The function then adds 1 to the maximum depth to account for the current level of the dictionary.

The input to the function is {'a':1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}.
The function first checks if the input is a dictionary, which it is.
It then calculates the maximum depth of the values in the dictionary, which is 3 (the depth of {'c': {'d': {}}} is 3).
It then adds 1 to the maximum depth to account for the current level of the dictionary, which is 4.
The final output of the function is 4.
