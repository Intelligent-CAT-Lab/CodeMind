<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains a student's name and their marks.
The function first creates a defaultdict object called temp, which is a dictionary that has an integer value of 0 for each key.
The function then iterates over the input list and for each tuple, it updates the value of the corresponding key in temp by adding the marks to the existing value.
The function then returns the maximum value of the items in temp, which is the student with the highest total marks.

In this case, the input list is [('Juan Whelan',90),('Sabah Colley',88),('Peter Nichols',7),('Juan Whelan',122),('Sabah Colley',84)].
After updating the values in temp, the dictionary would look like this:
temp = {'Juan Whelan': 212, 'Sabah Colley': 172, 'Peter Nichols': 7}
The function then returns the maximum value of the items in temp, which is ('Juan Whelan', 212).
<<<Output>>>
('Juan Whelan', 212)
