The variable n is initialized to 2, which is passed as an argument to the function.
The code imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The function finds the index of the number by calculating the square root of 2 times 10 raised to the power of (n-1).
The function then rounds the result to the nearest integer using the round() function.
The code returns the final value of x, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
