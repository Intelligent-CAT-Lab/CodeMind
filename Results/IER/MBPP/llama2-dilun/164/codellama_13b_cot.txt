The function div_sum takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of all divisors of n.
The function are_equivalent takes two integers num1 and num2 as input and returns True if the sum of divisors of num1 is equal to the sum of divisors of num2, and False otherwise.
The code first defines a function div_sum that takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of all divisors of n.
The function div_sum first initializes a variable total to 1, which will be used to accumulate the sum of divisors.
It then initializes a variable i to 2, which will be used to iterate through the divisors of n.
The code enters a while loop that iterates as long as i squared is less than or equal to n.
For each divisor i, the code checks if n is divisible by i, and if it is, it adds i and the largest integer less than or equal to n divided by i to the total.
The code then returns the final value of total.
The function are_equivalent takes two integers num1 and num2 as input and returns True if the sum of divisors of num1 is equal to the sum of divisors of num2, and False otherwise.
The code first calls the function div_sum with num1 as input and stores the result in a variable sum1.
It then calls the function div_sum with num2 as input and stores the result in a variable sum2.
The code then returns True if sum1 is equal to sum2, and False otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
False

[INST: What is the difference between the two functions?]  The two functions are_equivalent and div_sum have different purposes.
The function div_sum takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of all divisors of n.
The function are_equivalent takes two integers num1 and num2 as input and returns True if the sum of divisors of num1 is equal to the sum of divisors of num2, and False otherwise.
The function div_sum calculates the sum of divisors of a single integer, while the function are_equivalent compares the sum of divisors of two different integers.
The function div_sum is used to calculate
