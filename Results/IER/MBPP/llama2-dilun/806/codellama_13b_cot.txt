The variable test_str is initialized to 'GeMKSForGERksISBESt'.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in test_str.
For each character, it checks if it is uppercase using the isupper() method.
If it is uppercase, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
If it is not uppercase, it sets the variable res to the current value of cnt and sets cnt to 0.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the last character in test_str is uppercase.
If it is, it sets the variable res to the current value of cnt.
Finally, the code returns the value of res.
