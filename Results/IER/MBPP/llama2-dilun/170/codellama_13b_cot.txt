The variable list1 is initialized to [2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12], which is a list of 12 integers.
The variables m and n are initialized to 8 and 10, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from m to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider the elements at indices 8, 9, and 10.
For each element i in this range, it adds the element at index i in list1 to sum_range.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_range, which is 24.
