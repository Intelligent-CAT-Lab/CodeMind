The function right_insertion takes two arguments, a list a and a number x.
The function returns the index where x should be inserted into a to maintain the sorted order of the list.
The function uses the bisect module to perform the binary search.
The bisect module provides the bisect_right function, which takes two arguments, a list and a number.
The function returns the index where the number should be inserted into the list to maintain the sorted order.
