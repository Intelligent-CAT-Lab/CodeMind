The variable s is initialized to '112112', which is a string of length 6.
The code imports the defaultdict class from the collections module, which is a dictionary that returns a default value when a key is not found.
The function count_Substrings takes a string s as input and returns the number of substrings of s that have a sum of their digits equal to 0.
The code initializes two variables, count and sum, to 0.
The code then initializes a dictionary mp to defaultdict(lambda : 0), which is a dictionary that maps each sum of digits to the number of substrings that have that sum.
The code sets mp[0] to 1, which means that there is one substring of length 0 with a sum of 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1, where n is the length of s.
For each iteration, the code calculates the sum of the digits of the substring s[i:i+1] and stores it in sum.
The code then checks if mp[sum - (i + 1)] is greater than 0, which means that there is at least one substring of length i+1 with a sum of digits equal to sum - (i + 1).
If this is the case, the code increments the value of count by the number of substrings of length i+1 with a sum of digits equal to sum - (i + 1).
The code then increments mp[sum - (i + 1)] by 1, which means that there is now one more substring of length i+1 with a sum of digits equal to sum - (i + 1).
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of count, which is the number of substrings of s that have a sum of their digits equal to 0.

[INST: What is the purpose of the lambda function in the defaultdict?]  The lambda function in the defaultdict is used to set the default value of the dictionary to 0.

When a key is not found in the dictionary, the default value is returned instead of raising a KeyError.

In this case, the default value is set to 0,
