<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns True if all the numbers at odd positions are odd, and all the numbers at even positions are even.
The code uses the built-in all() function to check if all the elements in the list satisfy the condition.
The condition is that the number at an odd position is odd if the index of the number is odd, and the number at an even position is even if the index of the number is even.
The code uses the modulo operator (%) to check if the index of the number is odd or even.
The code then returns the result of the all() function, which is True if all the elements in the list satisfy the condition, and False otherwise.
