The code takes a string as input and returns a string containing only the odd-indexed characters of the input string.
The code first initializes an empty string result.
It then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the input string.
For each iteration, it checks if the current index i is even or odd.
If it is even, it does not do anything.
If it is odd, it appends the character at the current index i to the result string.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of result.
