The function test_three_equal takes three arguments x, y, and z.
The function first creates a set from the three arguments using the set() function.
The set is then checked to see if it has a length of 3, which means that all three arguments are equal.
If the length of the set is 3, the function returns 0.
If the length of the set is not 3, the function returns 4 minus the length of the set.

In this case, the input to the function is (1,1,1), which means that the set created from the three arguments will have a length of 1.
Since the length of the set is not 3, the function will return 4 minus the length of the set, which is 4 - 1 = 3.

The code defines a function called greet that takes a single argument called name.
The function checks if the value of name is "Alice", "Bob", or any other value.
If the value of name is "Alice", the function returns the string "Hello, Alice!".
If the value of name is "Bob", the function returns the string "Hello, Bob!".
If the value of name is any other value, the function returns the string "Hello, " concatenated with the value of name concatenated with the string "!".

The code then calls the greet function with the argument "Charlie".
The function will return the string "
