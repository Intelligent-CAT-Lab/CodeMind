<<<Analysis>>>
The variable side is initialized to 3.
The code imports the math module and uses the math.sqrt function to calculate the square root of 3.
The code then calculates the area of the tetrahedron using the formula:
area = math.sqrt(3)*(side*side)
The code returns the final value of area, which is 18.
<<<Output>>>
