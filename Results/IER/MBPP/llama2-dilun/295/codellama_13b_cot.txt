The variable number is initialized to 8.
The code initializes an empty list called divisors and appends the number 1 to it.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to number (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 7.
For each number i in this range, it checks if number is divisible by i. If it is, it appends i to divisors. The condition is met when i is 2,4 and 8.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the sum of the elements in divisors, which is 1+2+4+8=15.
<<<Output>>>
