The function is_Sub_Array takes two arrays A and B as input.
The function first calculates the length of both arrays, n and m, respectively.
The function then initializes two indices, i and j, to 0.
The function enters a while loop that iterates as long as both i and j are less than their respective lengths.
The loop checks if the element at index i in array A is equal to the element at index j in array B.
If the elements are equal, the function increments both i and j by 1.
If the elements are not equal, the function sets i to i - j + 1 and j to 0.
The function then checks if j has reached the end of array B, and if it has, it returns True.
If the loop exits without returning True, the function returns False.
