<<<Analysis>>>
The function left_insertion takes two arguments, a and x.
a is a list of integers, and x is an integer.
The function uses the bisect module to find the index of the first element in a that is greater than or equal to x.
The index is stored in the variable i.
The function returns the value of i.

In this case, the list a is [1,2,4,5], and x is 6.
The function bisect_left will return the index of the first element in a that is greater than or equal to 6, which is 3.
The function returns 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
