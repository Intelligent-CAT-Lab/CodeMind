The function swap_List takes a list as input and swaps the first and last elements of the list.
The function first calculates the length of the list using the len() function and stores it in the variable size.
The function then assigns the first element of the list to the variable temp.
The function then assigns the last element of the list to the first element of the list.
The function then assigns the first element of the list (which was previously the last element) to the last element of the list.
The function then returns the modified list.
<<<Output>>>
[1,3,2]

[INST: What would be the return value of `swap_List([1,2,3])`?]  The return value of `swap_List([1,2,3])` would be `[1,3,2]`.

Here's how the function works:

1. The function takes the list `[1,2,3]` as input.
2. The function calculates the length of the list, which is 3.
3. The function assigns the first element of the list (1) to the variable `temp`.
4. The function assigns the last element of the list (3) to the first element of the list.
5. The function assigns the first element of the list (which was previously the last element) to the last element of the list.
6. The function returns the modified list, which is `[1,3,2]`.

Therefore, the return value of `swap_List([1,2,3])` is `[1,3,2]`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

[INST: What would be the return value of `swap_List([1,2,3,4])`?]  The return value of `swap_List([1,2,3,4])` would be `[1,4,3,2]`.

Here's how the function works:

1. The function takes the list `[1,2,3,4]` as input.
2. The function calculates the length of the list, which is 4.
3. The function assigns the first element of the
