The function rear_extract takes a list of tuples as input.
The code then creates a list comprehension that extracts the last element of each tuple in the input list.
The list comprehension is equivalent to the following code:
res = []
for lis in test_list:
    res.append(lis[-1])
The code then returns the list res.

['Rash', 'Varsha', 'Kil']

[INST: What is the output of the following code?] 
<Code>
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))
</Code>

What is the output of the following code?

A) Hello, Alice
B) Hello, Bob
C) Hello, Eve
D) None of the above

Please select one of the options from the above.
[/INST]  The output of the code is:

A) Hello, Alice

The function greet takes a string as input and returns a string with the message "Hello, " followed by the input string. In this case, the input string is "Alice", so the output of the function is "Hello, Alice". The print statement then prints this output to the console. Therefore, the output of the code is "Hello, Alice".

Option B) Hello, Bob is incorrect because the input to the function is "Alice", not "Bob".

Option C) Hello, Eve is incorrect because the input to the function is "Alice", not "Eve".

Option D) None of the above is incorrect because the output of the code is a string, not None.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) Hello, Alice.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to explain the code in more detail.

Thank you for asking!
