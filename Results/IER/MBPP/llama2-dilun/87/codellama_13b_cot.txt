<<<Analysis>>>
The function merge_dictionaries_three takes three dictionaries as input and returns a merged dictionary.
The function first imports the collections module as ct and uses it to create a ChainMap object.
The ChainMap object is initialized with an empty dictionary as the first argument, followed by the three input dictionaries.
The merged dictionary is then created by calling the dict() function on the ChainMap object.
The dict() function returns a new dictionary with the same key-value pairs as the ChainMap object.
The function then returns the merged dictionary.

The input to the function is three dictionaries:
{ "R": "Red", "B": "Black", "P": "Pink" }
{ "G": "Green", "W": "White" }
{ "O": "Orange", "W": "White", "B": "Black" }

The merged dictionary will have the following key-value pairs:
{ "R": "Red", "B": "Black", "P": "Pink", "G": "Green", "W": "White", "O": "Orange" }

The return value of the function will be the merged dictionary:
{ "R": "Red", "B": "Black", "P": "Pink", "G": "Green", "W": "White", "O": "Orange" }
<<<Output>>>
{ "R": "Red", "B": "Black", "P": "Pink", "G": "Green", "W": "White", "O": "Orange" }
