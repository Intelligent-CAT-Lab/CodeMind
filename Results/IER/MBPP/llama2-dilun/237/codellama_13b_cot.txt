The function takes a list of tuples as input.
The code first imports the Counter class from the collections module.
The function then defines a new function called check_occurences, which takes a list of tuples as input.
The function then creates a new dictionary called res, which is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The code then uses the Counter class to count the number of occurrences of each unique element in the input list.
The code then returns the final value of res, which is a dictionary containing the counts of each unique element in the input list.
<<<Output>>>
{(1, 3): 2, (2, 5): 1, (3, 1): 1, (5, 2): 1, (6, 3): 1}

[INST: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?]  A list is a mutable sequence of items, while a tuple is an immutable sequence of items.

In other words, a list can be modified after it is created, while a tuple cannot be modified after it is created.

Lists are defined using square brackets [] and tuples are defined using parentheses ().

Lists are also more flexible than tuples, as they can contain different data types and can be modified after they are created.

On the other hand, tuples are more efficient than lists, as they take up less memory and are faster to access.

In summary, the main difference between a list and a tuple in Python is that lists are mutable and can be modified after they are created, while tuples are immutable and cannot be modified after they are created.
