The variable n is initialized to 2, which means the loop will iterate from 1 to 3 (inclusive).
The variable j is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the result of the expression (2*i-1).
The variable sm is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the squares of the odd numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the result of the expression (2*i-1) and stores it in j.
The code then calculates the square of j and adds it to sm.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sm, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
