The variable num is initialized to 99.
The code imports the sys module, which provides access to the maximum value that can be stored in a variable.
The function next_smallest_palindrome takes a single argument, num, and returns the next smallest palindrome greater than num.
The code converts num to a string and stores it in numstr.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from num+1 to sys.maxsize (the maximum value that can be stored in a variable).
For each number i in this range, the code checks if str(i) is equal to str(i)[::-1], which is the same string but reversed.
If the condition is met, the function returns i, which is the next smallest palindrome greater than num.
The loop continues until the condition is met or the maximum value of sys.maxsize is reached.

The function greet takes a single argument, name, and returns a string that says "Hello, " followed by the name and an exclamation mark.
The code calls the function greet with the argument "Alice" and stores the return value in a variable called print.
The code then prints the value of print.
<<<Output>>>
Hello, Alice!
