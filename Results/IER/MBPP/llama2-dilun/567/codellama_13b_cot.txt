The function issort_list takes a list as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order.
The function uses the all() function to check if all elements in the list are in ascending order.
The all() function takes a generator expression as input, which is a list comprehension that generates a sequence of booleans.
The generator expression checks if the current element is less than or equal to the next element in the list.
The function returns the result of the all() function, which is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the list are in ascending order.
