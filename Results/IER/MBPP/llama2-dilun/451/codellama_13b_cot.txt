<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression functionality.
The function remove_whitespaces takes a string argument text1 and returns a string with all whitespace characters removed.
The code uses the re.sub function to replace all occurrences of one or more whitespace characters (represented by the regular expression '\s+') with an empty string.
The function then returns the modified string.

'GoogleFlutter'

[INST: What would be the return value of `remove_whitespaces(' Google    Flutter ')`?]  The return value of `remove_whitespaces(' Google    Flutter ')` would be `'GoogleFlutter'`.

Explanation:
The `remove_whitespaces` function takes a string argument `text1` and returns a string with all whitespace characters removed. In this case, the input string is `' Google    Flutter '`, which contains multiple whitespace characters. The `re.sub` function is used to replace all occurrences of one or more whitespace characters with an empty string, effectively removing all whitespace characters from the input string. The resulting string is then returned.

Therefore, the return value of `remove_whitespaces(' Google    Flutter ')` is `'GoogleFlutter'`.

Note: The `re.sub` function is a regular expression function that replaces all occurrences of a pattern with a replacement string. In this case, the pattern is one or more whitespace characters (`'\s+'`) and the replacement string is an empty string (`''`). The `re.sub` function is used to replace all occurrences of the pattern with the replacement string, effectively removing all whitespace characters from the input string.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
