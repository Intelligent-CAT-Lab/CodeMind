<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: test_list and N.
test_list is a list of lists, and N is an integer.
The function first creates a list comprehension that selects the Nth element from each sublist in test_list.
The list comprehension is then passed to the max function to find the maximum value.
The maximum value is then returned.

In this case, the list comprehension will select the 2nd element from each sublist, which are 6, 3, and 9.
The maximum value of these elements is 9.

<<<Output>>>
9
