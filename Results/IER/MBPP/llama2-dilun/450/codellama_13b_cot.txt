The variable str is initialized to ['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice','solution'].
The variable l is initialized to 8.
The code then enters a list comprehension that iterates over the elements of str.
For each element e in str, the code checks if the length of e is equal to l. If it is, it adds e to the result list.
The result list will contain all the elements of str that have a length of 8.
Since there are no elements in str with a length of 8, the result list will be empty.
