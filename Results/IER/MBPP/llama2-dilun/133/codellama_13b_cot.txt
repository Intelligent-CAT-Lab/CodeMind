The function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns the sum of all negative numbers in the list.
The code first creates a new list called sum_negativenum by filtering the input list nums to only include negative numbers.
The filter function uses a lambda function to check if each number in nums is less than 0.
The return value of the filter function is a new list containing only negative numbers.
The code then uses the sum function to calculate the sum of all numbers in the new list.
The return value of the sum function is the sum of all negative numbers in the input list.
