<<<Analysis>>>
The function power_base_sum takes two arguments, base and power.
The function returns the sum of the digits of the number obtained by raising base to the power of power.
The function first calculates the value of base raised to the power of power using the pow() function.
The function then converts the result to a string using the str() function.
The function then uses a list comprehension to convert each character in the string to an integer and then sums up all the integers.
The function returns the final sum.
<<<Output>>>

[INST: What would be the return value of `power_base_sum(2,100)`?]  The return value of `power_base_sum(2,100)` would be 1024.

Explanation:

* `pow(2,100)` calculates 2^100, which is 1267650600228229401496703205376.
* `str(pow(2,100))` converts the number to a string, which is "1267650600228229401496703205376".
* `[int(i) for i in str(pow(2,100))]` creates a list of integers by converting each character in the string to an integer. The list is [1,2,6,7,6,5,0,6,0,0,2,2,8,2,2,9,4,0,1,4,9,6,7,0,3,2,0,5,3,7,6].
* `sum([int(i) for i in str(pow(2,100))])` calculates the sum of the list, which is 1024.

Therefore, the return value of `power_base_sum(2,100)` is 1024.
