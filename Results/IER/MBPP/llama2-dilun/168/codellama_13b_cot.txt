The function frequency takes two arguments, a list a and an integer x.
The function first initializes a variable count to 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the list a.
For each element i in the list, the function checks if i is equal to x.
If i is equal to x, the function increments the variable count by 1.
The function then returns the value of count.

In this case, the list a is [1,2,3] and the integer x is 4.
The function will iterate over the elements of the list and find that none of them are equal to 4.
Therefore, the function will return 0.

In this case, the list a is [1,2,3] and the integer x is 3.
The function will iterate over the elements of the list and find that the third element is equal to 3.
Therefore, the function will return 1.
