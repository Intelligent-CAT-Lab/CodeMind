<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of strings as input, which are assumed to be numeric strings.
The function first converts each string to an integer using the int() function.
The resulting list of integers is then sorted using the sort() method.
The sorted list of integers is then returned as the output.

The input list is ['4','12','45','7','0','100','200','-12','-500'].
The output list is [-500, -12, 0, 4, 7, 12, 45, 100, 200].
<<<Output>>>
[-500, -12, 0, 4, 7, 12, 45, 100, 200]
