<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression functionality.
The function find_adverb_position takes a string argument text and returns a tuple containing the start and end positions of the first occurrence of the pattern "\w+ly" in the text, along with the matched string itself.
The code uses the re.finditer function to find all occurrences of the pattern in the text.
The loop iterates over the matches, and the first match is returned as a tuple containing the start and end positions of the match, along with the matched string.
