The function Find_Max_Length takes a list of lists as input.
The code first calculates the maximum length of the sublists in the input list using the max function.
The max function takes an iterable of numbers and returns the largest number in the iterable.
In this case, the iterable is the list of lengths of the sublists in the input list.
The code then returns the maximum length.

[INST: What would be the return value of `Find_Max_Length([[1],[1,4],[5,6,7,8]])`?]  The return value of `Find_Max_Length([[1],[1,4],[5,6,7,8]])` would be 4.

Explanation:

* The input list is `[[1],[1,4],[5,6,7,8]]`.
* The sublists in the input list are `[1]`, `[1,4]`, and `[5,6,7,8]`.
* The length of each sublist is calculated as follows:
	+ The length of `[1]` is 1.
	+ The length of `[1,4]` is 2.
	+ The length of `[5,6,7,8]` is 4.
* The maximum length of the sublists is 4, which is the return value of the function.

Therefore, the return value of `Find_Max_Length([[1],[1,4],[5,6,7,8]])` is 4.
