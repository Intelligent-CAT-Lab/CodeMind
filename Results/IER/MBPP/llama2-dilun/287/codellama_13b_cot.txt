The variable n is initialized to 2, which will be used to calculate the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n.
The code then calculates the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n using the formula 2*n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)/3.
The formula is derived from the fact that the sum of squares of consecutive numbers is equal to the square of the sum of the first and last numbers.
In this case, the first and last numbers are 1 and 2*n, respectively.
The formula simplifies to 2*n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)/3.
The code then returns the result of this calculation, which is 12.
