The function takes two arguments: str1, which is a list of strings, and sub_str, which is a string.
The function checks if any of the strings in str1 contains the substring sub_str.
The code uses the any() function to check if any of the strings in str1 contains the substring sub_str.
The any() function returns True if any of the strings in str1 contains the substring sub_str, and False otherwise.
The code then returns the value of the any() function.
