The function get_coordinates takes a tuple as input and returns a list of lists.
The function adjac takes a tuple and an optional list as input and returns a list of lists.
The function adjac recursively calls itself with the first element of the input tuple removed and the optional list updated with the first element of the input tuple.
The function adjac also generates a list of lists by iterating over the range of the first element of the input tuple and adding the current element to the optional list.
The function get_coordinates calls the function adjac with the input tuple and an empty list as the optional list.
The function adjac returns a list of lists with the first element of the input tuple removed and the optional list updated with the first element of the input tuple.
The function get_coordinates returns the list of lists generated by the function adjac.
