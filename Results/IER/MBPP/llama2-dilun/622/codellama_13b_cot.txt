<<<Analysis>>>
The function get_median takes three arguments: arr1, arr2, and n.
The function first initializes four variables: i, j, m1, and m2.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates until the count variable reaches n + 1.
The loop first increments the count variable by 1.
The loop then checks if i is equal to n. If it is, the loop breaks and sets m1 to m2 and m2 to the first element of arr2.
The loop then checks if j is equal to n. If it is, the loop breaks and sets m1 to m2 and m2 to the first element of arr1.
If neither i nor j is equal to n, the loop checks if the element at index i in arr1 is less than or equal to the element at index j in arr2. If it is, the loop sets m1 to m2, m2 to the element at index i in arr1, and increments i by 1.
If the element at index i in arr1 is greater than the element at index j in arr2, the loop sets m1 to m2, m2 to the element at index j in arr2, and increments j by 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the average of m1 and m2.
