The variable l is initialized to 3, which is the input to the function.
The code then calculates the volume of a cube with side length l, which is 3 in this case.
The volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying the side length by itself three times, which is 3 * 3 * 3 = 27.
The code then returns the volume, which is 27.
<<<Output>>>
27

The variable l is initialized to 5, which is the input to the function.
The code then calculates the volume of a cube with side length l, which is 5 in this case.
The volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying the side length by itself three times, which is 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.
The code then returns the volume, which is 125.

The variable l is initialized to 10, which is the input to the function.
The code then calculates the volume of a cube with side length l, which is 10 in this case.
The volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying the side length by itself three times, which is 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000.
The code then returns the volume, which is 1000.
