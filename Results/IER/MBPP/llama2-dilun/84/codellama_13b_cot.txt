The function sequence takes an integer n as input and returns an integer.
The function first checks if n is equal to 1 or 2, and if so, it returns 1.
If n is not equal to 1 or 2, the function calls itself recursively with the argument n-1.
The function then adds the result of the recursive call to the result of another recursive call with the argument n-sequence(n-1).
The function sequence(n-1) is calculated by calling the function sequence recursively with the argument n-1.
The function sequence(n-sequence(n-1)) is calculated by calling the function sequence recursively with the argument n-sequence(n-1).
The function returns the sum of the two recursive calls.

The function sequence(10) will call itself recursively with the argument 10-1, which is 9.
The function sequence(9) will call itself recursively with the argument 9-1, which is 8.
The function sequence(8) will call itself recursively with the argument 8-1, which is 7.
The function sequence(7) will call itself recursively with the argument 7-1, which is 6.
The function sequence(6) will call itself recursively with the argument 6-1, which is 5.
The function sequence(5) will call itself recursively with the argument 5-1, which is 4.
The function sequence(4) will call itself recursively with the argument 4-1, which is 3.
The function sequence(3) will call itself recursively with the argument 3-1, which is 2.
The function sequence(2) will call itself recursively with the argument 2-1, which is 1.
The function sequence(1) will return 1.
The function sequence(2) will return 1.
The function sequence(3) will return 1.
The function sequence(4) will return 1.
The function sequence(5) will return 1.
The function sequence(6) will return 1.
The function sequence(7) will return 1.
The function sequence(8) will return 1.
The function sequence(9) will return 1.
