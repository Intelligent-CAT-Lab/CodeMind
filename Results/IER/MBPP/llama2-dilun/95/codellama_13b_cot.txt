<<<Analysis>>>
The function Find_Min_Length takes a list of lists as input.
The code first calculates the minimum length of all the lists in the input list using the min function.
The min function takes an iterable of numbers and returns the smallest number in the iterable.
In this case, the iterable is the list of lengths of all the lists in the input list.
The code then returns the minimum length.

[INST: What would be the return value of `Find_Min_Length([[1,2,3],[1,2,3,4]])`?] 

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
