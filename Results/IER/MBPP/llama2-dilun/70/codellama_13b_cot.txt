<<<Analysis>>>
The function get_equal takes a list of tuples as input.
The function find_equal_tuple checks if all the tuples in the list have the same length.
The function returns 1 if all the tuples have the same length, and 0 otherwise.
The function get_equal returns the value returned by find_equal_tuple.

In this case, the input is a list of two tuples: [(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)].
The function find_equal_tuple checks if all the tuples in the list have the same length.
The first tuple has length 3, and the second tuple has length 3, so the function returns 1.
The function get_equal returns the value returned by find_equal_tuple, which is 1.
