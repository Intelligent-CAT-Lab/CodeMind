<<<Analysis>>>
The function add_tuple takes two arguments: test_list and test_tup.
test_list is a list of integers, and test_tup is a tuple of integers.
The function adds the elements of test_tup to test_list and returns the updated list.

In this case, test_list is [5, 6, 7], and test_tup is (9, 10).
The function adds the elements of test_tup to test_list, resulting in [5, 6, 7, 9, 10].
The updated list is returned.
<<<Output>>>
[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
