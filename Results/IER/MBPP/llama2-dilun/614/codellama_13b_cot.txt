The function cummulative_sum takes a list of tuples as input.
The code first maps the sum function to each tuple in the list, which calculates the sum of each tuple.
The resulting list of sums is then passed to the sum function, which calculates the cumulative sum of the list.
The final result is returned.

In this case, the input list is [(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)].
The sum of each tuple is calculated as follows:

* (1, 3) -> 4
* (5, 6, 7) -> 18
* (2, 6) -> 8

The cumulative sum of the list is then calculated as follows:

* 4 + 18 + 8 = 30

The final output is 30.

[INST: What is the output of the following code?]
<Code>
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"

print(greet("Alice"))
</Code>

What is the output of the above code?

A) Hello, Alice!
B) Hello, Bob!
C) Hello, Eve!
D) None of the above

Please select one of the options from the above.
[/INST]  A) Hello, Alice!

The output of the code is "Hello, Alice!", which is the return value of the function greet("Alice"). The function greet takes a string as input and returns a string with the greeting message. In this case, the input is "Alice", so the output is "Hello, Alice!".

Therefore, the correct answer is A) Hello, Alice!

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to explain the code in more detail.
