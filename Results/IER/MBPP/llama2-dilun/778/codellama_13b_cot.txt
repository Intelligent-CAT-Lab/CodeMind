The function pack_consecutive_duplicates takes a list as input and returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains consecutive duplicates of the input list.
The function uses the itertools.groupby function to group the input list into consecutive duplicates.
The groupby function takes two arguments: the first is the input list, and the second is a function that defines how to group the elements of the list. In this case, the function is lambda x: x, which means that the elements of the list are grouped based on their value.
The return value of the function is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first is the key used to group the elements, and the second is an iterator over the elements in the group.
The function then uses a list comprehension to create a new list of lists, where each sublist contains the elements of the group.
<<<Output>>>
[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]

[INST: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?]  A list is a mutable sequence of items, while a tuple is an immutable sequence of items.

In Python, a list is a collection of items that can be modified after it is created. Lists are defined using square brackets [] and can contain items of any data type, including other lists.

On the other hand, a tuple is a collection of items that cannot be modified after it is created. Tuples are defined using parentheses () and can also contain items of any data type, including other tuples.

One key difference between lists and tuples is that tuples are faster and more efficient than lists. This is because tuples are immutable, which means that they cannot be changed after they are created. This means that Python does not have to worry about keeping track of changes to the tuple, which makes it faster and more efficient.

Another difference between lists and tuples is that tuples can be used as dictionary keys, while lists cannot. This is because lists are mutable, which means that they can be changed after they are created. This makes it difficult to keep track of changes to the list,
