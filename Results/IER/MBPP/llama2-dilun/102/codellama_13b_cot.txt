The function takes a string argument 'word' and returns a string.
The function imports the re module, which is used for regular expression operations.
The function then splits the input string 'word' into a list of substrings using the '_' character as a delimiter.
The function then iterates over the list of substrings and applies the capitalize() method to each substring.
If the substring is empty, the function adds an underscore ('_') to the output string.
Finally, the function joins the list of substrings into a single string and returns it.
