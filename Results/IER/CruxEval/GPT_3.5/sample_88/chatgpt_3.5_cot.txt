<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings s1 and s2 as input. It checks if s2 ends with s1 using the endswith() method. If it does, it removes the last len(s1) characters from s2 using slicing. Finally, it returns the modified s2.

In this case, s1 is "he" and s2 is "hello". Since "hello" ends with "he", the if condition is True. Therefore, the last two characters "he" are removed from s2. The modified s2 becomes "llo".

Therefore, the return value of f("he", "hello") is "llo".
<<<Output>>>
'llo'
