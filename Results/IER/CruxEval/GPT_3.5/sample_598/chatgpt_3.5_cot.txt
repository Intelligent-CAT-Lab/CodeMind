<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a string text and an integer n. 
First, it calculates the length of the string text and assigns it to the variable length. 
Then, it returns a slice of the string text, starting from the index length*(n%4) and ending at the index length.

In this case, the input is 'abc' and 1. 
The length of the string 'abc' is 3. 
The value of n%4 is 1%4 = 1. 
So, the starting index of the slice will be 3*1 = 3. 
Since the ending index is not specified, it will default to the length of the string, which is 3. 

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'abc' and 1 is 'c'.
<<<Output>>>
'c'
