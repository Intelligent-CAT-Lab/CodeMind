The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input. It iterates over the indices of the list using the range(len(nums)) function. For each index i, it inserts the square of the number at that index (nums[i]**2) at the same index i. This effectively doubles the length of the list and shifts all the elements after index i to the right. Finally, it returns the modified list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 4], we need to analyze the code step by step:
1. The initial list is [1, 2, 4].
2. The loop starts with i = 0. It inserts the square of the number at index 0 (1**2 = 1) at index 0. The list becomes [1, 1, 2, 4].
3. The loop continues with i = 1. It inserts the square of the number at index 1 (1**2 = 1) at index 1. The list becomes [1, 1, 1, 2, 4].
4. The loop continues with i = 2. It inserts the square of the number at index 2 (2**2 = 4) at index 2. The list becomes [1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4].
5. The loop ends because there are no more indices to iterate over.
6. The final list is [1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 4] is [1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4].

[1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4]
