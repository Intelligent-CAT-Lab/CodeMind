<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a string and a separator. 
First, it counts the number of occurrences of the separator in the string and assigns it to the variable cnt.
Then, it concatenates the string and the separator cnt times and assigns it to a new string.
Finally, it reverses the new string and returns it as the output.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'caabcfcabfc' and 'ab', we need to follow these steps:
1. Count the number of occurrences of 'ab' in 'caabcfcabfc'. There are 2 occurrences.
2. Concatenate 'caabcfcabfc' and 'ab' 2 times. The result is 'caabcfcabfcabab'.
3. Reverse the string 'caabcfcabfcabab'. The result is 'babaabcfbacfbaac'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'caabcfcabfc' and 'ab' is 'babaabcfbacfbaac'.
<<<Output>>>
'babaabcfbacfbaac'
