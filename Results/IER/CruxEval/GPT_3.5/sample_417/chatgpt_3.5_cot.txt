<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and performs the following steps:
1. Reverse the order of the elements in the list using the reverse() method.
2. Remove the last element from the list using the pop() method.
3. Reverse the order of the elements in the list again using the reverse() method.
4. Return the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 8, 2, 8], we need to follow these steps:
1. Reverse the list [7, 8, 2, 8] to get [8, 2, 8, 7].
2. Remove the last element from the list [8, 2, 8, 7] to get [8, 2, 8].
3. Reverse the list [8, 2, 8] to get [8, 2, 8].
4. Return the modified list [8, 2, 8].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 8, 2, 8] is [8, 2, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[8, 2, 8]
