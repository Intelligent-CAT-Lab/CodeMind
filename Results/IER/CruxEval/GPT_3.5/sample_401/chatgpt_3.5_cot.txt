<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and suffix. It checks if the suffix is not empty and if the text ends with the suffix. If both conditions are true, it returns the text without the suffix. Otherwise, it returns the original text.
In this case, the suffix is 'example' and the text is 'mathematics'. Since the text does not end with the suffix, the function will return the original text, which is 'mathematics'.
<<<Output>>>
'mathematics'
