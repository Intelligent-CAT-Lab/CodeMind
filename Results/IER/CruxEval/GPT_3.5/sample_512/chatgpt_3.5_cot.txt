<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and checks if the length of s is equal to the sum of the counts of '0' and '1' in s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '102', we need to count the occurrences of '0' and '1' in '102' and check if the sum is equal to the length of '102'.
The count of '0' in '102' is 1 and the count of '1' in '102' is 1. The length of '102' is 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '102' is False.
<<<Output>>>
False
