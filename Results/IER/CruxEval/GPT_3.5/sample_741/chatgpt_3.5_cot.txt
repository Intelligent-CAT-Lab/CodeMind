<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums and an integer p as input. It first calculates the value of prev_p by subtracting 1 from p. If prev_p is less than 0, it is set to the last index of the nums list. Finally, the function returns the element at the index prev_p in the nums list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7] and 6, we need to follow these steps:
1. Calculate prev_p by subtracting 1 from p: prev_p = 6 - 1 = 5.
2. Since prev_p is not less than 0, it remains 5.
3. Return the element at index 5 in the nums list: nums[5] = 1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7] and 6 is 1.
