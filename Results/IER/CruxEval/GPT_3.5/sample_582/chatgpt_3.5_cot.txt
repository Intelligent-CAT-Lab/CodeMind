<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two integers k and j as input. It initializes an empty list arr. Then, it iterates over the range from 0 to k-1 and appends the value of j to the list arr in each iteration. Finally, it returns the list arr.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (7, 5), we need to iterate 7 times and append the value 5 to the list arr in each iteration. Therefore, the list arr will contain 7 elements, all of which are 5.
<<<Output>>>
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
