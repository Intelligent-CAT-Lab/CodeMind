<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input. 
The line `nums[:] = nums[::-1]` reverses the order of the elements in the list nums by using slicing and assignment. 
The line `return nums` returns the reversed list nums as the output of the function.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-6, -2, 1, -3, 0, 1], we need to reverse the order of the elements in the list. 
The reversed list would be [1, 0, -3, 1, -2, -6].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-6, -2, 1, -3, 0, 1] is [1, 0, -3, 1, -2, -6].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 0, -3, 1, -2, -6]
