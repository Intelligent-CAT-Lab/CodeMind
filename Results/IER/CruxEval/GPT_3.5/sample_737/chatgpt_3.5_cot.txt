<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input and initializes a variable counts to 0. 
Then, it iterates over each element i in the list nums. 
Inside the loop, it checks if the string representation of i is a decimal using the isdecimal() method. 
If it is a decimal, it checks if counts is equal to 0. 
If counts is 0, it increments counts by 1. 
Finally, it returns the value of counts.

In the given input [0, 6, 2, -1, -2], the function will iterate over each element and check if it is a decimal. 
Since all the elements in the list are integers, they are considered decimals. 
However, the condition to increment counts is only satisfied when counts is 0. 
Therefore, the function will only increment counts once, resulting in a return value of 1.
