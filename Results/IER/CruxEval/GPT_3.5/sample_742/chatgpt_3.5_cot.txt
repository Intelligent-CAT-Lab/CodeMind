<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a boolean value. 
The function iterates over each character in the input string. 
If the character is a digit, the boolean variable b is set to True. 
If the character is not a digit, the boolean variable b is set to False and the loop is terminated using the break statement. 
Finally, the function returns the value of b.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "-1-3", we need to analyze the steps:
1. The first character is "-", which is not a digit. Therefore, b is set to False and the loop is terminated.
2. The function returns the value of b, which is False.

<<<Output>>>
False
