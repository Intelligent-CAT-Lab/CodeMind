<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a string s and a character c. 
First, the function splits the string s into a list of words using the space as a delimiter. 
Then, it reverses the order of the words in the list using the slicing notation s[::-1]. 
Next, it joins the reversed list of words using the delimiter "  ".
Finally, it concatenates the character c with two spaces, and then concatenates the result with the joined string of reversed words.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'Hello There' and '*' is '*  There  Hello'.
<<<Output>>>
'*  There  Hello'
