<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input and returns the element at the middle index of the list. 
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, -3, -5, -7, 0], we need to find the middle index of the list, which is len(nums)//2. In this case, len(nums) is 5, so len(nums)//2 is 2. 
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, -3, -5, -7, 0] is -5.
<<<Output>>>
-5
