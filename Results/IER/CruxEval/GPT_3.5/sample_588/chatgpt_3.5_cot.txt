<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: items (a list) and target (a string). 
The function checks if the target string is present in the items list. 
If it is present, the function returns the index of the target string in the items list. 
If it is not present, the function returns -1.

In this case, the items list is ['1', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+'] and the target string is '**'.
The function checks if '**' is present in the items list. It is present at index 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input is 3.
