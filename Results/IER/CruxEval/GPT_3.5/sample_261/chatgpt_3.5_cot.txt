<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums and a target number as input. It initializes two empty lists, lows and higgs. Then, it iterates over each number i in nums. If i is less than the target, it appends i to the lows list. Otherwise, it appends i to the higgs list. After the loop, it clears the lows list and returns both lows and higgs lists as a tuple.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51] and 5, we need to analyze the code step by step:
1. Initialize lows as an empty list and higgs as an empty list.
2. Iterate over each number i in [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51].
   - i = 12: 12 is not less than 5, so append 12 to higgs.
   - i = 516: 516 is not less than 5, so append 516 to higgs.
   - i = 5: 5 is equal to the target, so append 5 to higgs.
   - i = 2: 2 is less than 5, so append 2 to lows.
   - i = 3: 3 is less than 5, so append 3 to lows.
   - i = 214: 214 is not less than 5, so append 214 to higgs.
   - i = 51: 51 is not less than 5, so append 51 to higgs.
3. Clear the lows list.
4. Return the tuple (lows, higgs), which is ([], [12, 516, 5, 214, 51]).

<<<Output>>>
([], [12, 516, 5, 214, 51])
