<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: an integer and a number n. It converts the integer to a string and assigns it to the variable text. Then, it enters a while loop that continues as long as the sum of i and the length of text is less than n. Inside the loop, i is incremented by the length of text. Finally, the function returns the string text padded with zeros on the left to make its length equal to i + the length of text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (8999, 2), we need to analyze the code step by step:
1. The integer is converted to a string, so text = "8999".
2. The initial value of i is 1.
3. The while loop condition is checked: i + len(text) = 1 + 4 = 5 < 2. Since the condition is False, the loop is not executed.
4. The function returns text.zfill(i + len(text)) = "8999".zfill(1 + 4) = "08999".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (8999, 2) is "08999".
