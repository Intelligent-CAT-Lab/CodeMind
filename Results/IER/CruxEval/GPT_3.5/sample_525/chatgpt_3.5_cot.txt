The function f takes three inputs: a dictionary c, and two integers st and ed. It initializes an empty dictionary d, and two variables a and b to 0. 

The function then iterates over the items in the dictionary c. For each key-value pair (x, y), it adds an entry to the dictionary d with the value y as the key and the value x as the value. 

If the value y is equal to the input st, it assigns the value x to the variable a. If the value y is equal to the input ed, it assigns the value x to the variable b. 

Finally, it retrieves the value associated with the key st from the dictionary d and assigns it to the variable w. 

The function then returns a tuple (w, b) if a is greater than b, otherwise it returns a tuple (b, w).

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'TEXT': 7, 'CODE': 3}, 7, 3, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize the dictionary d as an empty dictionary.
2. Initialize the variables a and b to 0.
3. Iterate over the items in the dictionary c:
   - For the first item ('TEXT', 7), add an entry to d with key 7 and value 'TEXT'.
   - For the second item ('CODE', 3), add an entry to d with key 3 and value 'CODE'.
   - Since 7 is equal to st, assign the value 'TEXT' to a.
   - Since 3 is equal to ed, assign the value 'CODE' to b.
4. Retrieve the value associated with the key st (7) from the dictionary d and assign it to w.
5. Since a (7) is greater than b (3), return the tuple (w, b), which is ('TEXT', 'CODE').

('TEXT', 'CODE')
