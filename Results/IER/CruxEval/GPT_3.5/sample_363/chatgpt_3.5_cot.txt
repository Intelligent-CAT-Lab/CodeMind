The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input and performs the following steps:
1. Sorts the list nums in ascending order.
2. Calculates the length of the sorted list and assigns it to the variable n.
3. Creates a new list new_nums with the middle element of the sorted list as its only element.
4. If the length of the sorted list is even (n % 2 == 0), updates new_nums to contain the two middle elements of the sorted list.
5. Iterates over the first half of the sorted list (range(0, n//2)) and performs the following operations:
   - Inserts the i-th element from the end of the sorted list at the beginning of new_nums.
   - Appends the i-th element from the beginning of the sorted list at the end of new_nums.
6. Returns the final new_nums list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1], we need to follow these steps:
1. Sort the list [1], which results in [1].
2. Calculate the length of the sorted list, which is 1.
3. Create a new list new_nums with the middle element of the sorted list [1], which is [1].
4. Since the length of the sorted list is not even, there is no need to update new_nums.
5. There are no elements in the first half of the sorted list, so no elements will be inserted or appended to new_nums.
6. Return the final new_nums list, which is [1].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1] is [1].
