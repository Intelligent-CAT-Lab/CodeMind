<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two lists, arr1 and arr2, as input. It creates a new list, new_arr, by making a copy of arr1 using the copy() method. Then, it extends new_arr by adding all the elements of arr2 using the extend() method. Finally, it returns new_arr.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] and ['', 0, -1, []], we need to follow these steps:
1. Create a new list, new_arr, by making a copy of [5, 1, 3, 7, 8].
2. Extend new_arr by adding all the elements of ['', 0, -1, []].
3. Return new_arr.

Let's go through these steps:
1. The copy() method creates a new list with the same elements as [5, 1, 3, 7, 8]. So, new_arr becomes [5, 1, 3, 7, 8].
2. The extend() method adds all the elements of ['', 0, -1, []] to new_arr. So, new_arr becomes [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []].
3. Finally, new_arr is returned as the output.

<<<Output>>>
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]
