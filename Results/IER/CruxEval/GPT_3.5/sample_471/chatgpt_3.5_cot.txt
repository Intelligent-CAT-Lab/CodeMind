<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: val and text. It first creates a list called indices, which contains the indices of all occurrences of val in the text. It does this by iterating over the range of the length of the text and checking if the character at each index is equal to val. If it is, the index is added to the indices list.

Next, the function checks if the length of the indices list is 0. If it is, it means that val does not occur in the text, so the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the first element of the indices list.

In this case, we are calling the function f with val = 'o' and text = 'fnmart'. The function will iterate over the characters in the text and find that 'o' occurs at index 4. Therefore, the function will return 4.
