<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following steps:
1. It creates a list called nums by filtering out the numeric characters from the input text using the filter() function and the str.isnumeric() method.
2. It asserts that the length of the nums list is greater than 0. If this condition is not met, an AssertionError will be raised.
3. It returns the concatenation of all the elements in the nums list using the join() method.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '-123   \t+314', we need to follow these steps:
1. Filter out the numeric characters from the input text: ['-123', '314']
2. Assert that the length of the nums list is greater than 0. Since the length is 2, the assertion passes.
3. Concatenate all the elements in the nums list: '-123314'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '-123   \t+314' is '-123314'.
<<<Output>>>
'-123314'
