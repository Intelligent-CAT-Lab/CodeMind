<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a list of numbers `nums` and a target number `target`. 
The function first counts the number of occurrences of the target number in the list using the `count()` method.
Then it multiplies the count by 2 and returns the result.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1] and target 1, we need to count the number of occurrences of 1 in the list [1, 1], which is 2.
Then we multiply the count by 2, so the result is 2 * 2 = 4.

<<<Output>>>
4
