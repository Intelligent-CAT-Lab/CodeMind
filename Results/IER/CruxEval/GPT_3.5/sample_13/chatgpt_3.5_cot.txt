<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of names as input. It first calculates the total number of names in the list by using the len() function. Then, it initializes a variable numberOfNames to 0. It then iterates over each element in the names list and checks if the element is alphabetic using the isalpha() method. If the element is alphabetic, it increments the numberOfNames variable by 1. Finally, it returns the value of numberOfNames.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee'], we need to count the number of alphabetic names in the list. In this case, all three names are alphabetic. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee'] is 3.
