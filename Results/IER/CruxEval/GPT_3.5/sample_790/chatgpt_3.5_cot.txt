<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input and creates a new dictionary r with two keys 'c' and 'd'. The values of both keys are copies of the input dictionary d.
The function then returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The result of the expression r['c'] is r['d'], which checks if the two dictionaries are the same object.
2. The result of the expression r['c'] == r['d'], which checks if the two dictionaries have the same key-value pairs.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets'}, we need to evaluate the two expressions mentioned above.

1. The expression r['c'] is r['d'] checks if the two dictionaries are the same object. Since r['c'] and r['d'] are both copies of the input dictionary d, they are not the same object. Therefore, the result of this expression is False.

2. The expression r['c'] == r['d'] checks if the two dictionaries have the same key-value pairs. Since r['c'] and r['d'] are both copies of the input dictionary d, they have the same key-value pairs. Therefore, the result of this expression is True.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets'} is (False, True).
