<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string name as input and returns a list containing the first character of name and the last character of the second element of name.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "master. ", we need to extract the first character of "master. " and the last character of the second element of "master. ".
The first character of "master. " is "m".
The second element of "master. " is "a".
The last character of "a" is "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "master. " is ["m", "a"].
<<<Output>>>
['m', 'a']
