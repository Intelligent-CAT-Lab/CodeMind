<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and char. 
First, it checks if the text is not empty. If it is not empty, it performs the following steps:
1. It removes the prefix char from the text using the removeprefix() method.
2. It removes the prefix of the text which is the last character of the text using the removeprefix() method.
3. It replaces the last character of the text with its capitalized version using the capitalize() method.
Finally, it returns the modified text.

In this case, the input text is 'querist' and the input char is 'u'.
1. The removeprefix('u') method removes the prefix 'u' from the text, resulting in 'erist'.
2. The removeprefix('t') method removes the prefix 't' from the text, resulting in 'eris'.
3. The last character of the text is 's', so it is replaced with its capitalized version 'S', resulting in 'eriS'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'querist' and 'u' is 'eriS'.
<<<Output>>>
'eriS'
