<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: text, limit, and char. 
If the value of limit is less than the length of the text, the function returns the substring of text from index 0 to limit.
Otherwise, the function returns the text left-justified with a width of limit, using the character char to fill the remaining space.

In this case, the length of the text 'tqzym' is 5, which is equal to the limit. Therefore, the function will return the text left-justified with a width of 5, using the character 'c' to fill the remaining space.

The output of executing the function f on the input 'tqzym', 5, 'c' would be 'tqzym'.

<<<Output>>>
'tqzym'
