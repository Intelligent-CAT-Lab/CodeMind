<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: text, old, and new. It first checks if the length of old is greater than 3. If it is, it returns the original text without any modifications. 
Next, it checks if old is present in text and if there are no spaces in text. If both conditions are true, it replaces all occurrences of old in text with new repeated len(old) times and returns the modified text.
If the above conditions are not met, it enters a while loop and continues to replace all occurrences of old with new until there are no more occurrences left. Finally, it returns the modified text.

In this case, the input text is 'avacado', old is 'va', and new is '-'.
The length of old is 2, which is not greater than 3, so it proceeds to the next condition.
'va' is present in 'avacado' and there are no spaces, so it replaces 'va' with '-' repeated len('va') times, which is '-'.
The modified text becomes 'a-aco' and is returned as the output.

<<<Output>>>
'a-aco'
