<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer n as input and initializes an empty string called streak. 
Then, it iterates over each character c in the string representation of n.
For each character c, it appends c repeated twice (c.ljust(int(c) * 2)) to the streak string.
Finally, it returns the streak string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1, we need to go through the steps of the loop:
- The string representation of 1 is "1".
- The character "1" is appended to the streak string, resulting in streak = "1".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 is "1".
<<<Output>>>
'1'
