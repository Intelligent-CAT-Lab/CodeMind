The function f takes two inputs: base_list and nums. 
First, it extends the base_list with the elements of nums. 
Then, it creates a copy of base_list and assigns it to the variable res. 
Next, it enters a for loop that iterates over the range from -len(nums) to 0. 
Inside the loop, it appends the element at index i of res to res. 
Finally, it returns the modified res.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the given inputs, we need to follow these steps:
1. Extend the base_list [9, 7, 5, 3, 1] with the elements of nums [2, 4, 6, 8, 0]. The base_list becomes [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0].
2. Create a copy of the base_list and assign it to the variable res. The res becomes [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0].
3. Enter the for loop and iterate over the range from -5 to 0.
   - In the first iteration, i = -5. Append res[-5] (which is 1) to res. The res becomes [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 1].
   - In the second iteration, i = -4. Append res[-4] (which is 2) to res. The res becomes [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2].
   - In the third iteration, i = -3. Append res[-3] (which is 4) to res. The res becomes [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2, 4].
   - In the fourth iteration, i = -2. Append res[-2] (which is 6) to res. The res becomes [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6].
   - In the fifth iteration, i = -1. Append res[-1] (which is 8) to res. The res becomes [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8].
4. Return the modified res [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8].

<<<Output>>>
[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8]
