<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of values as input and sorts the list in ascending order using the sort() method. Then, it returns the sorted list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1, 1], we need to sort the list [1, 1, 1, 1] in ascending order.
After sorting, the list remains the same as all the elements are the same.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1, 1] is [1, 1, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 1]
