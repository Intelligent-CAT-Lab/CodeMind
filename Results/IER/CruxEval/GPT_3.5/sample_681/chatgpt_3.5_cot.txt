<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: an array, an index (ind), and an element (elem). It inserts the element at the specified index in the array using the insert() method. 

In this case, the input array is [1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3], the index is 2, and the element is 7. 

The insert() method is called with the index value of 2 + 1, which is 3, and the element 7. Therefore, the element 7 will be inserted at index 3 in the array. 

The resulting array will be [1, 5, 8, 7, 2, 0, 3]. 

Therefore, the return value of f([1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3], 2, 7) is [1, 5, 8, 7, 2, 0, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 8, 7, 2, 0, 3]
