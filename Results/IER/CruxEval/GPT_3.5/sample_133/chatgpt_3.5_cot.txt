<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two lists as input: nums and elements. It initializes an empty list called result. Then, it iterates over the indices of the elements list using the range function. For each index i, it appends the last element of the nums list to the result list using the pop method. Finally, it returns the modified nums list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2] and [9, 0, 3], we need to follow these steps:
1. Initialize the nums list as [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2] and the elements list as [9, 0, 3].
2. Iterate over the indices of the elements list: i = 0, 1, 2.
3. For i = 0, append the last element of the nums list (2) to the result list. The nums list becomes [7, 1, 2, 6, 0].
4. For i = 1, append the last element of the nums list (0) to the result list. The nums list becomes [7, 1, 2, 6].
5. For i = 2, append the last element of the nums list (6) to the result list. The nums list becomes [7, 1, 2].
6. Return the modified nums list: [7, 1, 2].

[7, 1, 2]
