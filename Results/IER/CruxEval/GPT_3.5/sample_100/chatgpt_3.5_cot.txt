<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a dictionary d and a list rm. It creates a new dictionary res by making a shallow copy of d. Then, it iterates over each element k in rm. If k is a key in res, it deletes the key-value pair from res. Finally, it returns the modified dictionary res.

In this case, the input dictionary is {'1': 'a', 1: 'a', 1: 'b', '1': 'b'} and the input list is [1]. 

The function starts by making a shallow copy of the dictionary, so res initially becomes {'1': 'b'}. Then, it iterates over each element in rm, which is [1]. The first element is 1. Since 1 is a key in res, the key-value pair (1, 'b') is deleted from res. After the iteration, res remains as {'1': 'b'}.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input is {'1': 'b'}.

{'1': 'b'}
