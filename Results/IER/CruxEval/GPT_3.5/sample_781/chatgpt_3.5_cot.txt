<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a string s and a character ch. 
The function first checks if the character ch is not present in the string s. If it is not present, the function returns an empty string.
If the character ch is present in the string s, the function proceeds to the next step.
The function uses the partition() method to split the string s into three parts: the part before the first occurrence of ch, the ch itself, and the part after the first occurrence of ch.
The function then reverses the third part of the split string using slicing with a step of -1.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the reversed third part of the split string.
In each iteration of the loop, the function again uses the partition() method to split the reversed third part of the string into three parts: the part before the first occurrence of ch, the ch itself, and the part after the first occurrence of ch.
The function then reverses the third part of the split string using slicing with a step of -1.
After the loop completes, the function returns the final value of the reversed third part of the split string.

In this case, the input string is 'shivajimonto6' and the character is '6'.
The character '6' is present in the string 'shivajimonto6'.
The function splits the string into three parts: 'shivaji', '6', and 'onto6'.
The third part is reversed to become '6otno'.
In the loop, the reversed third part is split into three parts: '6', 'o', and 'tno'.
The third part is reversed to become 'ont'.
In the next iteration of the loop, the reversed third part is split into three parts: 'o', 'n', and 't'.
The third part is reversed to become 't'.
Since there are no more iterations in the loop, the final value of the reversed third part is 't'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'shivajimonto6' and '6' is 't'.
<<<Output>>>
't'
