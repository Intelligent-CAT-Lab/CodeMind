<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: an array and an element. It checks if the element is present in the array using the `in` operator. If the element is present, it returns the index of the element in the array using the `index()` method. If the element is not present, it returns -1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 2, 7, 1] and 6, we need to check if 6 is present in the array. Since 6 is present at index 0, the function will return 0.

<<<Output>>>
0
