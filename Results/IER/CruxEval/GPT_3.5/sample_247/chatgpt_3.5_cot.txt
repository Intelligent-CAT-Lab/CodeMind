<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and checks if it consists only of alphabetic characters using the isalpha() method. If it does, it returns "yes". If the string is empty, it returns "str is empty". Otherwise, it returns "no".
In this case, the input is "Boolean". Since "Boolean" consists only of alphabetic characters, the first if condition is satisfied and the function returns "yes".
<<<Output>>>
'yes'
