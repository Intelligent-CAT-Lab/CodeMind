The function f takes a string text as input and initializes an empty list called chars. It then iterates over each character c in the input text. If the character c is a digit, it appends it to the chars list. Finally, it returns the reverse of the joined characters in the chars list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "--4yrw 251-//4 6p", we need to analyze each character in the input text:
- The first character '-' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the chars list.
- The second character '-' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the chars list.
- The third character '4' is a digit, so it is appended to the chars list.
- The fourth character 'y' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the chars list.
- The fifth character 'r' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the chars list.
- The sixth character 'w' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the chars list.
- The seventh character ' ' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the chars list.
- The eighth character '2' is a digit, so it is appended to the chars list.
- The ninth character '5' is a digit, so it is appended to the chars list.
- The tenth character '1' is a digit, so it is appended to the chars list.
- The eleventh character '-' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the chars list.
- The twelfth character '/' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the chars list.
- The thirteenth character '/' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the chars list.
- The fourteenth character '4' is a digit, so it is appended to the chars list.
- The fifteenth character ' ' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the chars list.
- The sixteenth character '6' is a digit, so it is appended to the chars list.
- The seventeenth character 'p' is not a digit, so it is not appended to the chars list.

After iterating over all the characters in the input text, the chars list contains the digits in reverse order: ['6', '4', '1', '5', '2', '4']. The function then joins these characters together in reverse order, resulting in the string '4215426'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "--4yrw 251-//4 6p" is '4215426'.
