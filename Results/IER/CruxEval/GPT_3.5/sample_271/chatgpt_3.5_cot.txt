<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and c. It first converts the text into a list of characters. Then, it checks if the character c is present in the text. If c is not present, it raises a ValueError with the message 'Text has no {c}'. Otherwise, it removes the last occurrence of c from the list of characters and returns the resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'uufhl' and 'l', we need to follow these steps:
1. Convert the text 'uufhl' into a list of characters: ['u', 'u', 'f', 'h', 'l'].
2. Check if 'l' is present in the text. It is present.
3. Remove the last occurrence of 'l' from the list of characters. The resulting list is ['u', 'u', 'f', 'h'].
4. Convert the list of characters back into a string. The resulting string is 'uufh'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'uufhl' and 'l' is 'uufh'.
