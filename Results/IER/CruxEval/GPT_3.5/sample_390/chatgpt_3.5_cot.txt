<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input. 
First, it checks if the stripped version of the text (i.e., text with leading and trailing whitespaces removed) is empty or not. 
If the stripped text is empty, it returns the length of the stripped text. 
Otherwise, it returns None.

In this case, the input " \t " is stripped to an empty string. 
Therefore, the function will return the length of the stripped text, which is 0.
