<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string st as input and checks if the first character of the string is '~'. If it is, it right justifies the string with 's' as the fill character and a width of 10, and then recursively calls itself with the modified string as the input. If the first character is not '~', it right justifies the string with 'n' as the fill character and a width of 10.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'eqe-;ew22', we need to analyze the steps:

1. The first character of the input string is 'e', which is not '~'. So, the function right justifies the string with 'n' as the fill character and a width of 10. The resulting string is 'eqe-;ew22'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'eqe-;ew22' is 'eqe-;ew22'.
<<<Output>>>
'eqe-;ew22'
