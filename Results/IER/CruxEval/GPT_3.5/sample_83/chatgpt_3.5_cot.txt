The function f takes a string text as input. It uses the rpartition() method to split the string into three parts: the part before the last occurrence of '0', the '0' itself, and the part after the '0'. 

If the part after the '0' is an empty string, it means there is no '0' in the input string. In this case, the function returns the string '-1:-1'.

Otherwise, the function returns a formatted string that consists of two parts:
1. The length of the part before the last occurrence of '0'.
2. The index of the first occurrence of '0' in the part after the last occurrence of '0', incremented by 1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'qq0tt', we need to analyze the steps:
1. The rpartition() method splits the string 'qq0tt' into ('qq', '0', 'tt').
2. Since the part after the '0' is not an empty string, the function proceeds to the next step.
3. The length of the part before the last occurrence of '0' is 2.
4. The index of the first occurrence of '0' in the part after the last occurrence of '0' is 0.
5. The index is incremented by 1, resulting in 1.
6. The function returns the formatted string '2:1'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'qq0tt' is '2:1'.

'2:1'
