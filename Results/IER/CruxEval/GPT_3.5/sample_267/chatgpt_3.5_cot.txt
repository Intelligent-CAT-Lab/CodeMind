<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and space. 
If the value of space is less than 0, the function returns the value of text.
Otherwise, the function returns the left-justified version of text, with a width equal to half the length of text plus the value of space.

In this case, the value of space is -7, which is less than 0. Therefore, the function will return the value of text, which is 'sowpf'.

<<<Output>>>
'sowpf'
