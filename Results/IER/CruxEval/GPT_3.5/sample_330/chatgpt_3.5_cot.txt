<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and initializes an empty list called ans.
Then, it iterates over each character in the input string.
If the character is a digit, it appends the character to the ans list.
Otherwise, it appends a space to the ans list.
Finally, it joins all the elements in the ans list into a single string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'm4n2o', we need to analyze each character in the input string:
- 'm' is not a digit, so a space is appended to the ans list.
- '4' is a digit, so '4' is appended to the ans list.
- 'n' is not a digit, so a space is appended to the ans list.
- '2' is a digit, so '2' is appended to the ans list.
- 'o' is not a digit, so a space is appended to the ans list.

Finally, the ans list is joined into a single string, resulting in ' 4 2 '.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'm4n2o' is ' 4 2 '.

' 4 2 '
