<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three inputs: n, m, and text. It first checks if the stripped version of text is an empty string. If it is, then it returns text as is. Otherwise, it proceeds to perform the following steps:

1. It assigns the first character of text to the variable head.
2. It assigns the middle portion of text (excluding the first and last characters) to the variable mid.
3. It assigns the last character of text to the variable tail.
4. It replaces all occurrences of n with m in head, mid, and tail.
5. It concatenates the modified head, mid, and tail together and assigns the result to the variable joined.
6. It returns the value of joined.

In this case, the input values are n = "x", m = "$", and text = "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris". Let's go through the steps:

1. head = "2"
2. mid = "xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hri"
3. tail = "s"
4. head.replace(n, m) = "2"
   mid.replace(n, m) = "$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri"
   tail.replace(n, m) = "s"
5. joined = "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris"
6. The return value is "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris".

<<<Output>>>
'2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris'
