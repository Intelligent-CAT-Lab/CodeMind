<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input. It iterates over the indices of the list in reverse order, starting from the last index and going backwards by 3 steps each time. 
Inside the loop, it checks if the value at the current index is 0. If it is, it clears the entire list using the clear() method and returns False.
If the loop completes without finding a 0, it returns the original list nums.

In this case, the input list is [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]. 
The loop starts at index 4 (the last index) and goes backwards by 3 steps each time. 
At index 4, the value is 1, so it does not match the condition for clearing the list.
At index 1, the value is 0, so the list is cleared and False is returned.

<<<Output>>>
False
