<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input: text and elem. It first checks if elem is not an empty string. If it is not empty, it enters a while loop that continues as long as text starts with elem. Inside the loop, it replaces elem with an empty string in text. After the loop, it enters another while loop that continues as long as elem starts with text. Inside this loop, it replaces text with an empty string in elem. Finally, it returns a list containing elem and text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "some" and "1", we need to go through the code step by step:
1. elem is not an empty string, so we enter the first while loop.
2. "some" does not start with "1", so the loop ends.
3. We enter the second while loop.
4. "1" does not start with "some", so the loop ends.
5. The function returns a list containing "1" and "some".

<<<Output>>>
['1', 'some']
