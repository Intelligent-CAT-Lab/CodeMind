<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string row as input and returns a tuple containing the count of '1's and '0's in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "100010010", we need to count the occurrences of '1' and '0' in the string.
There are 5 occurrences of '1' and 4 occurrences of '0' in the string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "100010010" is (5, 4).
<<<Output>>>
(5, 4)
