<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three inputs: text, position, and value. 
First, it calculates the length of the text and assigns it to the variable length.
Then, it calculates the index by taking the remainder of the position divided by the length.
If the position is less than 0, it assigns the index as the integer division of length by 2.
Next, it converts the text into a list and assigns it to the variable new_text.
It inserts the value at the index position in the new_text list.
Finally, it removes the last element from the new_text list and returns the joined string of the new_text list.

In this case, the input text is 'sduyai', the position is 1, and the value is 'y'.
The length of the text is 6.
The index is 1 % 6 = 1.
Therefore, the value 'y' will be inserted at index 1 in the new_text list.
The new_text list will be ['s', 'y', 'd', 'u', 'y', 'a'].
The last element 'a' will be removed from the new_text list.
The final output will be the joined string of the new_text list, which is 'syduya'.
<<<Output>>>
'syduya'
