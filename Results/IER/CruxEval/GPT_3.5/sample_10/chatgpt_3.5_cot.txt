<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and initializes a new empty string new_text.
Then, it iterates over each character ch in the input text after converting it to lowercase and removing any leading or trailing whitespace.
Inside the loop, it checks if the character ch is numeric or if it is one of the characters 'ÄäÏïÖöÜü'.
If either of these conditions is true, it appends the character ch to the new_text string.
Finally, it returns the new_text string.

In the case of an empty string as input, the for loop will not execute since there are no characters to iterate over.
Therefore, the new_text string will remain empty.
Thus, the return value of executing the function f on the input '' is an empty string.
