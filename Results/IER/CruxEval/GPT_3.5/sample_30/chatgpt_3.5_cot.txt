<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of elements as input and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the following conditions:
1. The element is a string and contains only ASCII characters, or
2. The element is an integer and its absolute value, when converted to a string, does not contain any ASCII characters.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ["a", "b", "c"], we need to iterate over each element in the input list and check if it satisfies the conditions. 

In this case, all the elements in the input list are strings and contain only ASCII characters. Therefore, all the elements satisfy the conditions and should be included in the output list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ["a", "b", "c"] is ["a", "b", "c"].
<<<Output>>>
['a', 'b', 'c']
