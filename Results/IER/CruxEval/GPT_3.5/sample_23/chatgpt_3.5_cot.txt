<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and chars. 
If chars is not empty, it removes any trailing characters in text that are present in chars using the rstrip() method. 
If chars is empty, it removes any trailing whitespace characters using the rstrip() method. 
If after removing the trailing characters, the resulting text is an empty string, it returns '-'. 
Otherwise, it returns the modified text. 

In this case, the input text is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2' and chars is '0123456789-'. 
The function will remove any trailing characters in text that are present in chars, which means it will remove the trailing '-' character. 
After removing the trailing '-', the resulting text is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2'. 
Since the resulting text is not an empty string, the function will return the modified text. 

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2'.
<<<Output>>>
'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2'
