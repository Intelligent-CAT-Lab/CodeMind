<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and new_ending. 
First, it converts the text into a list of characters using the list() function.
Then, it extends the list with the characters from new_ending using the extend() function.
Finally, it joins the characters in the list back into a string using the join() function and returns the result.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'jro' and 'wdlp', we need to follow these steps:
1. Convert 'jro' into a list: ['j', 'r', 'o']
2. Extend the list with the characters from 'wdlp': ['j', 'r', 'o', 'w', 'd', 'l', 'p']
3. Join the characters in the list back into a string: 'jrowdlp'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'jro' and 'wdlp' is 'jrowdlp'.
<<<Output>>>
'jrowdlp'
