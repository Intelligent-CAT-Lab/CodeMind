The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input. It first calculates the length of the list and assigns it to the variable count. Then, it enters a for loop that iterates over a list of 0s and 1s, where each element is the result of taking the modulo 2 of the corresponding index in the range from 0 to count-1. Inside the loop, it appends the element at index i in nums to the end of the list nums. Finally, it returns the modified list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1], we need to go through the code step by step:

1. Initialize count to 5 (the length of the input list).
2. Enter the for loop.
   - i = 0, nums[i] = nums[0] = -1, append -1 to nums -> nums = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1]
   - i = 1, nums[i] = nums[1] = 0, append 0 to nums -> nums = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, 0]
   - i = 2, nums[i] = nums[2] = 0, append 0 to nums -> nums = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, 0, 0]
   - i = 3, nums[i] = nums[3] = 1, append 1 to nums -> nums = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1]
   - i = 4, nums[i] = nums[4] = 1, append 1 to nums -> nums = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
3. Exit the for loop.
4. Return the modified list nums.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] is [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1].
