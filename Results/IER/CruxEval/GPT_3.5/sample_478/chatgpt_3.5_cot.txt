The function f takes a string sb as input and initializes an empty dictionary d. 
Then, it iterates over each character s in the string sb and updates the dictionary d by incrementing the value associated with the key s by 1. If the key s does not exist in the dictionary, it sets the value to 0 and then increments it by 1.
Finally, it returns the dictionary d.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'meow meow', we need to analyze the code step by step:
1. Initialize an empty dictionary d.
2. Iterate over each character s in the string 'meow meow'.
3. For the first character 'm', since it does not exist in the dictionary d, set the value to 0 and increment it by 1. Now, d = {'m': 1}.
4. For the second character 'e', since it does not exist in the dictionary d, set the value to 0 and increment it by 1. Now, d = {'m': 1, 'e': 1}.
5. For the third character 'o', since it does not exist in the dictionary d, set the value to 0 and increment it by 1. Now, d = {'m': 1, 'e': 1, 'o': 1}.
6. For the fourth character 'w', since it does not exist in the dictionary d, set the value to 0 and increment it by 1. Now, d = {'m': 1, 'e': 1, 'o': 1, 'w': 1}.
7. For the fifth character ' ', since it does not exist in the dictionary d, set the value to 0 and increment it by 1. Now, d = {'m': 1, 'e': 1, 'o': 1, 'w': 1, ' ': 1}.
8. For the sixth character 'm', since it already exists in the dictionary d, increment the value by 1. Now, d = {'m': 2, 'e': 1, 'o': 1, 'w': 1, ' ': 1}.
9. For the seventh character 'e', since it already exists in the dictionary d, increment the value by 1. Now, d = {'m': 2, 'e': 2, 'o': 1, 'w': 1, ' ': 1}.
10. For the eighth character 'o', since it already exists in the dictionary d, increment the value by 1. Now, d = {'m': 2, 'e': 2, 'o': 2, 'w': 1, ' ': 1}.
11. For the ninth character 'w', since it already exists in the dictionary d, increment the value by 1. Now, d = {'m': 2, 'e': 2, 'o': 2, 'w': 2, ' ': 1}.
12. For the tenth character ' ', since it already exists in the dictionary d, increment the value by 1. Now, d = {'m': 2, 'e': 2, 'o': 2, 'w': 2, ' ': 2}.

The final value of the dictionary d is {'m': 2, 'e': 2, 'o': 2, 'w': 2, ' ': 2}.

<<<Output>>>
{'m': 2, 'e': 2, 'o': 2, 'w': 2, ' ': 2}
