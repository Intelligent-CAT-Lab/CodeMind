<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: nums, idx, and added. It inserts the value of added at the index idx in the list nums using the slice assignment operation. Then, it returns the modified list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, 3, we need to perform the following steps:
1. Insert the value 3 at index 2 in the list [2, 2, 2, 3, 3].
2. Return the modified list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, 3 is [2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3]
