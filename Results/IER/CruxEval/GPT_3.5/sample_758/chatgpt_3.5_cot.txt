<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input. It checks if the reverse of the list nums is equal to the original list nums. If they are equal, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 3, 6, 2], we need to reverse the list [0, 3, 6, 2] and check if it is equal to the original list [0, 3, 6, 2].

The reverse of [0, 3, 6, 2] is [2, 6, 3, 0]. Since [2, 6, 3, 0] is not equal to [0, 3, 6, 2], the function will return False.

<<<Output>>>
False
