<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a number n as input and checks if it contains a decimal point. If it does, it converts n to an integer, adds 2.5 to it, and returns the result as a string. If n does not contain a decimal point, it simply returns n as a string.

In this case, the input is '800', which does not contain a decimal point. Therefore, the function will simply return '800' as a string.

<<<Output>>>
'800'
