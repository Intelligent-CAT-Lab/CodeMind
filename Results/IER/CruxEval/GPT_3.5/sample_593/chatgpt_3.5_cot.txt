<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a list of numbers `nums` and an integer `n`. 
The function initializes a variable `pos` to the index of the last element in `nums`.
Then, it enters a for loop that iterates over the range from `-len(nums)` to `0`.
Inside the loop, it inserts the element at index `i` in `nums` at the position `pos`.
Finally, it returns the modified `nums` list.

In this case, the input `nums` is an empty list and `n` is 14.
Since `nums` is empty, the for loop does not execute and the function directly returns the empty list.
