<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and replaces all occurrences of '(' with '[' and all occurrences of ')' with ']'.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "(ac)", we need to replace '(' with '[' and ')' with ']'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "(ac)" is "[ac]".
<<<Output>>>
'[ac]'
