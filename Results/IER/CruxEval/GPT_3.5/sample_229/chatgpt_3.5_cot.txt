The function f takes a dictionary dic and a value as input. It initializes an empty list called result. Then, it iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary. For each pair, it appends the first element of the key to the result list. If the second element of the key is equal to the given value, it reverses the result list. Otherwise, it appends the second element of the key to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.

In this case, the input dictionary is {'9m':2, 'mA':1, '10K':2, 'Lk':2} and the given value is 1. Let's go step by step:

1. Initialize an empty list called result: result = []
2. Iterate over each key-value pair in the dictionary:
   - For the first pair ('9m', 2):
     - Append the first element of the key to the result list: result = ['9']
     - The second element of the key (2) is not equal to the given value (1), so append it to the result list: result = ['9', 2]
   - For the second pair ('mA', 1):
     - Append the first element of the key to the result list: result = ['9', 2, 'm']
     - The second element of the key (1) is equal to the given value (1), so reverse the result list: result = ['m', 2, '9']
   - For the third pair ('10K', 2):
     - Append the first element of the key to the result list: result = ['m', 2, '9', '1']
     - The second element of the key (2) is not equal to the given value (1), so append it to the result list: result = ['m', 2, '9', '1', 2]
   - For the fourth pair ('Lk', 2):
     - Append the first element of the key to the result list: result = ['m', 2, '9', '1', 2, 'L']
     - The second element of the key (2) is not equal to the given value (1), so append it to the result list: result = ['m', 2, '9', '1', 2, 'L', 2]
3. Return the result list: ['m', 2, '9', '1', 2, 'L', 2]

<<<Output>>>
['m', 2, '9', '1', 2, 'L', 2]
