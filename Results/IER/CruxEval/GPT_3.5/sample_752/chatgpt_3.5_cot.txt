<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a string s and an integer amount. It returns a new string that is formed by adding 'z' characters to the beginning of s, such that the total length of the new string is equal to amount.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'abc' and 8, we need to calculate the difference between the amount and the length of s, which is 8 - 3 = 5. Then, we multiply this difference by the character 'z' to get 'zzzzz'. Finally, we concatenate this string with s to get 'zzzzzabc'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'abc' and 8 is 'zzzzzabc'.
<<<Output>>>
'zzzzzabc'
