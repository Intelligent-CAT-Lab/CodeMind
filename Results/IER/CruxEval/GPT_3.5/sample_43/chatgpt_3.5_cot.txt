<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a number n as input and checks if each character in the string representation of n is a digit. If any character is not a digit, the function sets n to -1 and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it returns the original value of n.

In this case, the input to the function is the string "6 ** 2". The function iterates over each character in the string and checks if it is a digit. However, the character "*" is not a digit, so the function sets n to -1 and breaks out of the loop. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "6 ** 2" is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
