<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a list and an operation. It creates a new list by making a copy of the input list. Then, it sorts the new list in ascending order. Next, it applies the operation on the new list. Finally, it returns the original input list.

In this case, the input list is [6, 4, 2, 8, 15] and the operation is a lambda function that reverses a list. 

The function first creates a new list by making a copy of the input list: [6, 4, 2, 8, 15]. 
Then, it sorts the new list in ascending order: [2, 4, 6, 8, 15]. 
Next, it applies the operation (lambda x: x.reverse()) on the new list. This lambda function reverses the list in-place, so the new list becomes [15, 8, 6, 4, 2]. 
Finally, it returns the original input list, which is [6, 4, 2, 8, 15].

Therefore, the return value of f([6, 4, 2, 8, 15], (lambda x: x.reverse())) is [6, 4, 2, 8, 15].
<<<Output>>>
[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]
