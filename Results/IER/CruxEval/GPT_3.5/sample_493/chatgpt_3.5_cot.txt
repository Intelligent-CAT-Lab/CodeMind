<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns a list of strings, where each string is in the format "key => value" for each key-value pair in the dictionary.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'-4':'4','1':'2','-':'-3'}, we need to iterate over each key-value pair in the dictionary and append a string representation of the pair to the list keys.
The first key-value pair is '-4':'4', so the string representation would be "-4 => 4".
The second key-value pair is '1':'2', so the string representation would be "1 => 2".
The third key-value pair is '-':'-3', so the string representation would be "- => -3".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'-4':'4','1':'2','-':'-3'} is ["-4 => 4", "1 => 2", "- => -3"].
<<<Output>>>
['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3']
