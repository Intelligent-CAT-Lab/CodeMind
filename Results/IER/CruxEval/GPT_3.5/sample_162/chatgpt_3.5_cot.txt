<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and initializes an empty string result. It then iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is alphanumeric (i.e., a letter or a digit), it converts the character to uppercase and appends it to the result string. Finally, it returns the result string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'с bishop.Swift', we need to analyze each character in the input string:
- The first character 'с' is not alphanumeric, so it is ignored.
- The second character ' ' (space) is not alphanumeric, so it is ignored.
- The third character 'b' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string.
- The fourth character 'i' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string.
- The fifth character 's' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string.
- The sixth character 'h' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string.
- The seventh character 'o' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string.
- The eighth character 'p' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string.
- The ninth character '.' (dot) is not alphanumeric, so it is ignored.
- The tenth character 'S' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string.
- The eleventh character 'w' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string.
- The twelfth character 'i' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string.
- The thirteenth character 'f' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string.
- The fourteenth character 't' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and appended to the result string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'с bishop.Swift' is 'BISHOPSIFT'.
