<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a string text and an integer position. 
First, it calculates the length of the text using the len() function and assigns it to the variable length.
Then, it calculates the index by taking the modulus of the position with (length + 1) and assigns it to the variable index.
Next, it checks if the position or index is less than 0. If either of them is less than 0, it assigns -1 to the index variable.
After that, it converts the text into a list of characters using the list() function and assigns it to the variable new_text.
Then, it removes the character at the index position from the new_text list using the pop() function.
Finally, it joins the characters in the new_text list back into a string using the ''.join() function and returns the result.

In this case, the input text is 'undbs l' and the position is 1.
The length of the text is 7.
The index is 1 % (7 + 1) = 1.
Since the position and index are both greater than or equal to 0, the index remains 1.
The new_text list is ['u', 'n', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l'].
The character at index 1 is 'n', so it is removed from the new_text list.
The new_text list becomes ['u', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l'].
The characters in the new_text list are joined back into a string, resulting in 'udbs l'.

<<<Output>>>
'udbs l'
