<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary graph as input and returns a new dictionary new_graph. 
The function iterates over each key-value pair in the input dictionary graph. 
For each key, it creates a new empty dictionary in the new_graph dictionary. 
Then, it iterates over each subkey in the value associated with the key in the input dictionary graph. 
For each subkey, it adds an empty string as the value in the new_graph dictionary, under the corresponding key and subkey.
Finally, it returns the new_graph dictionary.

In this case, the input dictionary is empty, so the function will not iterate over any key-value pairs. 
Therefore, the output will also be an empty dictionary.
