<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and initializes a variable ws to 0. It then iterates over each character s in the string text. If the character s is a whitespace character (determined using the isspace() method), it increments the ws variable by 1. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the value of ws and the length of the input text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds", we need to count the number of whitespace characters in the input text and calculate the length of the input text.

The input text contains 6 whitespace characters: " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", and " ".
The length of the input text is 32.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds" is (6, 32).
<<<Output>>>
(6, 32)
