<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: nums, odd1, and odd2. It removes all occurrences of odd1 and odd2 from the list nums using a while loop and the remove() method. Finally, it returns the modified list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the given input, we need to follow these steps:
1. Initialize the list nums with the given values: [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3].
2. Start the first while loop. Check if odd1 (3) is in nums. Since it is, remove all occurrences of 3 from nums. The modified nums becomes [1, 2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 5, 21].
3. Start the second while loop. Check if odd2 (1) is in nums. Since it is, remove all occurrences of 1 from nums. The modified nums becomes [2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 21].
4. The second while loop ends because odd2 (1) is no longer in nums.
5. Return the modified nums: [2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 21].

<<<Output>>>
[2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 21]
