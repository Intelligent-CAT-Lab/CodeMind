<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a dictionary data and an integer num. It creates a new empty dictionary new_dict and a list temp that contains the key-value pairs of the input dictionary data. 

Then, it iterates over the range from len(temp) - 1 to num - 1 with a step of -1. In each iteration, it assigns the key-value pair temp[i] as a key in the new_dict dictionary with a value of None.

Finally, it returns the sublist of temp starting from index num and concatenates it with the key-value pairs of new_dict converted to a list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1} and 1, we need to go through the code step by step:

1. Create an empty dictionary new_dict.
2. Create a list temp that contains the key-value pairs of the input dictionary: [(1, 9), (2, 10), (3, 1)].
3. Iterate over the range from 2 to 1 with a step of -1. Since the range is empty, the loop is not executed.
4. Return the sublist of temp starting from index 1 and concatenate it with the key-value pairs of new_dict converted to a list. The sublist of temp starting from index 1 is [(2, 10), (3, 1)]. The key-value pairs of new_dict converted to a list is [].
5. Concatenating [(2, 10), (3, 1)] with [] gives [(2, 10), (3, 1)].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1} and 1 is [(2, 10), (3, 1)].
