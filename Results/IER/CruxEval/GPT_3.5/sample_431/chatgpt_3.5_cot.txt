<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two integers n and m as input. It creates a list arr containing numbers from 1 to n. Then, it enters a loop that iterates m times. In each iteration, it clears the list arr. Finally, it returns the cleared list arr.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (1, 3), we need to follow the steps:
1. Create a list arr containing numbers from 1 to 1: [1]
2. Enter the loop and clear the list arr: []
3. Repeat step 2 two more times since m is 3.
4. Return the cleared list arr: []
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (1, 3) is an empty list [].

[]
