<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: an array and an element. 
First, the function reverses the array using the reverse() method.
Then, it tries to find the index of the given element in the reversed array using the index() method.
If the element is found, the index is stored in the variable 'found'.
Finally, the function reverses the array again to restore its original order.
The function then returns the value stored in 'found'.

In this case, the input array is [5, -3, 3, 2] and the element is 2.
The array is reversed to become [2, 3, -3, 5].
The index of 2 in the reversed array is 0.
The array is reversed again to become [5, -3, 3, 2].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, -3, 3, 2] and 2 is 0.
