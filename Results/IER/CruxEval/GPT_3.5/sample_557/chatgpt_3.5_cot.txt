<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string str as input and uses the rpartition() method to split the string into three parts: the part before the last occurrence of 'ar', the 'ar' itself, and the part after 'ar'. 
Then, it uses the join() method to concatenate these three parts with a space in between.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'xxxarmmarxx', we need to split the string into three parts: 'xxx', 'ar', and 'mmarxx', and then join them with a space in between.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'xxxarmmarxx' is 'xxx ar mmarxx'.
<<<Output>>>
'xxx ar mmarxx'
