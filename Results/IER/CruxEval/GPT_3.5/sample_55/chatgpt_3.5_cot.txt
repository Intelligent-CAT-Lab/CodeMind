The function f takes an array as input and performs the following steps:
1. It initializes an empty array called array_2.
2. It iterates over each element i in the input array.
3. If the element i is greater than 0, it appends i to the array_2.
4. After iterating over all elements, it sorts the array_2 in descending order.
5. Finally, it returns the sorted array_2.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14], we need to follow these steps:
1. Initialize array_2 as an empty array.
2. Iterate over each element in the input array.
3. For each element, check if it is greater than 0.
4. If it is greater than 0, append it to array_2.
5. After iterating over all elements, sort array_2 in descending order.
6. Return the sorted array_2.

Let's go through the steps:
1. Initialize array_2 as an empty array: array_2 = []
2. Iterate over each element in the input array:
   - For i = 4, check if it is greater than 0. It is, so append it to array_2: array_2 = [4]
   - For i = 8, check if it is greater than 0. It is, so append it to array_2: array_2 = [4, 8]
   - For i = 17, check if it is greater than 0. It is, so append it to array_2: array_2 = [4, 8, 17]
   - For i = 89, check if it is greater than 0. It is, so append it to array_2: array_2 = [4, 8, 17, 89]
   - For i = 43, check if it is greater than 0. It is, so append it to array_2: array_2 = [4, 8, 17, 89, 43]
   - For i = 14, check if it is greater than 0. It is, so append it to array_2: array_2 = [4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14]
3. Sort array_2 in descending order: array_2 = [89, 43, 17, 14, 8, 4]
4. Return the sorted array_2: [89, 43, 17, 14, 8, 4]

<<<Output>>>
[89, 43, 17, 14, 8, 4]
