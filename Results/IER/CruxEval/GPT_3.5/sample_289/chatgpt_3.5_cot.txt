<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string code as input and returns a formatted string that includes the input code and the encoded version of the code.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '148', we need to format the string with the input code and the encoded version of the code.
The encoded version of the code '148' can be obtained by calling the encode() method on the code string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '148' is "148: b'148'".
<<<Output>>>
'148: b\'148\''
