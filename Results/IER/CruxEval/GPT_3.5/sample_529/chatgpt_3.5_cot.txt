<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array with consecutive duplicate elements removed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to iterate over the elements of the array and check if the current element is equal to the previous element. If they are equal, we remove the current element from the new array. Otherwise, we keep the current element in the new array.
In this case, the input array [1, 2, 3] does not have any consecutive duplicate elements, so the new array will be the same as the input array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3]
