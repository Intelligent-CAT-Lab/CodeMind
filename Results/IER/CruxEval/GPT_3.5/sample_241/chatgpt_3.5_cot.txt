<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string postcode as input and returns a substring of postcode starting from the first occurrence of the letter 'C' until the end of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ED20 CW', we need to find the index of the first occurrence of 'C' in the string 'ED20 CW', which is 5. Then we extract the substring starting from index 5 until the end of the string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ED20 CW' is 'CW'.
<<<Output>>>
'CW'
