<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and creates a new list new_text by replacing each digit in text with '*'. It then joins the elements of new_text into a single string and returns it.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '5f83u23saa', we need to replace each digit in the input string with '*'. The resulting string would be '*****u**saa'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '5f83u23saa' is '*****u**saa'.
<<<Output>>>
'*****u**saa'
