<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary dic as input and returns a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary. The sorting is done based on the keys of the dictionary in ascending order.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'b': 1, 'a': 2}, we need to sort the key-value pairs based on the keys. The keys in the dictionary are 'b' and 'a', and when sorted in ascending order, the order becomes 'a' and 'b'. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'b': 1, 'a': 2} is [('a', 2), ('b', 1)].

<<<Output>>>
[('a', 2), ('b', 1)]
