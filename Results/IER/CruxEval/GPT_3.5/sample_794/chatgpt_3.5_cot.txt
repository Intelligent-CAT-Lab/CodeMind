The function f takes a string line as input and initializes an empty list a. 
Then, it iterates over each character c in the input string line. 
If the character c is alphanumeric (i.e., a letter or a digit), it appends it to the list a. 
Finally, it joins all the characters in the list a into a single string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'", we need to analyze each character in the input string:
- The first character "\" is not alphanumeric, so it is not added to the list a.
- The second character "\\" is not alphanumeric, so it is not added to the list a.
- The third character "%" is not alphanumeric, so it is not added to the list a.
- The fourth character "$" is not alphanumeric, so it is not added to the list a.
- The fifth character " " is not alphanumeric, so it is not added to the list a.
- The sixth character "n" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The seventh character "o" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The eighth character "r" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The ninth character "m" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The tenth character "a" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The eleventh character "l" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The twelfth character " " is not alphanumeric, so it is not added to the list a.
- The thirteenth character "c" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The fourteenth character "h" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The fifteenth character "a" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The sixteenth character "r" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The seventeenth character "s" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The eighteenth character " " is not alphanumeric, so it is not added to the list a.
- The nineteenth character "$" is not alphanumeric, so it is not added to the list a.
- The twentieth character "%" is not alphanumeric, so it is not added to the list a.
- The twenty-first character "~" is not alphanumeric, so it is not added to the list a.
- The twenty-second character " " is not alphanumeric, so it is not added to the list a.
- The twenty-third character "q" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The twenty-fourth character "w" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The twenty-fifth character "e" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The twenty-sixth character "t" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The twenty-seventh character "4" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The twenty-eighth character "2" is alphanumeric, so it is added to the list a.
- The twenty-ninth character "'" is not alphanumeric, so it is not added to the list a.

After iterating over all the characters in the input string, the list a contains the alphanumeric characters "normalcharsqwet42". 
The function then joins these characters into a single string and returns it.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'" is "normalcharsqwet42".
<<<Output>>>
'normalcharsqwet42'
