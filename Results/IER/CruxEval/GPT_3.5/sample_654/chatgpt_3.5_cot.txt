<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: s, from_c, and to_c. It uses the maketrans() method to create a translation table that maps each character in from_c to the corresponding character in to_c. Then, it uses the translate() method to apply the translation table to the string s and return the translated string.

In this case, the input string is 'aphid', the from_c character is 'i', and the to_c character is '?'.
The translation table will map 'i' to '?'.
Then, the translate() method will replace all occurrences of 'i' with '?' in the string 'aphid'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'aphid', 'i', '?' is 'aph?d'.
<<<Output>>>
'aph?d'
