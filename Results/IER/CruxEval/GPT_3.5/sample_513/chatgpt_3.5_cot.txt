<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and performs the following steps:
1. It enters a while loop as long as -1 is present in the array. Inside the loop, it removes the element at index -3 from the array using the pop() method.
2. It then enters another while loop as long as 0 is present in the array. Inside the loop, it removes the last element from the array using the pop() method.
3. Finally, it enters a while loop as long as 1 is present in the array. Inside the loop, it removes the first element from the array using the pop() method.
4. After all the while loops have finished, it returns the modified array.

In the given input, the array is [0, 2]. Let's go through the steps:
1. The first while loop is not entered because -1 is not present in the array.
2. The second while loop is entered because 0 is present in the array. The last element, 2, is removed from the array.
3. The third while loop is not entered because 1 is not present in the array.
4. The modified array is [0].

Therefore, the return value of f([0, 2]) is [0].
