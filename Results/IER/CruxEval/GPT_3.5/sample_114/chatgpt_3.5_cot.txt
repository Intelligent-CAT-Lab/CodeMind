<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and sep. It uses the rsplit() method to split the text into a list of substrings, using sep as the delimiter. The maxsplit parameter is set to 2, which means that the splitting will stop after the second occurrence of sep.

In this case, the input text is "a-.-.b" and the sep is "-.". The rsplit() method will split the text into substrings at the occurrences of "-.", starting from the right side. Since the maxsplit parameter is set to 2, the splitting will stop after the second occurrence.

The first occurrence of "-." is at index 1, so the text will be split into two substrings: "a" and "b". The second occurrence of "-." is at index 3, but since the maxsplit parameter is set to 2, the splitting will stop here.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "a-.-.b" with sep "-." is ['a', 'b'].

['a', 'b']
