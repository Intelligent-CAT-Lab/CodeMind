<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and splits it into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter. Then, it iterates over each word in the list and checks if it is numeric using the isnumeric() method. If any word is not numeric, the function immediately returns 'no'. If all words are numeric, the function returns 'yes'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '03625163633 d', we need to split the string into words: ['03625163633', 'd']. Then, we iterate over each word and check if it is numeric. The first word '03625163633' is numeric, but the second word 'd' is not numeric. Therefore, the function should return 'no'.

<<<Output>>>
'no'
