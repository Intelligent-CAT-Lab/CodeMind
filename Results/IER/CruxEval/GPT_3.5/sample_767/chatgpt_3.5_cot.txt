The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following steps:
1. It removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string using the strip() method.
2. It splits the input string into a list of substrings using the split(' ') method, where each substring is separated by a space.
3. It iterates over each substring in the list using a for loop.
4. For each substring, it checks if it is a digit using the isdigit() method. If the substring is not a digit, it returns '-'.
5. If all substrings are digits, it joins the substrings back into a single string using the join() method, with each substring separated by a space.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41", we need to follow these steps:
1. Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the input string: "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41" -> "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41"
2. Split the input string into a list of substrings: ["d", "khqw", "whi", "fwi", "bbn", "41"]
3. Iterate over each substring in the list:
   - Check if "d" is a digit (it is not), so return '-'
4. The output of executing the function f on the input "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41" is '-'

<<<Output>>>
'-'
