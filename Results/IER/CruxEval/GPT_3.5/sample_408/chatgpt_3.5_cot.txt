<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list m as input and reverses the order of the elements in the list using the reverse() method. Then it returns the reversed list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-4, 6, 0, 4, -7, 2, -1], we need to reverse the order of the elements in the list.
After reversing the list, the output would be [-1, 2, -7, 4, 0, 6, -4].
<<<Output>>>
[-1, 2, -7, 4, 0, 6, -4]
