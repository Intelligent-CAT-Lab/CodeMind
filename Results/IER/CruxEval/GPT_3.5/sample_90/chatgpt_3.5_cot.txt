<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list of lists. 
It creates an empty list called return_arr. 
Then, it iterates over each element a in the input array. 
For each element a, it appends a copy of a to the return_arr list. 
Finally, it returns the return_arr list. 

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]], we need to go through the steps of the function:
1. Create an empty list called return_arr.
2. Iterate over each element a in the input array.
3. For the first element [1, 2, 3], append a copy of [1, 2, 3] to return_arr.
4. For the second element [], append a copy of [] to return_arr.
5. For the third element [1, 2, 3], append a copy of [1, 2, 3] to return_arr.
6. Return the return_arr list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]] is [[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]].
<<<Output>>>
[[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]]
