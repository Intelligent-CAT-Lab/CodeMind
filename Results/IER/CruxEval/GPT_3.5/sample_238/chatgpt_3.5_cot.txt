<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a list of lists `ls` and an integer `n`. It initializes a variable `answer` to 0. Then, it iterates over each element `i` in the list `ls`. For each element `i`, it checks if the first element of `i` is equal to `n`. If it is, it assigns `i` to the variable `answer`. Finally, it returns the value of `answer`.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]` and `1`, we need to go through the steps of the function:

1. Initialize `answer` to 0.
2. Iterate over each element `i` in the list `[[1, 9, 4], [83, 0, 5], [9, 6, 100]]`.
3. For the first element `[1, 9, 4]`, check if the first element `1` is equal to `1`. It is, so assign `[1, 9, 4]` to `answer`.
4. For the second element `[83, 0, 5]`, check if the first element `83` is equal to `1`. It is not, so do nothing.
5. For the third element `[9, 6, 100]`, check if the first element `9` is equal to `1`. It is not, so do nothing.
6. Return the value of `answer`, which is `[1, 9, 4]`.
