The function f takes a list of lists called messages as input. It initializes a variable phone_code with the value "+353" and an empty list called result. 

Then, it iterates over each list in messages using a for loop. For each list, it extends the list with the phone_code, which means it appends the phone_code to the end of the list. 

Next, it joins the elements of the list with a semicolon using the join() method and appends the resulting string to the result list. 

Finally, it joins the elements of the result list with a period using the join() method and returns the resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [['Marie','Nelson','Oscar']], we need to go through the code step by step:

1. Initialize phone_code as "+353".
2. Initialize result as an empty list.
3. Iterate over the list ['Marie','Nelson','Oscar'].
4. Extend the list with phone_code, resulting in ['Marie','Nelson','Oscar','+353'].
5. Join the elements of the list with a semicolon, resulting in "Marie;Nelson;Oscar;+353".
6. Append the resulting string to the result list.
7. Join the elements of the result list with a period, resulting in "Marie;Nelson;Oscar;+353".
8. Return the resulting string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [['Marie','Nelson','Oscar']] is "Marie;Nelson;Oscar;+353".
<<<Output>>>
'Marie;Nelson;Oscar;+353'
