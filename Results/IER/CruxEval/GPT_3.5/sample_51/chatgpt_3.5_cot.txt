<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a variable s which is a string consisting of 10 '<' characters. 
Then, it defines a function f that takes a number num as input. 
If num is divisible by 2 (i.e., num % 2 == 0), the function returns the value of s. 
Otherwise, it returns the value of num - 1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 21, we need to check if 21 is divisible by 2. Since 21 is not divisible by 2, the function will return 21 - 1, which is 20.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 21 is 20.

20
