<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input: text and chars. It initializes the variable num_applies to 2 and extra_chars to an empty string. 

Then, it enters a for loop that iterates twice. In each iteration, it concatenates the string chars to the variable extra_chars using the += operator. 

Next, it replaces all occurrences of extra_chars in the string text with an empty string using the replace() method. 

Finally, it returns the modified text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'zbzquiuqnmfkx' and 'mk', we need to follow the steps described above.

In the first iteration of the for loop, extra_chars becomes 'mk' and text becomes 'zbzquiuqnmfkx'. The replace() method does not find any occurrences of 'mk' in 'zbzquiuqnmfkx', so text remains unchanged.

In the second iteration of the for loop, extra_chars becomes 'mkmk' and text remains 'zbzquiuqnmfkx'. The replace() method replaces all occurrences of 'mkmk' in 'zbzquiuqnmfkx' with an empty string, resulting in 'zbzquiuqnfkx'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'zbzquiuqnmfkx' and 'mk' is 'zbzquiuqnfkx'.
