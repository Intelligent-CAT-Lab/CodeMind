The function f takes a string body as input and performs the following steps:
1. Convert the string body into a list of characters and assign it to the variable ls.
2. Initialize a variable dist to 0.
3. Iterate over the range from 0 to the length of ls - 1.
4. Inside the loop, check if the character at index i - 2 (if i - 2 is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise use 0) in ls is equal to '\t'.
5. If the condition is true, increment dist by (1 + the count of '\t' in the character at index i - 1) multiplied by 3.
6. Wrap the character at index i in ls with square brackets and assign it back to the same index in ls.
7. After the loop, join the characters in ls into a single string using the join() method and assign it to the variable result.
8. Expand the tabs in result by replacing each tab character with 4 + dist spaces.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '\n\ny\n', we need to follow these steps:
1. Convert '\n\ny\n' into a list of characters: ['\n', '\n', 'y', '\n'] and assign it to ls.
2. Initialize dist to 0.
3. Iterate over the range from 0 to len(ls) - 1, which is from 0 to 3.
4. At index 0, the character is '\n', so the condition in the if statement is false.
5. At index 1, the character is '\n', so the condition in the if statement is false.
6. At index 2, the character is 'y', so the condition in the if statement is false.
7. At index 3, the character is '\n', so the condition in the if statement is false.
8. Wrap each character in ls with square brackets: ['\n', '\n', '[y]', '\n'].
9. Join the characters in ls into a single string: '\n\n[y]\n'.
10. Expand the tabs in the string by replacing each tab character with 4 + dist spaces. Since there are no tab characters in the string, the result remains the same: '\n\n[y]\n'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '\n\ny\n' is '\n\n[y]\n'.

'\n\n[y]\n'
