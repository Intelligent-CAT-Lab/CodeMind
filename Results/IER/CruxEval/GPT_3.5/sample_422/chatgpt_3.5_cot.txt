<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input. It creates a new array by making a copy of the input array. Then, it reverses the new array using the `reversed()` function. Finally, it returns a new list comprehension that squares each element in the reversed array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 1], we need to follow these steps:
1. Create a new array by making a copy of the input array: [1, 2, 1]
2. Reverse the new array: [1, 2, 1]
3. Square each element in the reversed array: [1, 4, 1]

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 1] is [1, 4, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 1]
