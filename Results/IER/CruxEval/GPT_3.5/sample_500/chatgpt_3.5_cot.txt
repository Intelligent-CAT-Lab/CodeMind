<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a delimiter delim. It returns a substring of text that starts from the beginning and ends at the first occurrence of delim in the reversed text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'dsj osq wi w' and ' ', we need to reverse the text and find the index of the first occurrence of ' '. Then, we need to extract the substring from the beginning of the original text to that index.

Reversing the text 'dsj osq wi w' gives 'w iw qso jsd'. The index of the first occurrence of ' ' in the reversed text is 2. Therefore, the substring from the beginning of the original text to index 2 is 'dsj'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'dsj osq wi w' and ' ' is 'dsj'.
<<<Output>>>
'dsj'
