<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input. It creates a new list called floats, which contains the fractional part of each number in the input list. This is done by taking the modulus of each number with 1. 
If the value 1 is present in the floats list, then the function returns the floats list. Otherwise, it returns an empty list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input range(100, 120), we need to calculate the fractional part of each number in the range and check if 1 is present in the resulting list.

The range(100, 120) generates a sequence of numbers from 100 to 119 (inclusive). For each number in this range, we calculate the fractional part by taking the modulus with 1. Since all the numbers in this range are integers, the fractional part for each number will be 0.

Therefore, the floats list will contain only 0's. Since 1 is not present in the floats list, the function will return an empty list.
