<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following steps:
1. Reverse the string text and store it in the variable ls.
2. Initialize an empty string text2.
3. Iterate over the range from len(ls) - 3 to 0 with a step of -3.
4. For each iteration, concatenate the elements of ls[i:i+3] with '---' in between and add '---' at the end.
5. Return text2 without the last three characters.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'scala', we need to follow these steps:
1. Reverse the string 'scala' to get 'alacs'.
2. Iterate over the range from 4 to 0 with a step of -3.
   - In the first iteration, concatenate 's---c---a---' to text2.
   - In the second iteration, concatenate 'l---a---' to text2.
3. Return text2 without the last three characters, which is 's---c---a---l---a'.

<<<Output>>>
's---c---a---l---a'
