<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a list of strings and a substring. 
It creates a new list called "list" by iterating over each string in the input list and checking if it starts with the given substring.
Then, it sorts the "list" based on the length of each string using the sorted() function.
Finally, it returns the sorted "list".

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['condor', 'eyes', 'gay', 'isa'] and 'd', we need to follow these steps:
1. Iterate over each string in the input list and check if it starts with the substring 'd'.
   - 'condor' does not start with 'd', so it is not added to the "list".
   - 'eyes' does not start with 'd', so it is not added to the "list".
   - 'gay' does not start with 'd', so it is not added to the "list".
   - 'isa' does not start with 'd', so it is not added to the "list".
2. Sort the "list" based on the length of each string.
   - The "list" is currently empty, so there is nothing to sort.
3. Return the sorted "list".
   - The "list" is still empty, so the return value is an empty list.
