<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums and two indices pop1 and pop2 as input. It removes the elements at indices pop1-1 and pop2-1 from the list nums using the pop() method. Then, it returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 2, 3, 6], 2, 4, we need to remove the elements at indices 2-1 and 4-1 from the list [1, 5, 2, 3, 6]. After removing these elements, the list becomes [1, 2, 6].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 2, 3, 6], 2, 4 is [1, 2, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 6]
