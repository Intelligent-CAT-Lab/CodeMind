The function f takes a variable var as input and checks its type. 
First, it checks if var is a digit using the isdigit() method. If it is, it returns "int".
If var is not a digit, it checks if it can be converted to a float by removing the first occurrence of a dot and checking if the remaining string is a digit. If it is, it returns "float".
If var is not a digit or a float, it checks if it consists of only spaces except for one character. If it does, it returns "str".
If var does not meet any of the above conditions, it checks if its length is equal to 1. If it is, it returns "char".
If var does not meet any of the above conditions, it returns "tuple".

In this case, the input " 99 777" consists of spaces and digits, so it will meet the condition for "str". Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input " 99 777" is "str".
