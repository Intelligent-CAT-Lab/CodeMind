<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and checks if the number of occurrences of the character '-' in the string is equal to the length of the string. If it is, then it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "---123-4", we need to count the number of occurrences of '-' in the string and compare it with the length of the string.

The string "---123-4" has 4 occurrences of '-', and its length is 9. Since 4 is not equal to 9, the function will return False.

<<<Output>>>
False
