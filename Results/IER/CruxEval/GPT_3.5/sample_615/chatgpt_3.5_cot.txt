<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: in_list, which is a list, and num, which is an integer. 
First, the function appends the value of num to the end of in_list using the append() method.
Then, it finds the index of the maximum value in in_list[:-1], which is a slice of in_list excluding the last element.
Finally, it returns the index of the maximum value.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 12, -6, -2] and -1, we need to follow these steps:
1. Append -1 to the end of the list, resulting in [-1, 12, -6, -2, -1].
2. Find the index of the maximum value in the list excluding the last element, which is 12.
3. Return the index of 12, which is 1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 12, -6, -2] and -1 is 1.
