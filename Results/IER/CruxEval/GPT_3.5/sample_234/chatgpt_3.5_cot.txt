<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and char. It first initializes the variable position to the length of the text. Then, it checks if the char is present in the text using the in operator. If it is present, it updates the position variable to the index of the char in the text. 

Next, it checks if the position is greater than 1. If it is, it updates the position variable to (position + 1) % len(text). This means that if the position is greater than 1, it will be incremented by 1 and then wrapped around to the beginning of the text if it exceeds the length of the text.

Finally, it returns the value of the position variable.

In this case, the text is 'wduhzxlfk' and the char is 'w'. The char 'w' is present in the text at index 0. Since the position is not greater than 1, it remains 0. Therefore, the return value of f('wduhzxlfk', 'w') is 0.
