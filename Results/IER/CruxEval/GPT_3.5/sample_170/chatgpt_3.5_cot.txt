<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a list of numbers `nums` and a number `number`. It returns the number of times `number` appears in the list `nums`.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [12, 0, 13, 4, 12] and 12, we need to count the number of times 12 appears in the list [12, 0, 13, 4, 12].

The number 12 appears twice in the list, so the output of executing the function f on the input [12, 0, 13, 4, 12] and 12 is 2.
