<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list list_x as input and performs the following steps:
1. It determines the number of items in the list_x using the len() function and assigns it to the variable item_count.
2. It initializes an empty list new_list.
3. It enters a for loop that iterates over the range of item_count.
4. In each iteration, it removes the last item from list_x using the pop() method and appends it to new_list.
5. After the loop finishes, it returns new_list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 6, 8, 4], we need to follow these steps:
1. The item_count will be 5.
2. The new_list will be initialized as an empty list.
3. In the first iteration of the loop, the last item of list_x (4) will be removed and appended to new_list.
4. In the second iteration, the last item of list_x (8) will be removed and appended to new_list.
5. In the third iteration, the last item of list_x (6) will be removed and appended to new_list.
6. In the fourth iteration, the last item of list_x (8) will be removed and appended to new_list.
7. In the fifth iteration, the last item of list_x (5) will be removed and appended to new_list.
8. After the loop finishes, new_list will contain [4, 8, 6, 8, 5].
9. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 6, 8, 4] is [4, 8, 6, 8, 5].

[4, 8, 6, 8, 5]
