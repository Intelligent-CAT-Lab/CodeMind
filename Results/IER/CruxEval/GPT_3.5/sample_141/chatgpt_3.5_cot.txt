<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list li as input and returns a new list. The new list contains the count of each element in the original list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['k', 'x', 'c', 'x', 'x', 'b', 'l', 'f', 'r', 'n', 'g'], we need to count the occurrences of each element in the list.
The count of 'k' in the list is 1.
The count of 'x' in the list is 3.
The count of 'c' in the list is 1.
The count of 'b' in the list is 1.
The count of 'l' in the list is 1.
The count of 'f' in the list is 1.
The count of 'r' in the list is 1.
The count of 'n' in the list is 1.
The count of 'g' in the list is 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['k', 'x', 'c', 'x', 'x', 'b', 'l', 'f', 'r', 'n', 'g'] is [1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
