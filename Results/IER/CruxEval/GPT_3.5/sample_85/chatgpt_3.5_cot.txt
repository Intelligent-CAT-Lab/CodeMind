The function f takes an integer n as input and returns a sorted list of values. 
Inside the function, there is a dictionary called values, which contains key-value pairs. The keys are integers and the values can be integers, floats, or strings. 
There is also an empty dictionary called res. 
The function then iterates over the key-value pairs in the values dictionary using the items() method. 
For each key-value pair, if the key modulo n is not equal to 2, it adds the value to the res dictionary with the key being the value of n divided by 2. 
Finally, the function returns the sorted values of the res dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 12, we need to go through the steps of the function:
1. The values dictionary contains the following key-value pairs: {0: 3, 1: 4.5, 2: '-'}.
2. The res dictionary is initially empty.
3. The function iterates over the key-value pairs in the values dictionary.
   - For the first key-value pair (0: 3), the key modulo 12 is 0, so it does not satisfy the condition i % n != 2. Therefore, it does not add anything to the res dictionary.
   - For the second key-value pair (1: 4.5), the key modulo 12 is 1, so it does not satisfy the condition i % n != 2. Therefore, it does not add anything to the res dictionary.
   - For the third key-value pair (2: '-'), the key modulo 12 is 2, so it satisfies the condition i % n != 2. Therefore, it adds the value '-' to the res dictionary with the key being the value of n divided by 2, which is 6.
4. The res dictionary now contains the following key-value pair: {'-': 6}.
5. The function returns the sorted values of the res dictionary, which is ['-'].
