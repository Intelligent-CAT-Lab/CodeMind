The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a character char. It initializes a new variable new_text with the value of text. It also initializes an empty list a.
The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as the character char is present in the string new_text. Inside the loop, it appends the index of the first occurrence of char in new_text to the list a using the index() method. It then replaces the first occurrence of char in new_text with an empty string using the replace() method with a count of 1.
Once the while loop condition is no longer satisfied, the function returns the list a.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'rvr' with char 'r', we need to step through the code:
1. new_text = 'rvr', a = []
2. char 'r' is present in new_text, so append the index of 'r' (0) to a and replace the first occurrence of 'r' in new_text with an empty string. new_text = 'vr', a = [0]
3. char 'r' is present in new_text, so append the index of 'r' (1) to a and replace the first occurrence of 'r' in new_text with an empty string. new_text = 'v', a = [0, 1]
4. char 'r' is not present in new_text, so exit the while loop.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'rvr' with char 'r' is [0, 1].
