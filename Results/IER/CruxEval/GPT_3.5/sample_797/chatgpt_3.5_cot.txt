<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary dct as input and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary, sorted by the keys in ascending order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, we need to iterate over the keys of the dictionary in sorted order and append each key-value pair as a tuple to the list.
The sorted keys are 'a', 'b', and 'c', so the resulting list of tuples would be [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} is [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)].
<<<Output>>>
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
