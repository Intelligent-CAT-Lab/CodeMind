<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three inputs: text, sep, and num. It uses the rsplit() method to split the text into a list of substrings, using the sep as the delimiter. The num parameter specifies the maximum number of splits to perform. The rsplit() method starts splitting the text from the right side.

In this case, the input text is 'aa+++bb', the sep is '+', and the num is 1. So, the rsplit() method will split the text into two substrings: 'aa+++' and 'bb'. Then, the '___'.join() method is used to join these substrings with the separator '___'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'aa+++bb', '+', 1 is 'aa___bb'.
<<<Output>>>
'aa___bb'
