<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input. It first calculates the middle index of the list by dividing the length of the list by 2 using integer division. Then, it returns the concatenation of two slices of the list: nums[middle:] which includes all elements from the middle index to the end of the list, and nums[0:middle] which includes all elements from the beginning of the list to the middle index.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1], we need to find the middle index of the list, which is 1. Then, we concatenate the two slices of the list: [1:] which is [1] and [0:1] which is [1]. The concatenation of these two slices is [1, 1].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1] is [1, 1].

[1, 1]
