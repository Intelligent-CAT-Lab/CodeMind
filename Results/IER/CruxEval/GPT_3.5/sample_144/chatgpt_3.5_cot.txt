<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of vectors as input and returns a new list of vectors where each vector is sorted in ascending order.
In this case, the input is an empty list, so there are no vectors to sort.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [] is an empty list [].
<<<Output>>>
[]
