<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string multi_string as input. It splits the string into a list of words using the split() method. Then, it checks if any of the words in the list contain non-ASCII characters by applying the isascii() method to each word using the map() function. The result is a list of boolean values indicating whether each word is ASCII or not.

If any of the words in the list is ASCII, the function returns a string that contains only the ASCII words, separated by commas. This is achieved by using a list comprehension to filter out the non-ASCII words and then joining the remaining words with commas using the join() method.

If none of the words in the list is ASCII, the function returns an empty string.

In the given input "I am hungry! eat food.", all the words are ASCII, so the function will return a string that contains all the words separated by commas: "I, am, hungry!, eat, food.".

<<<Output>>>
'I, am, hungry!, eat, food.'
