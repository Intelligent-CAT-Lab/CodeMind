<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and suffix. It checks if the text ends with the suffix. If it does, it returns the text without the suffix. If it doesn't, it returns the original text.
In this case, the text is 'zejrohaj' and the suffix is 'owc'. Since the text does not end with the suffix, the function will return the original text, which is 'zejrohaj'.
<<<Output>>>
'zejrohaj'
