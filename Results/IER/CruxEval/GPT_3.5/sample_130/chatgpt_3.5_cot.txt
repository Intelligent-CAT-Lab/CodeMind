The function f takes a dictionary m as input. 
First, it converts the dictionary into a list of tuples using the items() method.
Then, it iterates over the range from len(items)-2 to -1 with a step of -1.
Inside the loop, it swaps the current tuple with the next tuple in the list.
After the loop, it checks the length of the items list modulo 2.
If the result is 0, it returns the first string in the list ['{}={}', '{1}={0}'] formatted with the keys and values of the dictionary.
If the result is 1, it returns the second string in the list formatted with the keys and values of the dictionary.

In this case, the input dictionary is {'l':4, 'h':6, 'o':9}.
The items list would be [('l', 4), ('h', 6), ('o', 9)].
The loop would swap the tuples in the list, resulting in [('o', 9), ('h', 6), ('l', 4)].
The length of the items list is 3, which is odd, so the second string in the list would be used for formatting.
The keys and values of the dictionary would be formatted into the string '{1}={0}', resulting in '9=o'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'l':4, 'h':6, 'o':9} is '9=o'.

'9=o'
