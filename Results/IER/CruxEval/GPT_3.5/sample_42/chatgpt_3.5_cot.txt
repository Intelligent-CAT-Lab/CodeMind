<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input. 
First, it clears the list nums using the clear() method.
Then, it iterates over each element num in the empty list nums, which means the loop will not execute.
Finally, it returns the empty list nums.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2] is an empty list [].
