<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and amount. It first calculates the length of the text. Then it initializes a variable pre_text with the string '|'. If the amount is greater than or equal to the length of the text, it calculates the extra_space by subtracting the length from the amount. It then appends extra_space number of spaces to pre_text. Finally, it returns the concatenation of pre_text, text, and pre_text. If the amount is less than the length of the text, it simply returns the text.

In this case, the length of the text "GENERAL NAGOOR" is 14. The amount is 5, which is less than the length of the text. Therefore, the function will return the text "GENERAL NAGOOR".

<<<Output>>>
'GENERAL NAGOOR'
