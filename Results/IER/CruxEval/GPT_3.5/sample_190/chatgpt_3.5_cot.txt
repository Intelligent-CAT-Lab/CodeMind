<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and initializes an empty string short. It then iterates over each character c in the input text. If the character c is lowercase, it appends it to the short string. Finally, it returns the short string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '980jio80jic kld094398IIl ', we need to iterate over each character in the input and append the lowercase characters to the short string. The lowercase characters in the input are 'j', 'i', 'o', 'j', 'i', 'c', 'k', 'l', 'd', 'l'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '980jio80jic kld094398IIl ' is 'jiojickldl'.
<<<Output>>>
'jiojickldl'
