<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two dictionaries, a and b, as input and returns a new dictionary that is the result of merging the two dictionaries using the ** operator.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'w': 5, 'wi': 10} and {'w': 3}, we need to merge the two dictionaries.
When merging dictionaries, if there are keys that are common between the two dictionaries, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first dictionary.
In this case, the key 'w' is common between the two dictionaries, and the value from the second dictionary {'w': 3} will overwrite the value from the first dictionary {'w': 5, 'wi': 10}.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'w': 5, 'wi': 10} and {'w': 3} is {'w': 3, 'wi': 10}.
<<<Output>>>
{'w': 3, 'wi': 10}
