<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a modified version of the input string.
The function first initializes an empty list called new_text.
Then, it iterates over each character in the input string.
If the character is uppercase, it inserts the character at the middle position of the new_text list.
After iterating through all the characters, if the new_text list is still empty, it assigns a list containing a single hyphen '-' to new_text.
Finally, it joins all the characters in the new_text list into a single string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.', we need to analyze each step of the code:

1. Initialize new_text as an empty list: []

2. Iterate over each character in the input string:
   - 'S' is uppercase, so insert it at the middle position of new_text: ['S']
   - 't' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'r' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'i' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'n' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'g' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - ' ' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'm' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'a' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 't' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'c' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'h' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'i' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'n' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'g' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - ' ' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'i' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 's' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - ' ' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'a' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - ' ' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'b' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'i' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'g' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - ' ' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'p' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'a' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'r' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 't' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - ' ' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'o' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'f' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - ' ' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'R' is uppercase, so insert it at the middle position of new_text: ['S', 'R']
   - 'e' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'x' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'E' is uppercase, so insert it at the middle position of new_text: ['S', 'E', 'R']
   - 'x' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - ' ' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'l' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'i' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'b' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'r' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'a' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'r' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - 'y' is not uppercase, so skip it
   - '.' is not uppercase, so skip it

3. The new_text list is not empty, so join all the characters in the new_text list into a single string: 'SER'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.' is 'SER'.
<<<Output>>>
'SER'
