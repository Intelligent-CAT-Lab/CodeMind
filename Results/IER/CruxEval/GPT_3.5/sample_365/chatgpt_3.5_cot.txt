<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: n and s. It checks if s starts with n using the startswith() method. If it does, it splits s into two parts: pre and _ (underscore is used as a throwaway variable). The split is done at the first occurrence of n. Then, it returns the concatenation of pre, n, and the remaining part of s after n. If s does not start with n, it simply returns s.

In this case, n is 'xqc' and s is 'mRcwVqXsRDRb'. Since s does not start with 'xqc', the function returns s as it is.

<<<Output>>>
'mRcwVqXsRDRb'
