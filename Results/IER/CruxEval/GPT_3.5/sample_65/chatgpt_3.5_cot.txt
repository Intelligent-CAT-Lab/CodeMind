<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers `nums` and an index `index` as input. 
First, it calculates the remainder of `nums[index]` divided by 42.
Then, it removes the element at index `index` from the list `nums` using the `pop()` method.
Finally, it multiplies the removed element by 2 and adds it to the remainder calculated earlier.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `[3, 2, 0, 3, 7]` and `3`, we need to follow these steps:
1. Calculate the remainder of `nums[3]` (which is 3) divided by 42. The remainder is 3.
2. Remove the element at index 3 from the list `nums`. The list becomes `[3, 2, 0, 7]`.
3. Multiply the removed element (which is 3) by 2. The result is 6.
4. Add the remainder (which is 3) to the multiplied element (which is 6). The result is 9.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `[3, 2, 0, 3, 7]` and `3` is 9.

9
