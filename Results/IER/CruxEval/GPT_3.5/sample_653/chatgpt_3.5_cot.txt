<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a string letter. 
It initializes a variable t with the value of text.
Then, it iterates over each character alph in the text and replaces all occurrences of alph in t with an empty string.
After the loop, it splits t using the letter as the delimiter and returns the length of the resulting list.

In this case, the input text is "c, c, c ,c, c" and the input letter is "c".
The function will replace all occurrences of "c" in t with an empty string, resulting in t = ", ,  , , ".
Then, it splits t using the letter "c" as the delimiter, resulting in a list with 5 empty strings.
Finally, it returns the length of this list, which is 5.

<<<Output>>>
5
