<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and char. It first calculates the length of the text and initializes the index variable to -1. Then, it iterates over each character in the text using a for loop. If the current character is equal to the given char, it updates the index variable to the current index. After the loop, if the index is still -1, it means the char was not found in the text, so it sets the index to the middle index of the text (length // 2). 

Next, it converts the text into a list of characters using the list() function. It then removes the character at the index position from the list using the pop() method. Finally, it joins the remaining characters in the list back into a string using the ''.join() method and returns the result.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'o horseto' with char 'r', we need to go through the code step by step:
1. The length of the text is 10.
2. The index is initially -1.
3. The loop iterates over each character in the text. When it reaches the character 'r' at index 4, it updates the index to 4.
4. After the loop, the index is still 4.
5. The text is converted into a list: ['o', ' ', 'h', 'o', 'r', 's', 'e', 't', 'o'].
6. The character at index 4 ('r') is removed from the list.
7. The remaining characters in the list are joined back into a string: 'o hseto'.
8. The resulting string is returned.

<<<Output>>>
'o hseto'
