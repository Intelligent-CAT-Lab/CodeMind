<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three inputs: text, suffix, and num. It first converts the integer num to a string using the str() function and assigns it to the variable str_num. Then, it checks if the concatenation of suffix and str_num is a suffix of the text using the endswith() method. The endswith() method returns True if the text ends with the specified suffix, and False otherwise.

In this case, the input text is "friends and love", the suffix is "and", and the num is 3. The function will convert 3 to the string "3" and check if the text ends with "and3". Since "friends and love" does not end with "and3", the function will return False.

<<<Output>>>
False
