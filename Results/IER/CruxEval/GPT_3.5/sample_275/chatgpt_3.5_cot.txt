<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary dic as input and creates a new dictionary dic2 by swapping the keys and values of dic using the zip() function and the dict() constructor.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {-1: "a", 0: "b", 1: "c"}, we need to swap the keys and values of the dictionary.
After swapping, the new dictionary dic2 will have the keys as the values of dic and the values as the keys of dic.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {-1: "a", 0: "b", 1: "c"} is {"a": -1, "b": 0, "c": 1}.
<<<Output>>>
{"a": -1, "b": 0, "c": 1}
