The function f takes three inputs: text, substr, and occ. It initializes a variable n to 0. Then, it enters a while loop that continues indefinitely.

Inside the while loop, it finds the last occurrence of the substring substr in the text using the rfind() method. If no occurrence is found, it breaks out of the loop. If the number of occurrences n is equal to the specified occ, it returns the index i of the last occurrence. Otherwise, it increments n by 1 and updates the text to be the substring before the last occurrence.

If the while loop completes without finding the specified number of occurrences, it returns -1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'zjegiymjc', 'j', 2, we need to step through the code:

1. Initialize n = 0.
2. Enter the while loop.
3. Find the last occurrence of 'j' in 'zjegiymjc'. The index of the last occurrence is 7.
4. Since n (0) is not equal to occ (2), increment n by 1 and update text to be 'zjegiym'.
5. Enter the while loop again.
6. Find the last occurrence of 'j' in 'zjegiym'. The index of the last occurrence is 4.
7. Since n (1) is not equal to occ (2), increment n by 1 and update text to be 'zje'.
8. Enter the while loop again.
9. Find the last occurrence of 'j' in 'zje'. The index of the last occurrence is -1.
10. Since no occurrence is found, break out of the loop.
11. Return -1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'zjegiymjc', 'j', 2 is -1.
