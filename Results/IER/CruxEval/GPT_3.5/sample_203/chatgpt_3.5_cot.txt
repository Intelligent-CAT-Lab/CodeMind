<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input. It first clears the dictionary using the clear() method, which removes all the key-value pairs from the dictionary. Then it returns the cleared dictionary.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 3, 'b': -1, 'c': 'Dum'}, we need to clear the dictionary and return it.
After clearing the dictionary, it becomes an empty dictionary {}.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 3, 'b': -1, 'c': 'Dum'} is {}.
<<<Output>>>
