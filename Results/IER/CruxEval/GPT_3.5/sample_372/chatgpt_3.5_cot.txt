<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a list and a number. It initializes an empty list called temp. Then, it iterates over each element i in the input list. Inside the loop, it performs the following steps:
1. It calculates the value of num // 2 and multiplies it with the string '%s,' % i. This operation concatenates the string representation of i with a comma.
2. It appends the result of the above step to the temp list.
After iterating over all elements in the input list, the function returns the temp list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['v'], 1, we need to follow the steps mentioned above:
1. The input list has only one element 'v'.
2. The value of num // 2 is 0 (integer division of 1 by 2).
3. The result of multiplying 0 with the string 'v,' is an empty string ''.
4. The empty string is appended to the temp list.
5. The function returns the temp list, which contains one element: [''].
