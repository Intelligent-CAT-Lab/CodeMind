<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three numbers as input and creates a list called nums with these numbers. Then, it sorts the list in ascending order. Finally, it returns a string representation of the sorted list, with the numbers separated by commas.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (6, 8, 8), we need to follow these steps:
1. Create a list nums with the numbers [6, 8, 8].
2. Sort the list nums in ascending order, resulting in [6, 8, 8].
3. Convert the sorted list to a string representation with commas, resulting in "6,8,8".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (6, 8, 8) is "6,8,8".
<<<Output>>>
'6,8,8'
