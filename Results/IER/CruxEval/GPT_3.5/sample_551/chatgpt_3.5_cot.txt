The function f takes a dictionary data as input. It initializes an empty list called members. Then, it iterates over each key in the dictionary using the variable item. Inside this loop, it iterates over each element in the list associated with the current key using the variable member. If the member is not already in the members list, it appends it to the list. Finally, it returns the sorted members list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'inf': ['a', 'b'], 'a': ["inf", "c"], 'd': ["inf"]}, we need to go through the code step by step:

1. Initialize members as an empty list.
2. Iterate over each key in the dictionary:
   - For the key 'inf', iterate over each element in the list ['a', 'b']:
     - Check if 'a' is not in members (it is not), so append 'a' to members.
     - Check if 'b' is not in members (it is not), so append 'b' to members.
   - For the key 'a', iterate over each element in the list ['inf', 'c']:
     - Check if 'inf' is not in members (it is not), so append 'inf' to members.
     - Check if 'c' is not in members (it is not), so append 'c' to members.
   - For the key 'd', iterate over each element in the list ['inf']:
     - Check if 'inf' is not in members (it is), so do not append it to members.
3. Return the sorted members list: ['a', 'b', 'c'].

<<<Output>>>
['a', 'b', 'c']
