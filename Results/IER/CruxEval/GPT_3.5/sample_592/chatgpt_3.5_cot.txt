<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list that contains the numbers in reverse order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [11, 3], we need to iterate over the input list and append each number to a new list in reverse order.
In the first iteration, i=0 and the number to be appended is numbers[len(numbers)-1-0] = numbers[1] = 3.
In the second iteration, i=1 and the number to be appended is numbers[len(numbers)-1-1] = numbers[0] = 11.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [11, 3] is [3, 11].
<<<Output>>>
[3, 11]
