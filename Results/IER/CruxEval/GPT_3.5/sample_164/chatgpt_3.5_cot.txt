<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input. 
First, the function sorts the list in ascending order using the sort() method.
Then, it returns a slice of the sorted list from index 0 to index 3 (exclusive).
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 1, 3, 0], we need to sort the list and then take a slice from index 0 to index 3.
After sorting the list, it becomes [0, 1, 3, 5, 8].
Taking a slice from index 0 to index 3 (exclusive) gives us [0, 1, 3].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 1, 3, 0] is [0, 1, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 3]
