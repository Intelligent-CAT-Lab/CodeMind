<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: values, text, and markers. It first removes any trailing characters from the string text that are present in the string values using the rstrip() method. Then, it removes any trailing characters from the resulting string that are present in the string markers using the rstrip() method again. Finally, it returns the resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '2Pn', 'yCxpg2C2Pny2', '', we need to follow these steps:
1. Remove any trailing characters from 'yCxpg2C2Pny2' that are present in '2Pn'. This results in the string 'yCxpg2C'.
2. Remove any trailing characters from 'yCxpg2C' that are present in ''. Since there are no markers specified, this step does not change the string.
3. The resulting string is 'yCxpg2C'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '2Pn', 'yCxpg2C2Pny2', '' is 'yCxpg2C'.
<<<Output>>>
'yCxpg2C'
