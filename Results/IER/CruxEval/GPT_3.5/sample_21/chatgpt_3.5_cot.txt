<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list called array as input. 
First, it removes the last element of the list using the pop() method and assigns it to the variable n.
Then, it extends the list by adding the elements n and n at the end using the extend() method.
Finally, it returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 2, 2], we need to follow these steps:
1. Remove the last element of the list, which is 2, and assign it to the variable n.
2. Extend the list by adding the elements n and n at the end, resulting in [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2].
3. Return the modified list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 2, 2] is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]
