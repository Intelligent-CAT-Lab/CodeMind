The function f takes a list of elements nums as input. It initializes an empty list called digits. Then, it iterates over each element num in nums. If num is a string and it is numeric (checked using the isnumeric() method) or if num is an integer, it appends num to the digits list. After that, it converts each element in digits to an integer using the map() function and assigns the result back to digits. Finally, it returns the digits list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, '1', '2', 0], we need to go through the code step by step:
1. Initialize digits as an empty list.
2. Iterate over each element in nums:
   - For the first element 0, it is an integer, so it is appended to digits.
   - For the second element 6, it is an integer, so it is appended to digits.
   - For the third element '1', it is a string and numeric, so it is appended to digits.
   - For the fourth element '2', it is a string and numeric, so it is appended to digits.
   - For the fifth element 0, it is an integer, so it is appended to digits.
3. Convert each element in digits to an integer using the map() function and assign the result back to digits. Since all elements in digits are already integers, the list remains unchanged.
4. Return the digits list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, '1', '2', 0] is [0, 6, 1, 2, 0].
