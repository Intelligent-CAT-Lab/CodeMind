The function f takes a string s as input and returns the index of the last occurrence of a substring in s. 
The function initializes two empty strings b and c. 
Then, it iterates over each character i in the input string s. 
In each iteration, it appends the current character i to the string c. 
Then, it checks if the substring c exists in the input string s using the rfind() method. 
If the substring c is found in s, it returns the index of the last occurrence of c in s using the rfind() method. 
If the substring c is not found in s, it continues to the next iteration. 
If the loop completes without finding any occurrence of the substring c, it returns 0. 

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'papeluchis', we need to analyze the code step by step:
1. Initialize b as an empty string: b = ''
2. Initialize c as an empty string: c = ''
3. Iterate over each character i in the input string 'papeluchis':
   - In the first iteration, i = 'p'. Append 'p' to c: c = 'p'
   - Check if 'p' is a substring of 'papeluchis'. Since 'p' is found at index 0, return 0.
   - The function ends here and the output is 0.
