<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, text and value. It uses the ljust() method of the text string to left justify the text string with a width equal to the length of the value string. The remaining space is filled with the character "?".
In this case, the text string is "!?" and the value string is an empty string "". The length of the value string is 0, so the text string will be left justified with a width of 0 and filled with "?".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "!?" and "" is "!?".
<<<Output>>>
'!?'
