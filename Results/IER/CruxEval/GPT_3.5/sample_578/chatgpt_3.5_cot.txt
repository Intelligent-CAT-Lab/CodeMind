<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary obj as input. It iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary. If the value is greater than or equal to 0, it negates the value by multiplying it by -1. Finally, it returns the modified dictionary obj.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'R': 0, 'T': 3, 'F': -6, 'K': 0}, we need to iterate over each key-value pair in the dictionary and check if the value is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, we need to negate the value.

In this case, the value of 'R' is 0, so it will be negated to -0. The value of 'T' is 3, so it will be negated to -3. The value of 'F' is -6, so it will not be negated. The value of 'K' is 0, so it will be negated to -0.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'R': 0, 'T': 3, 'F': -6, 'K': 0} is {'R': -0, 'T': -3, 'F': -6, 'K': -0}.
<<<Output>>>
{'R': -0, 'T': -3, 'F': -6, 'K': -0}
