<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input. 
First, it creates a copy of the original list nums using the slicing operation nums[:]. 
Then, it iterates over each element odd in the copied list. 
If the element odd is odd (i.e., odd % 2 != 0), it removes the element odd from the copied list using the remove() method. 
After that, it initializes a variable sum_ to 0. 
Then, it iterates over each element num in the modified list nums. 
For each element num, it adds num to the variable sum_. 
Finally, it returns the value of sum_.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [11, 21, 0, 11], we need to follow these steps:
1. Create a copy of the original list: [11, 21, 0, 11]
2. Iterate over each element in the copied list:
   - For the first element 11, it is odd, so remove it from the copied list. The copied list becomes [21, 0, 11].
   - For the second element 21, it is odd, so remove it from the copied list. The copied list becomes [0, 11].
   - For the third element 0, it is even, so keep it in the copied list.
   - For the fourth element 11, it is odd, so remove it from the copied list. The copied list becomes [0].
3. Initialize sum_ to 0.
4. Iterate over each element in the modified list [0]:
   - For the element 0, add it to sum_. sum_ becomes 0 + 0 = 0.
5. Return the value of sum_, which is 0.
