<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: items and target. 
It splits the items string into a list of words using the split() method.
Then, it iterates over each word in the list.
If the word is present in the target string, it returns the index of the word in the original items string plus 1.
If the word contains a dot (.) at the beginning or at the end, it returns 'error'.
If none of the above conditions are met, it returns '.'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the given inputs, we need to analyze each step:
1. Splitting the items string: ["qy.", "dg.", "rnvprt", "rse..", "irtwv", "tx.."]
2. Iterating over each word:
   - For "qy.", it is not present in the target string.
   - For "dg.", it is not present in the target string.
   - For "rnvprt", it is not present in the target string.
   - For "rse..", it is not present in the target string.
   - For "irtwv", it is not present in the target string.
   - For "tx..", it is not present in the target string.
3. Since none of the words are present in the target string, the function returns '.'.

<<<Output>>>
'.'
