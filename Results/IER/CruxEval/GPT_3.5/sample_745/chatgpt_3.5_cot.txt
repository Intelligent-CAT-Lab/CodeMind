The function f takes an email address as input and removes the domain suffix from it. 
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'minimc@minimc.io', we need to follow these steps:
1. Find the index of the '@' symbol in the email address.
2. Add 1 to the index to get the starting index of the domain suffix.
3. Count the number of '.' characters in the domain suffix.
4. If the count is greater than 1, remove the domain suffix from the email address.
5. Return the modified email address.

In this case, the index of '@' is 6. So, the starting index of the domain suffix is 7.
The domain suffix is 'minimc.io' and it contains only one '.' character.
Therefore, the domain suffix is not removed from the email address.
The output of executing the function f on the input 'minimc@minimc.io' is 'minimc@minimc.io'.
<<<Output>>>
'minimc@minimc.io'
