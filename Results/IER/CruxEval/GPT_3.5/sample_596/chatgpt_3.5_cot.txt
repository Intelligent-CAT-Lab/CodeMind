<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a list of strings txt and a string alpha. 
First, the function sorts the list txt in ascending order. 
Then, it checks the index of the string alpha in the sorted list txt. 
If the index is even (i.e., divisible by 2), it returns the reversed list txt. 
Otherwise, it returns the sorted list txt as is. 

In this case, the input list txt is ['8', '9', '7', '4', '3', '2'] and the input string alpha is '9'. 
After sorting the list txt, it becomes ['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9']. 
The index of '9' in the sorted list is 5, which is odd. 
Therefore, the function will return the sorted list txt as is. 

<<<Output>>>
['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9']
