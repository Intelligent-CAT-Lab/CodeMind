<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a dictionary d and a list l. It creates an empty dictionary new_d. Then, for each key k in the list l, it checks if the key exists in the dictionary d using the get() method. If the key exists, it adds the key-value pair to the new_d dictionary. Finally, it returns a copy of the new_d dictionary.

In this case, the input dictionary is {"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23} and the input list is ["lorem ipsum", "dolor"]. The function will iterate over each key in the list and check if it exists in the dictionary. Both "lorem ipsum" and "dolor" exist in the dictionary, so they will be added to the new_d dictionary. The new_d dictionary will have the same key-value pairs as the input dictionary.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input is {"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}.
<<<Output>>>
{"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}
