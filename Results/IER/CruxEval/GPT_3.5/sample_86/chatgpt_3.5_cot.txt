<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three inputs: instagram, imgur, and wins. It creates a list called photos with the values of instagram and imgur. 
If instagram is equal to imgur, the function returns the value of wins.
If wins is equal to 1, the function removes and returns the last element of the photos list.
Otherwise, the function reverses the order of the elements in the photos list and removes and returns the last element.
In this case, the input values are ['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e'] for instagram, ['sdfs', 'dr2c', 'QWERTY'] for imgur, and 0 for wins.
The photos list will be ['sdfs', 'drcr'].
Since instagram is not equal to imgur, the function moves to the next condition.
Since wins is not equal to 1, the function reverses the order of the elements in the photos list, resulting in ['drcr', 'sdfs'].
The function then removes and returns the last element of the photos list, which is 'sdfs'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input is 'sdfs'.
<<<Output>>>
'sdfs'
