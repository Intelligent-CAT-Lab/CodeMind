<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an empty dictionary `array` and an integer `elem`. 
The function creates a copy of the `array` and enters a while loop that continues until the `result` dictionary is empty. 
Inside the loop, the function pops an item from the `result` dictionary and assigns its key and value to the variables `key` and `value`, respectively. 
If `elem` is equal to either the key or the value, the function updates the `result` dictionary with the original `array`. 
Then, it deletes the key from the `result` dictionary. 
After the loop ends, the function returns the `result` dictionary.

In this case, the `array` is an empty dictionary, so the while loop is never entered. 
Since there are no items in the `result` dictionary, it remains empty. 
Therefore, the return value of `f({}, 1)` is an empty dictionary.
