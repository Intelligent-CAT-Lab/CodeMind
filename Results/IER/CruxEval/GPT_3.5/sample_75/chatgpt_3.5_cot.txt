<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: an array and an element. 
First, it finds the index of the element in the array using the index() method.
Then, it multiplies the index by 2 and adds the product to the element at the index (-index - 1) in the array, multiplied by 3.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2] and 2, we need to find the index of 2 in the array, which is 1.
Then, we multiply 1 by 2 to get 2, and add it to the element at index (-1 - 1) in the array, which is -8, multiplied by 3, resulting in -8 * 3 = -24.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2] and 2 is -24.
<<<Output>>>
-24
