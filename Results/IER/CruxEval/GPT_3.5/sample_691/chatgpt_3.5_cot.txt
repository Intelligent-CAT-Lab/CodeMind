<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and suffix. It checks if the last character of the suffix is present in the text. If it is, it recursively calls the function f with the text stripped of the last character of the suffix and the suffix with the last character removed. If the last character of the suffix is not present in the text, it returns the text as is.

In this case, the input text is 'rpyttc' and the suffix is 'cyt'. The last character of the suffix, 't', is present in the text. So, the function f is called recursively with the text 'rpytt' (after stripping the last 't') and the suffix 'cy' (after removing the last 't'). 

In the next recursive call, the last character of the suffix, 'y', is also present in the text. So, the function f is called again with the text 'rpyt' (after stripping the last 'y') and the suffix 'c' (after removing the last 'y').

In the final recursive call, the last character of the suffix, 'c', is not present in the text. So, the else block is executed and the function returns the text 'rpyt' as is.

Therefore, the return value of f('rpyttc', 'cyt') is 'rpyt'.
<<<Output>>>
'rpyt'
