<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: playlist (a dictionary), liker_name (a string), and song_index (a string).
First, the function checks if liker_name is already a key in the playlist dictionary. If it is not, it adds liker_name as a key with an empty list as its value.
Next, it appends the song_index to the list associated with liker_name in the playlist dictionary.
Finally, it returns the updated playlist dictionary.

In this case, the input playlist is {'aki': ['1', '5']}, liker_name is 'aki', and song_index is '2'.
The function first checks if 'aki' is a key in the playlist dictionary, which it is. So it does not add a new key-value pair.
Then, it appends '2' to the list associated with 'aki' in the playlist dictionary, resulting in {'aki': ['1', '5', '2']}.
Finally, it returns the updated playlist dictionary.

<<<Output>>>
{'aki': ['1', '5', '2']}
