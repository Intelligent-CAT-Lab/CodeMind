The function f takes a list of integers ints as input. It initializes a list called counts with 301 elements, all set to 0. 

Then, it iterates over each element i in the input list ints and increments the count of that element in the counts list.

Next, it initializes an empty list called r. It then iterates over the range of the length of the counts list. For each index i, if the count of that element in the counts list is greater than or equal to 3, it appends the string representation of i to the list r.

After that, it clears the counts list and returns the joined elements of the list r, separated by a space.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89], we need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize the counts list with 301 elements, all set to 0.
2. Iterate over each element in the input list and increment the count of that element in the counts list.
   - counts = [0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, ..., 0] (updated counts list after iterating over the input list)
3. Initialize an empty list r.
4. Iterate over the range of the length of the counts list. For each index i, if the count of that element in the counts list is greater than or equal to 3, append the string representation of i to the list r.
   - r = ['2', '5'] (updated list r after iterating over the counts list)
5. Clear the counts list.
6. Return the joined elements of the list r, separated by a space.
   - '2 5'

<<<Output>>>
'2 5'
