<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string tokens as input and splits it into a list of strings using the split() method. In this case, the input "gsd avdropj" will be split into the list ['gsd', 'avdropj'].
Next, it checks if the length of the tokens list is equal to 2. In this case, the length is 2, so the if condition is True.
Inside the if condition, the tokens list is reversed using the reversed() function and converted back to a list using the list() function. So, the reversed list will be ['avdropj', 'gsd'].
Then, it joins the first two elements of the tokens list using the join() method and adds padding to each element using the ljust() method with a width of 5. So, the result will be 'avdropj gsd  '.
Finally, the result is returned.

<<<Output>>>
'avdropj gsd  '
