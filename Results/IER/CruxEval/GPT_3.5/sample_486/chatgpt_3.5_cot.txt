The function f takes a dictionary dic as input and creates a copy of it called dic_op. Then, it iterates over each key-value pair in dic and updates the corresponding value in dic_op by squaring it. Finally, it returns dic_op.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {1:1, 2:2, 3:3}, we need to perform the following steps:
1. Create a copy of the input dictionary: {1:1, 2:2, 3:3} -> {1:1, 2:2, 3:3}
2. Iterate over each key-value pair in the dictionary:
   - For key=1, val=1: Update dic_op[1] = 1 * 1 = 1
   - For key=2, val=2: Update dic_op[2] = 2 * 2 = 4
   - For key=3, val=3: Update dic_op[3] = 3 * 3 = 9
3. Return the updated dictionary: {1:1, 2:4, 3:9}

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {1:1, 2:2, 3:3} is {1:1, 2:4, 3:9}.
<<<Output>>>
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
