<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two lists, a and b, as input. It first creates a dictionary d by zipping the elements of a and b together. The keys of the dictionary are the elements of a and the values are the corresponding elements of b. 

Next, it sorts the list a based on the values in the dictionary d. The sorting is done in reverse order (from highest to lowest).

Finally, it returns a list comprehension that pops the values from the dictionary d based on the keys in the sorted list a.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['12','ab'] and [2,2], we need to follow these steps:

1. Create the dictionary d: {'12': 2, 'ab': 2}
2. Sort the list a based on the values in d: ['ab', '12']
3. Pop the values from d based on the keys in the sorted list a: [2, 2]

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['12','ab'] and [2,2] is [2, 2].
