The function f takes a sentence as input and converts it into a list of characters. Then, it iterates over each character in the list and checks if it is not a title case letter. If it is not a title case letter, it removes that character from the list. Finally, it joins the remaining characters in the list to form a string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'XYZ LittleRedRidingHood LiTTleBIGGeXEiT fault', we need to analyze the steps:

1. Convert the sentence into a list of characters: ['X', 'Y', 'Z', ' ', 'L', 'i', 't', 't', 'l', 'e', 'R', 'e', 'd', 'R', 'i', 'd', 'i', 'n', 'g', 'H', 'o', 'o', 'd', ' ', 'L', 'i', 'T', 'T', 'l', 'e', 'B', 'I', 'G', 'G', 'e', 'X', 'E', 'i', 'T', ' ', 'f', 'a', 'u', 'l', 't']
2. Iterate over each character in the list:
   - 'X' is a title case letter, so it is not removed.
   - 'Y' is a title case letter, so it is not removed.
   - 'Z' is a title case letter, so it is not removed.
   - ' ' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'L' is a title case letter, so it is not removed.
   - 'i' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 't' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 't' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'l' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'e' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'R' is a title case letter, so it is not removed.
   - 'e' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'd' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'R' is a title case letter, so it is not removed.
   - 'i' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'd' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'i' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'n' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'g' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'H' is a title case letter, so it is not removed.
   - 'o' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'o' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'd' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - ' ' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'L' is a title case letter, so it is not removed.
   - 'i' is not a title case letter, so it is removed.
   - 'T' is a title case letter, so it is not removed.
