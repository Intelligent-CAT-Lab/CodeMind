<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following steps:
1. It splits the string into a list of words using the split() method.
2. It iterates over each word in the list.
3. For each word, it replaces all occurrences of "-word" and "word-" in the original text with a space.
4. Finally, it strips any remaining "-" characters from the beginning and end of the text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-", we need to follow these steps:
1. Split the text into a list of words: ['-stew---corn-and-beans-in', 'soup-.']
2. Iterate over each word:
   - For the first word '-stew---corn-and-beans-in', replace all occurrences of "-stew---corn-and-beans-in" and "stew---corn-and-beans-in-" with a space. The text becomes ' soup-.'
   - For the second word 'soup-.', replace all occurrences of "-soup-." and "soup-.-" with a space. The text remains ' soup-.'
3. Strip any remaining "-" characters from the beginning and end of the text. The final output is ' soup.'.

<<<Output>>>
' soup.'
