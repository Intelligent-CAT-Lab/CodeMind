<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string ans as input. 
If ans is a decimal number, the function performs the following steps:
1. It multiplies the integer value of ans by 4 and subtracts 50 from the result.
2. It converts ans into a list of characters and filters out any characters that are not '0', '2', '4', '6', or '8'.
3. It calculates the length of the filtered list and multiplies it by 100.
4. It subtracts the result of step 3 from the result of step 1 and returns the final value.
If ans is not a decimal number, the function returns the string 'NAN'.

In this case, the input is '0', which is a decimal number. 
1. The function multiplies 0 by 4 and subtracts 50, resulting in -50.
2. The filtered list of characters is empty because '0' is in the allowed characters list.
3. The length of the filtered list is 0.
4. The function subtracts 0 from -50 and returns -50.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '0' is -50.

-50
