<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input: text and sub. It initializes an empty list called index and a variable called starting with the value 0. 

The function then enters a while loop that continues until starting is -1. Inside the loop, it uses the find() method to search for the first occurrence of sub in text, starting from the index specified by starting. If find() returns a value other than -1, it means that sub was found in text. In that case, the index of the found occurrence is appended to the index list, and starting is updated to the index immediately after the found occurrence by adding the length of sub to it.

If find() returns -1, it means that sub was not found in text, and the loop terminates.

Finally, the function returns the index list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'egmdartoa' and 'good', we need to step through the code:

1. starting = 0
2. starting = text.find('good', 0) -> -1 (sub not found)
3. Loop terminates
4. Return index -> []

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'egmdartoa' and 'good' is [].
