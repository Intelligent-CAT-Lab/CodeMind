<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input: string and prefix. 
It checks if the string starts with the prefix using the startswith() method. 
If it does, it removes the prefix from the string using the removeprefix() method and returns the result. 
If the string does not start with the prefix, it simply returns the original string. 

In this case, the input string is "Vipra" and the prefix is "via". 
Since the string does not start with the prefix "via", the function will return the original string "Vipra". 

<<<Output>>>
'Vipra'
