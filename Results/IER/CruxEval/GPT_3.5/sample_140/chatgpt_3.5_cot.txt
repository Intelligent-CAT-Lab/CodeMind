The function f takes a string st as input and performs the following steps:
1. It converts the string st to lowercase using the lower() method.
2. It finds the last occurrence of the letter 'i' in the lowercase string using the rindex() method.
3. It finds the last occurrence of the letter 'h' in the lowercase string, starting from the index of the last occurrence of 'i' found in the previous step.
4. It compares the index of the last occurrence of 'h' with the index of the last occurrence of 'i'. If the index of 'h' is greater than or equal to the index of 'i', it returns 'Hey'. Otherwise, it returns 'Hi'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'Hi there', we need to follow these steps:
1. Convert the string 'Hi there' to lowercase: 'hi there'.
2. Find the last occurrence of 'i' in 'hi there', which is at index 8.
3. Find the last occurrence of 'h' in 'hi there', starting from index 8. The last occurrence of 'h' is at index 1.
4. Compare the index of 'h' (1) with the index of 'i' (8). Since 1 is less than 8, the condition is not satisfied.
5. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'Hi there' is 'Hi'.

<<<Output>>>
'Hi'
