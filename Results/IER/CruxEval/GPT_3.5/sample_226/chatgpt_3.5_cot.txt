<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input. It iterates over each element in the list using a for loop. For each element, it checks if the element is divisible by 3 using the modulo operator (%). If the element is divisible by 3, it appends the element to the end of the list using the append() method. Finally, it returns the modified list.

In this case, the input list is [1, 3]. The function iterates over each element in the list. The first element 1 is not divisible by 3, so it is skipped. The second element 3 is divisible by 3, so it is appended to the end of the list. The modified list becomes [1, 3, 3]. Finally, the modified list [1, 3, 3] is returned as the output.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 3]
