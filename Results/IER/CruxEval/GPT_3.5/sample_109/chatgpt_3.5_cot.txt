<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: nums, spot, and idx. It inserts the value of idx at the position specified by spot in the list nums using the insert() method. Then, it returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 0, 1, 1], 0, 9, we need to insert the value 9 at the position 0 in the list [1, 0, 1, 1].
After inserting 9 at position 0, the modified list becomes [9, 1, 0, 1, 1].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 0, 1, 1], 0, 9 is [9, 1, 0, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[9, 1, 0, 1, 1]
