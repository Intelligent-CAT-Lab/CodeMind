The function f takes a string sample as input and returns the index of the last occurrence of '/' in the substring of sample from index 0 to index i, where i is the index of the last occurrence of '/' in the string sample.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'present/here/car%2Fwe', we need to find the index of the last occurrence of '/' in the substring 'present/here/car%2Fwe' from index 0 to index i, where i is the index of the last occurrence of '/' in the string 'present/here/car%2Fwe'.

The while loop in the function f iterates until the find method returns -1, which means there are no more occurrences of '/' in the substring. The find method is called with the arguments '/', i+1, which means it starts searching for '/' from index i+1 onwards. The initial value of i is -1, so the first occurrence of '/' is found at index 7.

After finding the first occurrence of '/', the value of i is updated to 7. The find method is called again with the arguments '/', i+1, which means it starts searching for '/' from index 8 onwards. Since there are no more occurrences of '/', the find method returns -1.

The return statement in the function f calls the rindex method on the string sample with the arguments '/', 0, i. The rindex method returns the index of the last occurrence of '/' in the substring of sample from index 0 to index i. In this case, the index of the last occurrence of '/' in the substring 'present/here/car%2Fwe' from index 0 to index 7 is 7.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'present/here/car%2Fwe' is 7.
