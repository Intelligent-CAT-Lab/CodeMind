<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and performs the following steps:
1. It calculates the value of zero_len as (len(array) - 1) % 3. In this case, zero_len will be 1.
2. It then enters a for loop that iterates over the range of zero_len, which is 1. In this case, the loop will execute once.
   - In the first iteration, it sets array[0] to '0'.
3. It then enters another for loop that iterates over the range starting from zero_len + 1 (2 in this case) and ending at the length of the array, with a step size of 3.
   - In this case, the loop will not execute as the length of the array is 2 and the range starts from 2.
4. Finally, it returns the modified array.
   - In this case, the modified array will be [0, 2].

<<<Output>>>
[0, 2]
