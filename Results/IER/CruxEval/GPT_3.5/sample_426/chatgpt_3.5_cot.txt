<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: numbers (a list), elem (an element to be inserted), and idx (the index at which the element should be inserted).
The function first inserts the element elem at the specified index idx using the insert() method of the list.
Then, it returns the modified list.

In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3], the element to be inserted is 8, and the index is 5.
Since the index 5 is greater than the length of the list (which is 3), the element will be inserted at the end of the list.
Therefore, the modified list will be [1, 2, 3, 8].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 8]
