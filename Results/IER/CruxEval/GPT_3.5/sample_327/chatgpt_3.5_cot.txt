<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and returns a new list new. 
It initializes an empty list new and a variable i with the value of len(lst)-1.
Then, it enters a for loop that iterates len(lst) times.
Inside the loop, it checks if i%2 is equal to 0. If it is, it appends -lst[i] to the new list. Otherwise, it appends lst[i] to the new list.
After each iteration, it decrements the value of i by 1.
Finally, it returns the new list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 7, -1, -3], we need to go through the steps of the code:
1. Initialize new as an empty list: []
2. Initialize i as len(lst)-1 = 3
3. Enter the for loop:
   - Iteration 1: i%2 = 3%2 = 1, append lst[i] = lst[3] = -3 to new: [-3]
   - Iteration 2: i%2 = 2%2 = 0, append -lst[i] = -lst[2] = -(-1) = 1 to new: [-3, 1]
   - Iteration 3: i%2 = 1%2 = 1, append lst[i] = lst[1] = 7 to new: [-3, 1, 7]
   - Iteration 4: i%2 = 0%2 = 0, append -lst[i] = -lst[0] = -(1) = -1 to new: [-3, 1, 7, -1]
4. Decrement i by 1: i = 2
5. Exit the for loop
6. Return new: [-3, 1, 7, -1]

<<<Output>>>
[-3, 1, 7, -1]
