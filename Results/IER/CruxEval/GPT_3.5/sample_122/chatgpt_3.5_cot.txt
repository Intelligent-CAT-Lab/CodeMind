<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input. 
It checks if the first 4 characters of the string are not equal to 'Nuva'. If they are not equal, it returns 'no'.
If the first 4 characters are equal to 'Nuva', it removes any trailing whitespace from the string using the rstrip() method and returns the modified string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'Nuva?dlfuyjys', we need to check if the first 4 characters are equal to 'Nuva'. In this case, they are not equal, so the function will return 'no'.
<<<Output>>>
'no'
