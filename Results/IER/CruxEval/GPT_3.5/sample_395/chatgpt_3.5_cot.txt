<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and iterates over each character in the string. 
If the character is a decimal digit, it returns the index of the character plus 1 if the character is '0', otherwise it returns just the index of the character.
If the character is '0', it returns -1.
If none of the characters in the string are decimal digits or '0', it returns -1.

In the given input "11", both characters are decimal digits, so the function will return the index of the first character plus 1, which is 1+1=2.
