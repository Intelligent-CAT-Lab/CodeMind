<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a sentence as input and performs the following steps:
1. If the sentence is an empty string, it returns an empty string.
2. It removes all occurrences of '(' and ')' from the sentence.
3. It capitalizes the first letter of the sentence.
4. It removes all spaces from the sentence.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "(A (b B))", we need to follow these steps:
1. Remove all occurrences of '(' and ')' from the sentence: "A b B"
2. Capitalize the first letter of the sentence: "A b B"
3. Remove all spaces from the sentence: "AbB"

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "(A (b B))" is "AbB".
