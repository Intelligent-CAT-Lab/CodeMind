<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string doc as input and iterates over each character in the string. If the character is alphabetic, it returns the capitalized version of that character. If no alphabetic character is found, it returns '-'.
In this case, the input is 'raruwa'. The function will iterate over each character in the string. The first alphabetic character it encounters is 'r'. It will capitalize 'r' and return it as the output.
Therefore, the return value of f('raruwa') is 'R'.
<<<Output>>>
'R'
