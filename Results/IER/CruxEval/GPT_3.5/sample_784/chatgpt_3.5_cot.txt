<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, key and value. It creates a dictionary dict_ with key as the key and value as the value. Then it calls the popitem() method on the dictionary dict_ and returns the result.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('read', 'Is'), we need to create a dictionary with key as 'read' and value as 'Is'. Then we call the popitem() method on the dictionary, which removes and returns an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('read', 'Is') is ('read', 'Is').
<<<Output>>>
('read', 'Is')
