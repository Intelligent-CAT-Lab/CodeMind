<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and checks if it contains a comma ','. If it does, it uses the partition() method to split the text into three parts: before the comma, the comma itself, and after the comma. It then returns the concatenation of after, a space ' ', and before.
If the text does not contain a comma, it uses the partition() method to split the text into three parts: before the first space, the first space itself, and after the first space. It then returns the concatenation of ',', the last part of the partitioned text, and ' 0'.

In this case, the input text is '244, 105, -90'. The function will find the first comma and split the text into three parts: '244', ',', and ' 105, -90'. It will then return the concatenation of ' 105, -90', a space ' ', and '244', resulting in ' 105, -90 244'.

<<<Output>>>
' 105, -90 244'
