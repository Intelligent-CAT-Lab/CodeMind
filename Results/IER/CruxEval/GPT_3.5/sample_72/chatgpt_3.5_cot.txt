<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and iterates over each character in the string. If any character is not numeric, the function immediately returns False. If all characters are numeric, the function returns the boolean value of the string itself.

In this case, the input is '99'. Both characters in the string are numeric, so the function will not encounter a non-numeric character and will return the boolean value of the string '99', which is True.

<<<Output>>>
True
