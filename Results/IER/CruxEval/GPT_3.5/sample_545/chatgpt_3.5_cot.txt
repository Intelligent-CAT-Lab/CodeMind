<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array that contains every second element of the input array in reverse order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8], we need to iterate over the input array and append every second element to the result array in reverse order.
The initial value of the result array is an empty array, and the initial value of the index variable is 0.
In the first iteration, the index is less than the length of the array, so we append the last element of the array (-1) to the result array and increment the index by 2.
In the second iteration, the index is still less than the length of the array, so we append the second last element of the array (8) to the result array and increment the index by 2.
In the third iteration, the index is still less than the length of the array, so we append the third last element of the array (2) to the result array and increment the index by 2.
In the fourth iteration, the index is still less than the length of the array, so we append the fourth last element of the array (-9) to the result array and increment the index by 2.
Since the index is now greater than or equal to the length of the array, the while loop terminates and we return the result array, which is [-1, 8, 2, -9].

[-1, 8, 2, -9]
