<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string name as input and splits it into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter. Then, it joins the words in the list using the asterisk character as the separator.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'Fred Smith', we need to split the string into a list of words ['Fred', 'Smith'] and then join them using the asterisk character as the separator.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'Fred Smith' is 'Fred*Smith'.
<<<Output>>>
'Fred*Smith'
