<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string txt as input and initializes an empty dictionary called coincidences. It then iterates over each character c in the input string txt. For each character, it checks if it already exists as a key in the coincidences dictionary. If it does, it increments the value associated with that key by 1. If it doesn't, it adds the character as a new key in the dictionary with a value of 1.

In this case, the input string is "11 1 1". Let's go step by step:
- The first character is "1". Since the coincidences dictionary is empty, the function adds "1" as a new key with a value of 1.
- The second character is "1". The coincidences dictionary already has "1" as a key, so the function increments the value associated with that key by 1. Now the value for the key "1" is 2.
- The third character is a space " ". The coincidences dictionary doesn't have a key for a space, so the function adds a new key " " with a value of 1.
- The fourth character is "1". The coincidences dictionary already has "1" as a key, so the function increments the value associated with that key by 1. Now the value for the key "1" is 3.
- The fifth character is a space " ". The coincidences dictionary already has a key for a space, so the function increments the value associated with that key by 1. Now the value for the key " " is 2.
- The sixth character is "1". The coincidences dictionary already has "1" as a key, so the function increments the value associated with that key by 1. Now the value for the key "1" is 4.

After iterating over all the characters in the input string, the function returns the sum of all the values in the coincidences dictionary. In this case, the sum is 4 + 2 + 2 = 8.
