The function f takes a list xs as input and performs the following steps:
1. It iterates over the range from -1 to -len(xs)-1 with a step of -1.
2. For each iteration, it extends the list xs with the elements xs[i] and xs[i].
3. Finally, it returns the modified list xs.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 8, 5], we need to go through the steps mentioned above.

1. The range from -1 to -len(xs)-1 with a step of -1 is [-1, -2, -3, -4].
2. In the first iteration, xs[-1] is 5, so the list xs is extended with [5, 5].
   After the first iteration, xs becomes [4, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5].
3. In the second iteration, xs[-2] is 8, so the list xs is extended with [8, 8].
   After the second iteration, xs becomes [4, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8].
4. In the third iteration, xs[-3] is 8, so the list xs is extended with [8, 8].
   After the third iteration, xs becomes [4, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8].
5. In the fourth iteration, xs[-4] is 4, so the list xs is extended with [4, 4].
   After the fourth iteration, xs becomes [4, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 8, 5] is [4, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4].
