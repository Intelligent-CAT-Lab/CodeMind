<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string that is formed by moving the last character of the input string to the front.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'hellomyfriendear', we need to move the last character 'r' to the front and concatenate it with the remaining characters 'hellomyfriendea'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'hellomyfriendear' is 'rhellomyfriendea'.
<<<Output>>>
'rhellomyfriendea'
