<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and converts it into a list of characters. Then, it iterates over the string '+'. Since '+' is not present in the input string, the loop does not execute any iterations. Finally, the function joins the characters in the list back into a string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'hbtofdeiequ', we need to remove any occurrences of '+' from the input string. However, since '+' is not present in the input string, the function does not modify the input string. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'hbtofdeiequ' is 'hbtofdeiequ'.

<<<Output>>>
'hbtofdeiequ'
