<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a string digit. 
The function counts the number of occurrences of the digit in the text using the count() method.
Then, it multiplies the count by the integer value of the digit using the int() function.
Finally, it returns the result of the multiplication.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '7Ljnw4Lj' and '7', we need to count the number of occurrences of '7' in '7Ljnw4Lj' and multiply it by 7.

The count of '7' in '7Ljnw4Lj' is 1.
Multiplying 1 by 7 gives us the output 7.

<<<Output>>>
7
