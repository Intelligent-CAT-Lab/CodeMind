<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string phrase as input and initializes a variable ans to 0. 
Then, it splits the phrase into words using the split() method and iterates over each word in the phrase.
For each word, it iterates over each character in the word and checks if the character is equal to "0".
If the character is equal to "0", it increments the ans variable by 1.
Finally, it returns the value of ans.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "aboba 212 has 0 digits", we need to count the number of occurrences of the character "0" in the input string.
The input string contains the word "0" once, so the output of executing the function f on the input "aboba 212 has 0 digits" is 1.
