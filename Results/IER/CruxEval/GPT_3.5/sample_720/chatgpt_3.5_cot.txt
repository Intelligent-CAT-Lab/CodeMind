The function f takes two arguments: items (a list) and item (a string). 
The function first enters a while loop that checks if the last element of the list items is equal to the string item. If it is, the last element is removed using the pop() method. This process continues until the last element is not equal to item.
After the while loop, the function appends the string item to the list items using the append() method.
Finally, the function returns the length of the modified list items using the len() function.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the given input, we need to step through the code:
1. The input string 'bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf' is split into a list of substrings using the split('-') method. Since there are no '-' characters in the input string, the entire string is considered as a single element in the list.
2. The while loop is entered because the last element of the list ('bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf') is equal to the string 'n'.
3. The last element is removed from the list using the pop() method, resulting in an empty list.
4. The string 'n' is appended to the list using the append() method, resulting in a list with a single element: ['n'].
5. The length of the list is calculated using the len() function, which is 1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input is 1.
