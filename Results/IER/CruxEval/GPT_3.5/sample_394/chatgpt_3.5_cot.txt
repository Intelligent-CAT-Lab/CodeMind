<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following steps:
1. It splits the input string into a list of lines using the splitlines() method. In this case, the input string "2 m2 \n\nbike" will be split into the list ['2 m2 ', '', 'bike'].
2. It initializes a variable i to 0.
3. It iterates over each line in the list.
4. For each line, it checks if the length of the line is 0. If it is, it means that the line is empty and the function returns the value of i.
5. If the length of the line is not 0, it increments the value of i by 1.
6. If the loop completes without finding an empty line, it returns -1.

In this case, the input string "2 m2 \n\nbike" has an empty line after the first line. Therefore, the function will return the value of i, which is 1.
