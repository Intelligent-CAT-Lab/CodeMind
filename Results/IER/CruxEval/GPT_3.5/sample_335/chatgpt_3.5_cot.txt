<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: text and to_remove. It first converts the text into a list of characters. Then, it checks if the to_remove character is present in the list. If it is, it finds the index of the to_remove character and replaces it with a question mark '?'. Finally, it removes the question mark and returns the modified list as a string.

In this case, the input text is 'sjbrlfqmw' and the to_remove character is 'l'. The function will convert the text into a list ['s', 'j', 'b', 'r', 'l', 'f', 'q', 'm', 'w']. Since 'l' is present in the list, it will find its index, which is 4. It will then replace 'l' with '?', resulting in the list ['s', 'j', 'b', 'r', '?', 'f', 'q', 'm', 'w']. Finally, it will remove the question mark and return the modified list as a string, which is 'sjbr?fqmw'.

<<<Output>>>
'sjbr?fqmw'
