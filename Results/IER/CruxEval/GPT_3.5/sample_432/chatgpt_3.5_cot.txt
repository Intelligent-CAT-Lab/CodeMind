<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: length and text. It first checks if the length of the text is equal to the given length. If it is, it returns the reverse of the text. Otherwise, it returns False.

In this case, the length is -5 and the text is 'G5ogb6f,c7e.EMm'. Since the length is not equal to the length of the text, the function will return False.

<<<Output>>>
False
