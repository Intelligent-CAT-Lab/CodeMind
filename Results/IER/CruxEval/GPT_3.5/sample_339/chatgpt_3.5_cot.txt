<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: an array and an element. It first converts the element to a string. Then, it initializes a variable d to 0. It then iterates over each element i in the array. If the string representation of i is equal to the string representation of the input element, it increments d by 1. Finally, it returns the value of d.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2] and 2, we need to iterate over each element in the array and check if it is equal to the input element (2). In this case, the elements 2 and 2 match the input element, so d will be incremented by 2. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2] and 2 is 2.
