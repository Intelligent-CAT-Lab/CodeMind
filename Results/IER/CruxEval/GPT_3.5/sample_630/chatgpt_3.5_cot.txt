<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two dictionaries as input: original and string. It creates a new dictionary called temp, which is a copy of the original dictionary. Then, it iterates over the items in the string dictionary and for each key-value pair (a, b), it adds a new key-value pair to the temp dictionary with the value as the key and the key as the value. Finally, it returns the temp dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {1: -9, 0: -7} and {1: 2, 0: 3}, we need to follow the steps of the function:
1. Create a new dictionary called temp as a copy of the original dictionary: {1: -9, 0: -7}.
2. Iterate over the items in the string dictionary: {1: 2, 0: 3}.
   - For the first key-value pair (1, 2), add a new key-value pair to temp with the value as the key and the key as the value: {1: -9, 0: -7, 2: 1}.
   - For the second key-value pair (0, 3), add a new key-value pair to temp with the value as the key and the key as the value: {1: -9, 0: -7, 2: 1, 3: 0}.
3. Return the temp dictionary: {1: -9, 0: -7, 2: 1, 3: 0}.

<<<Output>>>
{1: -9, 0: -7, 2: 1, 3: 0}
