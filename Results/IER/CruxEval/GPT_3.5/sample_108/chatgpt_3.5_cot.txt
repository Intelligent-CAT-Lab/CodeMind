<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a variable var as input and performs the following steps:
1. It checks if the type of var is a list. If it is, it assigns the length of var to the variable amount. Otherwise, it assigns 0 to amount.
2. It checks if the type of var is a dictionary. If it is, it assigns the length of var.keys() to the variable amount.
3. It checks if the value of amount is greater than 0. If it is, it assigns the value of amount to the variable nonzero. Otherwise, it assigns 0 to nonzero.
4. It returns the value of nonzero.

In this case, the input var is an integer, which is not a list or a dictionary. Therefore, the value of amount remains 0 and the value of nonzero is also 0.

<<<Output>>>
