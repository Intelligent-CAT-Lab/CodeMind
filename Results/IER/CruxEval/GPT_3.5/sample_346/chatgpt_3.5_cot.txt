<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a filename as input and performs the following steps:
1. It splits the filename by the '.' character and takes the last element of the resulting list, which represents the file extension.
2. It reverses the file extension using slicing with a step of -1.
3. It concatenates the filename with the reversed file extension.
4. It checks if the resulting string ends with the original file extension.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'docs.doc', we need to follow these steps:
1. Splitting 'docs.doc' by '.' gives us ['docs', 'doc'].
2. Taking the last element of the list gives us 'doc'.
3. Reversing 'doc' gives us 'cod'.
4. Concatenating 'docs.doc' with 'cod' gives us 'docs.doccod'.
5. Checking if 'docs.doccod' ends with 'doc' returns False.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'docs.doc' is False.
