<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and char. It checks if the char is present in the text. If it is, the function splits the text using the char as the delimiter and removes any leading or trailing whitespace from each split element. If there are more than one split elements, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

In this case, the text is "only one line" and the char is a space (" "). The space is present in the text, so the function splits the text into three elements: "only", "one", and "line". Since there are more than one split elements, the function returns True.

<<<Output>>>
True
