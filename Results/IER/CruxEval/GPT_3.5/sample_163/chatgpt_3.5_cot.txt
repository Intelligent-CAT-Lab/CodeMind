<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three inputs: text, space_symbol, and size. It first calculates the number of spaces needed by subtracting the length of the text from the size. Then, it creates a string of spaces by repeating the space_symbol that many times. Finally, it concatenates the text and the spaces together and returns the result.

In this case, the input values are 'w' for text, '))' for space_symbol, and 7 for size. The length of the text is 1, so the number of spaces needed is 7 - 1 = 6. The function then creates a string of 6 spaces by repeating '))' 6 times. Finally, it concatenates 'w' and the string of spaces together, resulting in 'w))))))'.

<<<Output>>>
'w))))))'
