<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input and returns a new list l that contains only the unique elements from nums. 

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8], we need to iterate over each element in the input list and check if it is already present in the new list l. If it is not present, we append it to l.

Here is the step-by-step analysis:
1. Initialize an empty list l.
2. Iterate over each element i in the input list [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8].
3. For each element i, check if it is already present in l.
4. If i is not present in l, append it to l.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 for each element in the input list.
6. Return the final list l.

<<<Output>>>
[3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 8]
