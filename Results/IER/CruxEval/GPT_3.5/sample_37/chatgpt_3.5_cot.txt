<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and initializes an empty list called text_arr. 
Then, it iterates over the indices of the characters in the input string using the range function and the len function.
For each index j, it appends the substring of text starting from index j to the end of the string to the text_arr list.
Finally, it returns the text_arr list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '123', we need to follow these steps:
1. Initialize an empty list called text_arr.
2. Iterate over the indices of the characters in the input string '123' using the range function and the len function.
   - For j = 0, append the substring '123' to the text_arr list.
   - For j = 1, append the substring '23' to the text_arr list.
   - For j = 2, append the substring '3' to the text_arr list.
3. Return the text_arr list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '123' is ['123', '23', '3'].
<<<Output>>>
['123', '23', '3']
