<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers `nums` and an index `i` as input. It removes the element at index `i` from the list `nums` using the `pop()` method and then returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `[35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]` and `0`, we need to remove the element at index `0` from the list `[35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]`.

After removing the element at index `0`, the modified list becomes `[45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `[35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]` and `0` is `[45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]`.
<<<Output>>>
[45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]
