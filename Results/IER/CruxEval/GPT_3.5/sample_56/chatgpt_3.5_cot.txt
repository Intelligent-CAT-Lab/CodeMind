<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string sentence as input and iterates over each character in the string. 
For each character, it checks if the character is an ASCII character using the isascii() method. 
If the character is not an ASCII character, the function returns False. 
If all characters in the string are ASCII characters, the function returns True. 

In the given input '1z1z1', all characters are ASCII characters. 
Therefore, the function will iterate over each character and continue to the next character. 
After iterating over all characters, the function will return True. 

<<<Output>>>
True
