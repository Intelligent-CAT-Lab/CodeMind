<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: an array and an integer n. It returns a new array that contains all elements of the input array starting from index n to the end.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2] and 4, we need to extract all elements starting from index 4 to the end of the array.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2] and 4 is [2, 2, 2, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 2, 2, 2]
