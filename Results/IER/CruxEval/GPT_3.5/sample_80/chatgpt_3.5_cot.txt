<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and performs the following steps:
1. It removes any trailing whitespace from the string using the rstrip() method.
2. It reverses the order of the characters in the string using the reversed() function.
3. It joins the reversed characters back together into a single string using the join() method, with an empty string as the separator.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ab        ', we need to follow these steps:
1. Remove the trailing whitespace from the input string, resulting in 'ab'.
2. Reverse the order of the characters in the string, resulting in 'ba'.
3. Join the reversed characters back together into a single string, resulting in 'ba'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ab        ' is 'ba'.
<<<Output>>>
'ba'
