The function f takes a dictionary d as input. 
First, it calculates the length of the dictionary and subtracts 1 from it. 
Then, it uses the index to get the last key in the dictionary by converting the dictionary keys to a list and accessing the element at the calculated index. 
Next, it removes the key-value pair from the dictionary using the pop() method. 
Finally, it returns a tuple containing the last key and the modified dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input dict(e=1, d=2, c=3), we need to follow these steps:
1. Calculate the length of the dictionary: len(dict(e=1, d=2, c=3)) = 3
2. Subtract 1 from the length: 3 - 1 = 2
3. Convert the dictionary keys to a list: ['e', 'd', 'c']
4. Access the element at index 2: 'c'
5. Remove the key-value pair from the dictionary: dict(e=1, d=2)
6. Return a tuple containing the last key and the modified dictionary: ('c', dict(e=1, d=2))

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input dict(e=1, d=2, c=3) is ('c', {'e': 1, 'd': 2}).
<<<Output>>>
('c', {'e': 1, 'd': 2})
