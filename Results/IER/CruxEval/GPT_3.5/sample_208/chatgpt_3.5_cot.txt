<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list that contains all the non-digit characters from the input strings.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['123', 'cat', 'd dee'], we need to iterate over each string in the input list and then iterate over each character in each string. If the character is not a digit, we append it to the result list.
In the first iteration, the string '123' is processed. Since all the characters in this string are digits, no characters are appended to the result list.
In the second iteration, the string 'cat' is processed. The character 'c' is not a digit, so it is appended to the result list.
In the third iteration, the string 'd dee' is processed. The characters 'd', ' ', 'd', 'e', and 'e' are not digits, so they are appended to the result list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['123', 'cat', 'd dee'] is ['c', 'd', ' ', 'd', 'e', 'e'].
<<<Output>>>
['c', 'd', ' ', 'd', 'e', 'e']
