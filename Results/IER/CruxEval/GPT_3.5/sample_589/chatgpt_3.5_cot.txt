<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list num as input. It appends the last element of the list to the end of the list and then returns the modified list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-70, 20, 9, 1], we need to append the last element (1) to the end of the list. After appending, the list becomes [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-70, 20, 9, 1] is [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]
