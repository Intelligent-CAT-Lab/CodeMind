The function f takes a dictionary d as input. 
First, it determines the size of the dictionary by using the len() function and assigns it to the variable size.
Then, it creates a list v with size number of elements, where each element is initialized to 0.
If the size of the dictionary is 0, it returns the list v.
Otherwise, it iterates over the values of the dictionary using the enumerate() function, which returns both the index i and the value e.
For each iteration, it assigns the value e to the i-th element of the list v.
Finally, it returns the list v.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, we need to go through the steps of the function:
1. The size of the dictionary is 3.
2. Create a list v with 3 elements, initialized to [0, 0, 0].
3. Iterate over the values of the dictionary: 1, 2, 3.
4. Assign each value to the corresponding index in the list v: [1, 2, 3].
5. Return the list v.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} is [1, 2, 3].
