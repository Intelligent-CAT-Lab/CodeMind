<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string st as input and initializes an empty string called swapped. 
Then, it iterates over each character in the reversed version of st. 
For each character, it swaps the case (lowercase to uppercase and vice versa) and appends it to the swapped string. 
Finally, it returns the swapped string. 

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'RTiGM', we need to reverse the string and swap the case of each character. 
The reversed string is 'MGiTR'. 
Swapping the case of each character, we get 'mgItr'. 
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'RTiGM' is 'mgItr'.
<<<Output>>>
'mgItr'
