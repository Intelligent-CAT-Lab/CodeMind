<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following steps:
1. It calculates the length of the input string and assigns it to the variable length.
2. It initializes the variable index to 0.
3. It enters a while loop that continues as long as the index is less than the length and the character at the current index in the text is a whitespace character.
4. Inside the loop, it increments the index by 1.
5. After the loop, it returns a substring of the text starting from the current index and with a length of 5.

In the given input '-----\t\n\tth\n-----', the function will start from the first character and continue until it encounters a non-whitespace character. In this case, the first non-whitespace character is 't' at index 6. Therefore, the function will return the substring starting from index 6 and with a length of 5, which is 't\n---'.

<<<Output>>>
't\n---'
