The function f takes two strings s1 and s2 as input. It initializes an empty list res and a variable i to the index of the last occurrence of s2 in s1 using the rfind() method. 

Then, it enters a while loop that continues as long as i is not equal to -1. Inside the loop, it appends the index of the last character of the last occurrence of s2 in s1 to the res list. It then updates the value of i to the index of the next occurrence of s2 in s1, starting from index 0 and ending at i-1.

Finally, it returns the res list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'abcdefghabc' and 'abc', we need to find all the occurrences of 'abc' in 'abcdefghabc' and append the index of the last character of each occurrence to the res list.

The first occurrence of 'abc' is at index 8, so we append 8 + len('abc') - 1 = 10 to the res list.
The second occurrence of 'abc' is at index 0, so we append 0 + len('abc') - 1 = 2 to the res list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'abcdefghabc' and 'abc' is [10, 2].
