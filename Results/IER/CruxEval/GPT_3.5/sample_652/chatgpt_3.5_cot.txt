<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input. 
First, it checks if the string is empty or if the first character of the string is not numeric. If either of these conditions is true, it returns 'INVALID'.
If the string is not empty and the first character is numeric, it initializes a variable cur to 0.
Then, it iterates over each character in the string. For each character, it multiplies the current value of cur by 10 and adds the integer value of the character to cur.
Finally, it returns the string representation of cur.

In this case, the input string is '3'. The string is not empty and the first character is numeric. So, the function will enter the for loop and execute the code inside it.
The variable cur is initially 0. In the first iteration, cur is multiplied by 10 and the integer value of '3' is added to it, resulting in cur being 3.
After the loop, the function returns the string representation of cur, which is '3'.

<<<Output>>>
'3'
