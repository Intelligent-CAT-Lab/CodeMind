<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: text, fill, and size. 
If the size is negative, it is converted to a positive value.
If the length of the text is greater than the size, the function returns the last size characters of the text.
Otherwise, the function right justifies the text with the fill character, until the length of the text is equal to the size.

In this case, the input text is 'no asw', the fill character is 'j', and the size is 1.
Since the size is positive, it is not changed.
The length of the text is 7, which is greater than the size.
Therefore, the function returns the last 1 character of the text, which is 'w'.

<<<Output>>>
'w'
