<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and suffix. It checks if both suffix and text are non-empty and if the text ends with the suffix. If both conditions are true, it removes the suffix from the text using the removesuffix() method and returns the modified text. Otherwise, it returns the original text.

In this case, the input text is 'spider' and the suffix is 'ed'. The text does end with the suffix 'ed', so the condition in the if statement is true. Therefore, the function will remove the suffix 'ed' from the text and return the modified text.

<<<Output>>>
'spid'
