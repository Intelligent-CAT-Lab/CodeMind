The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following steps:
1. It initializes an empty dictionary d.
2. It removes all occurrences of '-' from the input string using the replace() method and converts the resulting string to lowercase using the lower() method.
3. It iterates over each character in the modified string.
4. For each character, it checks if it already exists as a key in the dictionary d.
   - If it exists, it increments the value associated with that key by 1.
   - If it doesn't exist, it adds the character as a new key in the dictionary with a value of 1.
5. After iterating over all characters, it sorts the dictionary items based on their values in ascending order using the sorted() function and a lambda function as the key argument.
6. It returns a list of the values from the sorted dictionary items.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "x--y-z-5-C", we need to follow these steps:
1. Remove all occurrences of '-' from the input string: "x--y-z-5-C" -> "xyz5c".
2. Convert the modified string to lowercase: "xyz5c" -> "xyz5c".
3. Iterate over each character in the modified string:
   - For 'x', add it as a new key in the dictionary d with a value of 1.
   - For 'y', add it as a new key in the dictionary d with a value of 1.
   - For 'z', add it as a new key in the dictionary d with a value of 1.
   - For '5', add it as a new key in the dictionary d with a value of 1.
   - For 'c', add it as a new key in the dictionary d with a value of 1.
4. Sort the dictionary items based on their values in ascending order: [('x', 1), ('y', 1), ('z', 1), ('5', 1), ('c', 1)].
5. Return a list of the values from the sorted dictionary items: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "x--y-z-5-C" is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
