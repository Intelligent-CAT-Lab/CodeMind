<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list orig as input. It creates a new list copy and assigns it the same value as orig. Then, it appends the value 100 to the copy list. Next, it removes the last element from the orig list using the pop() method. Finally, it returns the copy list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to follow the steps:
1. Create a new list copy and assign it the same value as orig, which is [1, 2, 3].
2. Append the value 100 to the copy list, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 100].
3. Remove the last element from the orig list, resulting in [1, 2].
4. Return the copy list, which is [1, 2, 3, 100].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3, 100].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 100]
