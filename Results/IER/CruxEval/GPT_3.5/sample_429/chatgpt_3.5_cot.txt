The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns a list of tuples. 
The function first initializes an empty list called result.
Then, it enters a while loop that continues as long as the length of the keys in the dictionary is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, the function appends the result of the popitem() method to the result list.
The popitem() method removes and returns an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary as a tuple.
Finally, when the while loop condition is no longer true, the function returns the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {5: 1, 'abc': 2, 'defghi': 2, 87.29: 3}, we need to go through the steps of the function execution:
1. The dictionary has 4 key-value pairs.
2. The popitem() method removes and returns an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary. Let's say it returns (5, 1).
3. The result list is now [(5, 1)].
4. The dictionary now has 3 key-value pairs.
5. The popitem() method removes and returns an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary. Let's say it returns ('abc', 2).
6. The result list is now [(5, 1), ('abc', 2)].
7. The dictionary now has 2 key-value pairs.
8. The popitem() method removes and returns an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary. Let's say it returns ('defghi', 2).
9. The result list is now [(5, 1), ('abc', 2), ('defghi', 2)].
10. The dictionary now has 1 key-value pair.
11. The popitem() method removes and returns an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary. Let's say it returns (87.29, 3).
12. The result list is now [(5, 1), ('abc', 2), ('defghi', 2), (87.29, 3)].
13. The dictionary now has 0 key-value pairs.
14. The while loop condition is no longer true, so the function returns the result list [(5, 1), ('abc', 2), ('defghi', 2), (87.29, 3)].

<<<Output>>>
[(5, 1), ('abc', 2), ('defghi', 2), (87.29, 3)]
