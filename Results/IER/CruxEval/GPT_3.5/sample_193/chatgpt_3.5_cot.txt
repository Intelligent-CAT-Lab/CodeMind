<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and counts the number of occurrences of the character ':' in the string. It then replaces all but one occurrence of ':' with an empty string and returns the modified string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '1::1', we need to count the number of occurrences of ':' in the string. In this case, there are two occurrences of ':'. 

Next, we replace all but one occurrence of ':' with an empty string. Since there are two occurrences, we replace one of them with an empty string. 

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '1::1' is '1:1'.
<<<Output>>>
'1:1'
