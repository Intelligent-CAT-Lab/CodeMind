The function f takes a list of lists as input. 
In the first step, it clears the second list (lists[1]).
In the second step, it concatenates the second list (which is now empty) to the third list (lists[2]).
In the final step, it returns the first list (lists[0]).

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [[395, 666, 7, 4], [], [4223, 111]], we need to follow these steps:
1. Clear the second list: [[395, 666, 7, 4], [], [4223, 111]] -> [[395, 666, 7, 4], [], [4223, 111]]
2. Concatenate the second list with the third list: [[395, 666, 7, 4], [], [4223, 111]] -> [[395, 666, 7, 4], [], [4223, 111]]
3. Return the first list: [[395, 666, 7, 4], [], [4223, 111]] -> [395, 666, 7, 4]

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [[395, 666, 7, 4], [], [4223, 111]] is [395, 666, 7, 4].
