<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input. 
If the text is not in title case (i.e., the first letter of each word is capitalized and the rest are lowercase), the function returns the title case version of the text using the title() method.
If the text is already in title case, the function returns the lowercase version of the text using the lower() method.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "PermissioN is GRANTed", we need to analyze the steps:
1. The input text "PermissioN is GRANTed" is not in title case, so the function returns the title case version of the text: "Permission Is Granted".
2. The output "Permission Is Granted" is returned.

<<<Output>>>
'Permission Is Granted'
