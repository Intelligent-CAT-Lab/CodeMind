<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following steps:
1. Split the string text into a list of substrings using the split() method.
2. Apply the lstrip() method to each substring in the list using the map() function.
3. Join the modified substrings back into a single string using the join() method, with a space (' ') as the separator.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'pvtso', we need to follow these steps:
1. Split the string 'pvtso' into a list of substrings: ['pvtso'].
2. Apply the lstrip() method to each substring in the list: ['pvtso'].
3. Join the modified substrings back into a single string using a space as the separator: 'pvtso'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'pvtso' is 'pvtso'.

'pvtso'
