<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a list of numbers nums and a character fill. 
Inside the function, a dictionary ans is created using the dict.fromkeys() method. 
The keys of the dictionary are the elements of the nums list, and the values are set to the fill character. 
Finally, the dictionary ans is returned as the output of the function.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 1, 1, 2] and 'abcca', we need to create a dictionary with the keys as the elements of the list [0, 1, 1, 2] and the values as the character 'abcca'. 

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 1, 1, 2] and 'abcca' is {0: 'abcca', 1: 'abcca', 2: 'abcca'}.

<<<Output>>>
{0: 'abcca', 1: 'abcca', 2: 'abcca'}
