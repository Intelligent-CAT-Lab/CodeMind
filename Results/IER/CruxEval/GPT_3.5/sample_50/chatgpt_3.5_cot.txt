<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input. 
First, the function clears the list using the clear() method.
Next, it appends [1] * (len(lst) + 1) to the list. 
Since the length of lst is 3, [1] * (len(lst) + 1) will be [1] * 4, which is [1, 1, 1, 1].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['a', 'c', 'v'] is [1, 1, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 1]
