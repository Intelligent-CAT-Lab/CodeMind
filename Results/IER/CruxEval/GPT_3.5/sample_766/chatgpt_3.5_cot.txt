<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a list of values and a single value. 
First, it calculates the length of the list using the len() function and assigns it to the variable length.
Then, it creates a new dictionary using the dict.fromkeys() method. This method takes two arguments: the list of values and the single value. It creates a dictionary where each value in the list is a key and the single value is the corresponding value for each key.
Next, it creates a new key-value pair in the dictionary. The key is the sorted concatenation of the values in the list, obtained by using the ''.join() method on the sorted list. The value is the single value multiplied by 3.
Finally, it returns the new dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['0','3'] and 117, we need to follow these steps:
1. Calculate the length of the list ['0','3'], which is 2.
2. Create a new dictionary with keys '0' and '3', and values 117 for both keys.
3. Create a new key-value pair in the dictionary with the key '03' (sorted concatenation of the values in the list) and the value 117 * 3 = 351.
4. Return the new dictionary.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['0','3'] and 117 is {'0': 117, '3': 117, '03': 351}.
<<<Output>>>
{'0': 117, '3': 117, '03': 351}
