The function f takes a dictionary d as input. 
First, it sorts the items in the dictionary based on the keys in descending order. 
Then, it retrieves the key and value of the first item in the sorted list and assigns them to key1 and val1 respectively. 
Next, it removes the first item from the dictionary. 
Then, it sorts the remaining items in the dictionary based on the keys in descending order again. 
It retrieves the key and value of the first item in the sorted list and assigns them to key2 and val2 respectively. 
Finally, it returns a new dictionary with key1 and val1 as one item and key2 and val2 as another item.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {2: 3, 17: 3, 16: 6, 18: 6, 87: 7}, we need to follow the steps of the function:
1. Sort the items in the dictionary based on the keys in descending order: [(87, 7), (18, 6), (17, 3), (16, 6), (2, 3)]
2. Retrieve the key and value of the first item: key1 = 87, val1 = 7
3. Remove the first item from the dictionary: {2: 3, 17: 3, 16: 6, 18: 6}
4. Sort the remaining items in the dictionary based on the keys in descending order: [(18, 6), (17, 3), (16, 6), (2, 3)]
5. Retrieve the key and value of the first item: key2 = 18, val2 = 6
6. Return a new dictionary with key1 and val1 as one item and key2 and val2 as another item: {87: 7, 18: 6}

<<<Output>>>
{87: 7, 18: 6}
