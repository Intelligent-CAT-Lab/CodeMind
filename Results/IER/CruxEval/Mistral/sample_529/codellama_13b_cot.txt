The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The function first initializes two variables: prev and newArray.
prev is set to the first element of the array, and newArray is a copy of the original array.
The function then iterates over the array starting from the second element (index 1).
For each element, the function compares it with the previous element (prev).
If the two elements are not equal, the function sets the corresponding element in newArray to the current element.
If the two elements are equal, the function removes the current element from newArray.
Finally, the function sets prev to the current element and continues iterating over the array.
After the loop completes, the function returns newArray.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to compare each element with the previous element and remove any duplicates.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2]
