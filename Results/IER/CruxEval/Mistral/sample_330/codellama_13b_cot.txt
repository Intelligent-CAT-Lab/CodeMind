The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string. It initializes an empty list ans. It then iterates over each character in the input string text. If the character is a digit, it appends the character to the list ans. Otherwise, it appends a space to the list ans. Finally, it returns the string formed by joining the elements of the list ans with spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "m4n2o", we need to iterate over each character in the input string "m4n2o". The first character "m" is not a digit, so it appends a space to the list ans. The second character "4" is a digit, so it appends "4" to the list ans. The third character "n" is not a digit, so it appends a space to the list ans. The fourth character "2" is a digit, so it appends "2" to the list ans. The fifth character "o" is not a digit, so it appends a space to the list ans. Finally, the function returns the string formed by joining the elements of the list ans with spaces, which is " 4 2 o ".
