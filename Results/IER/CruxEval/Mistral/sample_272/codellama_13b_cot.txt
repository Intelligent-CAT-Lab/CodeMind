The function f takes two lists as input: base\_list and nums. It first extends the base\_list with the elements of nums using the extend() method. Then it creates a copy of the base\_list using the copy() method.
Next, it loops through the elements of nums in reverse order and appends each element to the end of the copy of the base\_list.
Finally, it returns the copy of the base\_list with the elements of nums appended in reverse order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1]` and `[2, 4, 6, 8, 0]`, we first extend the base\_list `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1]` with the elements of nums `[2, 4, 6, 8, 0]` using the extend() method.
Then it creates a copy of the base\_list `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1]` using the copy() method.
Next, it loops through the elements of nums `[2, 4, 6, 8, 0]` in reverse order and appends each element to the end of the copy of the base\_list.
Finally, it returns the copy of the base\_list `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1]` with the elements of nums `[2, 4, 6, 8, 0]` appended in reverse order.
<<<Output>>>
[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 0, 8, 6, 4, 2]
