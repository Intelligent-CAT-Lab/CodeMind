<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary dic as input and returns a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary, sorted in ascending order based on the key.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'b': 1, 'a': 2}, we need to sort the dictionary's key-value pairs in ascending order based on the key.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'b': 1, 'a': 2} is [('a', 2), ('b', 1)].
<<<Output>>>
[('a', 2), ('b', 1)]
