<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string sample as input and returns the last occurrence of the substring "/" in the string sample.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "present/here/car%2Fwe", we need to find the last occurrence of the substring "/" in the string.
The last occurrence of the substring "/" in the string is "car%2Fwe".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "present/here/car%2Fwe" is "car%2Fwe".
<<<Output>>>
'car%2Fwe'
