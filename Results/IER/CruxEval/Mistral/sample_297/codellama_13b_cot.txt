<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer num as input and returns the string "Half Life" if the number is between 0 and 1000 and not equal to 6174. Otherwise, it returns the string "Not found".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 6173, we need to check if 6173 is between 0 and 1000 and not equal to 6174.
Since 6173 is not between 0 and 1000 and not equal to 6174, the function f returns the string "Not found".
<<<Output>>>
'Not found'
