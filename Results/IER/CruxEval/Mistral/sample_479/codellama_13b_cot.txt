<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a list of integers nums, and two integers pop1 and pop2.
The function removes the elements at indices pop1 - 1 and pop2 - 1 from the list nums and returns the resulting list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 2, 3, 6], pop1 = 2, and pop2 = 4, we need to remove the elements at indices 1 and 3 from the list [1, 5, 2, 3, 6].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 2, 3, 6], pop1 = 2, and pop2 = 4 is [1, 5, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 6]
