<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The function first creates a new array called result by using the copy() method of the input array.
Then, the reverse() method is called on the result array to reverse its elements.
Finally, a list comprehension is used to double each element of the result array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
