<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list arr as input and returns a new list that is the reverse of the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list [2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5], we need to reverse the order of the elements in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list [2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5] is [9999, 3, -5, 1, 0, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[9999, 3, -5, 1, 0, 2]
