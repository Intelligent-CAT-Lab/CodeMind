<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function first calculates the middle index of the list by dividing the length of the list by 2 and rounding down to the nearest integer.
Then, the function returns the list of integers from the middle index to the end of the list, followed by the list of integers from the beginning of the list to the middle index.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1], we need to calculate the middle index as 1 (since the length of the list is 3 and 3 divided by 2 is 1.5, which rounds down to 1).
Then, the function returns the list [1, 1] (from the middle index to the end of the list) followed by the list [1] (from the beginning of the list to the middle index).
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1] is [1, 1, 1].

[1, 1, 1]
