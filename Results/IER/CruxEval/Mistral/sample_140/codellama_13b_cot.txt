<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string st as input and returns either 'Hey' or 'Hi' based on the presence of the letters 'h' and 'i' in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Hi there", we need to check if the letters 'h' and 'i' appear in the string.
The string 'Hi there' contains the letters 'h' and 'i', but the letter 'h' appears before the letter 'i'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "Hi there" is 'Hi'.
<<<Output>>>
'Hi'
