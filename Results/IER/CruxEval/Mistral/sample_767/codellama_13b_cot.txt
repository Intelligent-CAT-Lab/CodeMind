<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string.
First, it strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string using the strip() method.
Then, it splits the string into a list of words using the split() method with the argument ' '.
Next, it loops through each word in the list using a for loop.
For each word, it checks if it is a digit using the isdigit() method.
If a word is not a digit, it returns '-'.
If all words are digits, it joins the list of words back into a string using the join() method with the argument ' '.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41" is "-".
<<<Output>>>
'-'
