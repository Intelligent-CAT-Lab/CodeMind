<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary as input and returns a list of keys in the dictionary that are even numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input { 4: 'a' }, we need to check if the key 4 is even.
Since 4 is an even number, it is added to the list of even keys.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input { 4: 'a' } is [4].
<<<Output>>>
[4]
