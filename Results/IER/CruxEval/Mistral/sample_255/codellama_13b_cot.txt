<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: text, fill, and size.
The function first checks if the size is negative, if so, it negates the size.
Then, it checks if the length of the text is greater than the size, if so, it returns the text from the end of the text to the end of the size.
If the length of the text is less than or equal to the size, it returns the text right-justified with the fill character to the size.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'no asw', 'j', and 1, we first check if the size is negative, which it is not.
Then, we check if the length of the text is greater than the size, which it is not.
Therefore, the function returns the text 'no asw' right-justified with the character 'j' to the size of 1.
<<<Output>>>
'no asw'
