<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list xs as input and returns a new list. It iterates over the list xs in reverse order, and for each element, it appends a copy of that element to the end of the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 8, 5], we need to iterate over the list in reverse order and append a copy of each element to the end of the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 8, 5] is [5, 8, 8, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 8, 8, 4]
