<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string.
The function first initializes a new string variable new\_text to be equal to the input text.
Then, it enters a while loop that continues until the length of the input text is greater than 1 and the first and last characters of the input text are equal.
Inside the loop, the function assigns the value of the input text minus the first character to the new\_text variable and assigns the value of the input text minus the last character to the text variable.
After the loop, the function returns the value of the new\_text variable.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ")", we need to check if the first and last characters of the input string are equal.
Since the first and last characters of ")" are not equal, the loop does not execute and the function returns the input string ")" without any modifications.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input ")" is ")".

')'
