The function f takes a list lst as input and performs the following operations on it:
1. The list is reversed using the reverse() method.
2. The last element of the list is removed using the pop() method.
3. The list is reversed again using the reverse() method.
4. The reversed list is returned.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 8, 2, 8], we first reverse the list to [8, 2, 8, 7]. Then we remove the last element of the list, which is 7, leaving us with [8, 2, 8]. Finally, we reverse the list again to [8, 2, 8].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 8, 2, 8] is [8, 2, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[8, 2, 8]
