<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two lists as input, a and b. It first creates a dictionary d by zipping the two lists together. Then it sorts the list a in descending order based on the values in the dictionary d. Finally, it returns a list of the values in the dictionary d, in the order of the sorted list a.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input lists ['12','ab'] and [2,2], we first create the dictionary d by zipping the two lists together:
{
'12': 2,
'ab': 2
}
Then we sort the list ['12','ab'] in descending order based on the values in the dictionary d:
['ab', '12']
Finally, we return a list of the values in the dictionary d, in the order of the sorted list ['ab', '12']:
['ab', '12']
<<<Output>>>
['ab', '12']
