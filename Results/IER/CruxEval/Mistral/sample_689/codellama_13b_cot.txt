<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list arr as input and returns a new list.
First, it calculates the length of the list using the len() function and stores it in a variable called count.
Then, it creates a new list called sub by copying the original list arr using the copy() method.
Next, it loops through the elements of the list sub starting from index 0 and increments each element by a factor of 5.
Finally, it returns the modified list sub.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list [-3, -6, 2, 7], we need to apply the above logic to the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list [-3, -6, 2, 7] is [15, 30, 10, 14].
<<<Output>>>
[15, 30, 10, 14]
