The function f takes a dictionary d as input. It modifies the dictionary by adding a key 'luck' with a value of 42 and then clearing all the keys in the dictionary using the clear() method. Finally, it returns a new dictionary with keys 1 and 2 and values False and 0 respectively.
To determine the output of executing the function f on an empty dictionary {}, we need to first modify the dictionary by adding a key 'luck' with a value of 42 and then clearing all the keys in the dictionary using the clear() method. Finally, it returns a new dictionary with keys 1 and 2 and values False and 0 respectively.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {} is {1: False, 2: 0}.
<<<Output>>>
{1: False, 2: 0}
