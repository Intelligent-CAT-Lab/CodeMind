The function f takes a string s as input and returns True if the length of s is equal to the sum of the number of occurrences of the characters '0' and '1' in s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '102', we need to check if the length of '102' is equal to the sum of the number of occurrences of the characters '0' and '1' in '102'.
The length of '102' is 3, and the number of occurrences of the character '0' in '102' is 0, and the number of occurrences of the character '1' in '102' is 2.
Therefore, the sum of the number of occurrences of the characters '0' and '1' in '102' is 0 + 2 = 2.
Since the length of '102' is 3, which is not equal to 2, the function f returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
