The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string. It initializes an empty string result. It then iterates through each character in the input string text using a for loop. For each character, it checks if the index is even or odd using the modulo operator (%). If the index is even, it appends the character in uppercase using the swapcase() method. If the index is odd, it appends the character in lowercase. Finally, it returns the result string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "vsnlygltaw", we need to iterate through each character in the string and apply the logic described above.
The output of executing the function f on the input "vsnlygltaw" is "Vsnlygltaw".
<<<Output>>>
'Vsnlygltaw'
