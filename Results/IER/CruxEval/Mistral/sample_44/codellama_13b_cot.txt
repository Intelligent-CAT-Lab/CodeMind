<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string with all the characters in the input string except for '+' replaced with '+*'.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "nzoh", we need to replace all the characters in the string except for '+' with '+*'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "nzoh" is "+*zoh".
<<<Output>>>
'+*zoh'
