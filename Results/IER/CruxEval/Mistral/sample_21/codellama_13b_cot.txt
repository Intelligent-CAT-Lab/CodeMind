<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list array as input and returns a new list.
The function first removes the last element of the list using the pop() method and stores it in the variable n.
Then, the function extends the list by adding two copies of the value of n using the extend() method.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 2, 2] is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]
