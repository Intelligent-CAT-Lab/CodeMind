<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the reversed string s with all leading and trailing whitespace removed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "ab        ", we need to first remove the leading and trailing whitespace using the rstrip() method. This will result in the string "ab".
Then we reverse the string using the reversed() function and join the reversed string using the join() method.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "ab        " is "ba".
<<<Output>>>
'ba'
