The function f takes an integer n as input and returns a list of values from a dictionary values.
The dictionary values has keys 0, 1, and 2 with corresponding values 3, 4.5, and '-'.
The function iterates over the items in the values dictionary and checks if the key is not divisible by n - 2.
If the key is not divisible by n - 2, the function calculates the value of the key divided by n // 2 and stores it in a new dictionary res.
Finally, the function returns the sorted list of values from the res dictionary.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 12, we need to check if the keys 0, 1, and 2 are not divisible by 10 (12 - 2).
Since 0, 1, and 2 are not divisible by 10, the function calculates the values of the keys 0, 1, and 2 divided by 6 (12 // 2) and stores them in the res dictionary.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 12 is [3.0, 4.5, -6.0].

[3.0, 4.5, -6.0]
