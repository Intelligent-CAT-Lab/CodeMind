The function f takes a string of comma-separated names as input. It first splits the string into a list of individual names using the split() method with the comma as the delimiter.
Then, it iterates over each name in the list using a for loop. For each name, it replaces the string " and " with " + " using the replace() method, and then converts the first letter of the name to uppercase using the title() method.
Finally, it replaces the string " + " with " and " using the replace() method.
After processing all the names, it joins them back together into a single string using the join() method with a comma as the delimiter.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "carrot, banana, and strawberry", we first split the input string into a list of individual names. Then, we iterate over each name, replacing " and " with " + " and converting the first letter to uppercase. After processing all the names, we join them back together into a single string with a comma as the delimiter.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "carrot, banana, and strawberry" is "Carrot, Banana+Strawberry".
<<<Output>>>
'Carrot, Banana+Strawberry'
