<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: s, from_c, and to_c.
s is a string that needs to be translated.
from_c is a string that represents the characters to be replaced in s.
to_c is a string that represents the characters to replace the characters from_c in s.
The function creates a translation table using the maketrans() method, which replaces each character in from_c with the corresponding character in to_c.
Then, the function uses the translate() method to apply the translation table to the string s.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'aphid', 'i', '?' is the string 'aphid' with all occurrences of 'i' replaced with '?'.
<<<Output>>>
'aphid'
