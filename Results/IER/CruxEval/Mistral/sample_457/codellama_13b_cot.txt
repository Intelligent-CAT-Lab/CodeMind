<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function first creates a list count with the same length as nums. It then iterates through nums and removes each element from both lists.
If the length of count is greater than 0, it removes the first element from count.
Finally, the function returns the remaining elements in nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 7, 5, 6], we need to remove each element from both lists and keep track of the length of count.
The output of the function f on the input [3, 1, 7, 5, 6] is [5, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 6]
