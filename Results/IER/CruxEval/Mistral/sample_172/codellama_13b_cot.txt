<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list array as input and removes all elements from the list that are less than 0.
To determine the output of executing the function f on an empty list [], we need to check if any element in the list is less than 0.
Since an empty list does not contain any elements, the function will not remove any elements and will return an empty list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [] is [].
<<<Output>>>
[]
