<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and value. The function uses the ljust method of the string class to left-justify the text string with the number of characters equal to the length of the value string. If the length of the text string is less than the length of the value string, the text string is padded with the character "?".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "!?", we need to left-justify the string "!?" with the number of characters equal to the length of the empty string "".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "!?" is "!?".
<<<Output>>>
"!?"
