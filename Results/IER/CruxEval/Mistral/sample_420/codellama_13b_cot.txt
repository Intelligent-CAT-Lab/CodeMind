<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns True if all characters in the string are alphabets, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "x", we need to check if all characters in "x" are alphabets.
Since "x" contains only one character which is not an alphabet, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
