<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list as input and sorts it in ascending order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [63, 0, 1, 5, 9, 87, 0, 7, 25, 4], we need to sort the list in ascending order.
The sorted list would be [0, 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 25, 4, 63, 9].
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input [63, 0, 1, 5, 9, 87, 0, 7, 25, 4] is [0, 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 25, 4, 63, 9].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 25, 4, 63, 9]
