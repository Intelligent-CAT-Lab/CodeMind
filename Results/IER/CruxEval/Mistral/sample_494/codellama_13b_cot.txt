<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string num and an integer l. It initializes an empty string t.
It then enters a while loop that continues until l is less than or equal to the length of num.
Inside the loop, it concatenates a "0" to the end of t and decrements l by 1.
Finally, it returns the concatenation of t and num.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "1" and 3, we need to concatenate "1" with "00" (since 3 - 1 = 2 and 2 - 1 = 1, and 1 - 1 = 0, so we need to add two "0"s to the end of "1").
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "1" and 3 is "001".
<<<Output>>>
'001'
