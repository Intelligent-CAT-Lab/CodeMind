<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns either 'yes' or 'no' depending on whether the string contains any non-numeric characters.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '03625163633 d', we need to split the string into individual characters and check if any of them are not numeric.
The split() method splits the string into a list of individual characters.
The for loop iterates over each character in the list and checks if it is not numeric using the isnumeric() method.
If any character is not numeric, the function returns 'no'.
Since the input string contains only numeric characters, the function returns 'yes'.
<<<Output>>>
'yes'
