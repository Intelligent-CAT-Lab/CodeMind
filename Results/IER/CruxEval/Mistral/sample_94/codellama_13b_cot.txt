<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary that contains all the keys and values from both input dictionaries.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input dictionaries {{'w': 5, 'wi': 10}, {'w': 3}}, we need to create a new dictionary that contains all the keys and values from both input dictionaries.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input dictionaries {{'w': 5, 'wi': 10}, {'w': 3}} is {{'w': 8, 'wi': 10}}.
<<<Output>>>
{'w': 8, 'wi': 10}
