<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The new array is created by copying the original array using the `copy()` method.
Then, the new array is reversed using the `reversed()` function.
Finally, a new list is created by applying a lambda function to each element of the reversed array. The lambda function multiplies each element by itself.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `[1, 2, 1]` is `[1, 4, 1]`.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 1]
