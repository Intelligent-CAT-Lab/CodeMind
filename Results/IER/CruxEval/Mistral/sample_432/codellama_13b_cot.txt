<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: length and text. It checks if the length of the text is equal to the given length. If it is, it returns the reversed version of the text using slicing. If it is not, it returns False.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (-5, 'G5ogb6f,c7e.EMm'), we need to check if the length of the text is equal to -5. Since it is not, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
