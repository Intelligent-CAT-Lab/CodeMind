<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: text, position, and value.
The function first calculates the length of the text using the len() function.
It then calculates the index of the position using the modulo operator (%).
If the position is negative, the index is calculated as the length of the text divided by 2.
The function then creates a new list from the text using the list() function.
It inserts the value at the calculated index using the insert() method.
It then removes the last element of the list using the pop() method.
Finally, the function joins the elements of the new list using the join() method and returns the result.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'sduyai', 1, and 'y', we need to insert 'y' at the index 1 of the string 'sduyai'.
The index 1 corresponds to the second character of the string, which is 'd'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'sduyai', 1, and 'y' is 'sduyai'.
<<<Output>>>
'sduyai'
