<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary dic as input and returns a new dictionary dic2.
The new dictionary dic2 is created by using the zip function to iterate over the values and keys of the input dictionary dic.
The zip function returns an iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains a value from dic and its corresponding key.
The dict function is then used to convert the iterator of tuples into a dictionary.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input dictionary {-1: "a", 0: "b", 1: "c"} is {1: "a", 0: "b", -1: "c"}.
<<<Output>>>
{1: "a", 0: "b", -1: "c"}
