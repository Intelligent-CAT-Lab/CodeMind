<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the sum of the digits in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "so456", we need to iterate over each character in the string and check if it is a digit.
If the character is a digit, we add 1 to the sum.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "so456" is 15 (4 + 5 + 6).
<<<Output>>>
15
