The function f takes an integer num as input and returns the sum of the first num elements of the sequence generated by the recursive formula:
total[i] = 1 + (total[i-1] + total[i-2])
where total[0] = 1 and total[1] = 1.
The function initializes the list total with [1] and then iterates num times, updating the list total using the recursive formula.
After iterating num times, the function returns the sum of the first num elements of the list total.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 3, we need to generate the first 3 elements of the sequence using the recursive formula.
The first element of the sequence is 1.
The second element of the sequence is 1 + (1 + 1) = 3.
The third element of the sequence is 3 + (3 + 1) = 7.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 3 is 1 + 3 + 7 = 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
