<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function iterates through the list nums from the end to the beginning, and for each element in the list, it checks if the element is odd.
If the element is odd, the function inserts a copy of the element at the index i+1.
The resulting list is returned by the function.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 3, 4, 6, -2], we need to iterate through the list and check each element.
Since 2 is even, we do not insert anything.
Since 3 is odd, we insert a copy of 3 at index 2.
Since 4 is even, we do not insert anything.
Since 6 is even, we do not insert anything.
Since -2 is odd, we insert a copy of -2 at index 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 3, 4, 6, -2] is [3, -2, 4, 6, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[3, -2, 4, 6, 2]
