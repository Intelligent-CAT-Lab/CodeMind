<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a list of tuples.
For each integer n in nums, the function appends a tuple to the output list, where the first element of the tuple is the number of occurrences of n in nums, and the second element of the tuple is the integer n itself.
The output list is then sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1] is a list of tuples: [(3, 3), (2, 1), (1, 2)].
<<<Output>>>
[(3, 3), (2, 1), (1, 2)]
