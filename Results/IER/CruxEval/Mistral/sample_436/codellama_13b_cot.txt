The function f takes two inputs: a string s and a list of integers characters. It returns a list of substrings of s, where each substring is at the index specified by an integer in the characters list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 's7 6s 1ss' and the characters list [1, 3, 6, 1, 2], we need to extract the substrings of s at the indices specified by the characters list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 's7 6s 1ss' and the characters list [1, 3, 6, 1, 2] is ['s', '7', '6', 's', '1', 's', 's'].
<<<Output>>>
['s', '7', '6', 's', '1', 's', 's']
