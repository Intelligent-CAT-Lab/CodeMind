<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements of nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8], we need to create an empty list l and then iterate over each element in nums.
For each element in nums, we check if it is already in the list l. If it is not, we append it to the list l.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8] is [3, 1, 9, 2, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[3, 1, 9, 2, 8]
