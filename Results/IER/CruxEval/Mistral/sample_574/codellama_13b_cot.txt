<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings simpons as input and returns the first string in the list that is equal to its title.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list ['George', 'Michael', 'George', 'Costanza'], we need to check if any of the strings in the list are equal to their title.
The first string in the list is 'George', which is not equal to its title.
The second string in the list is 'Michael', which is not equal to its title.
The third string in the list is 'George', which is not equal to its title.
The fourth string in the list is 'Costanza', which is not equal to its title.
Since none of the strings in the list are equal to their title, the function returns the last string in the list, which is 'Costanza'.
<<<Output>>>
'Costanza'
