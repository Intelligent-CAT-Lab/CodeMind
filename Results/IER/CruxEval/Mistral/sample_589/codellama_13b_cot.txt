<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list num as input and returns a new list.
The function first appends the last element of the list num to the list num.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list [-70, 20, 9, 1] is a new list with the same elements as the input list, but with the last element (1) appended to the end.
The new list is [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]
