<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: s and c.
The function first splits the string s by spaces using the split() method and stores the resulting list of words in the variable s.
Then, the function concatenates c with a space and a space, and concatenates that with the reverse of the list of words in s using the join() method.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'Hello There' and '*' is '* There Hello'.
<<<Output>>>
'* There Hello'
