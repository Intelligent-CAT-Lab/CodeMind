The function f takes two arguments: text and prefix. It returns the substring of text starting from the index of the first occurrence of prefix and ending at the end of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '123x John z' and prefix 'z', we need to find the index of the first occurrence of 'z' in the input string and return the substring starting from that index.
The first occurrence of 'z' in the input string is at index 6. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '123x John z' and prefix 'z' is 'John'.
<<<Output>>>
'John'
