<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and returns a new string with all the repeated characters removed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "[ Hello ]+ Hello, World!!_ Hi", we need to first convert the string to lowercase using the `lower()` method.
Then, we iterate over each character in the lowercase string and check if it is present in the temporary string `tmp`.
If the character is present in `tmp`, we remove it from `tmp` using the `replace()` method.
Finally, we return the resulting string `tmp`.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "[ Hello ]+ Hello, World!!_ Hi" is "hello world hi".
<<<Output>>>
'hello world hi'
