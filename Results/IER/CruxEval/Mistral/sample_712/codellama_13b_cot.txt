<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a list of the reversed words in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "A(hiccup)A", we need to split the string into lines, reverse the words in each line, and then reverse the order of the lines.
The reversed words in the string "A(hiccup)A" are "A(hiccup)A".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "A(hiccup)A" is "A(hiccup)A".
<<<Output>>>
['A(hiccup)A']
