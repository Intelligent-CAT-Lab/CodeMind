<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and suffix.
The function checks if the suffix is present in the text and if the text is not empty.
If both conditions are true, the function removes the suffix from the text using the removesuffix() method.
If either of the conditions is false, the function returns the original text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'spider' and 'ed', we need to check if the suffix 'ed' is present in the text 'spider' and if the text is not empty.
Since the suffix 'ed' is present in the text 'spider' and the text is not empty, the function removes the suffix 'ed' from the text 'spider' using the removesuffix() method.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'spider' and 'ed' is 'spider'.
<<<Output>>>
'spider'
