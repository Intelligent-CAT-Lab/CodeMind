<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and char. It first checks if the char is present in the text. If it is present, it splits the text using the char and then strips any leading or trailing whitespace from each resulting string. It then checks if there are more than one string in the resulting list. If there are more than one string, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'only one line' and ' ', we need to check if the char ' ' is present in the input text 'only one line'. Since it is not present, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
