<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and performs the following operations:

1. The array is reversed using the reverse() method.
2. The array is cleared using the clear() method.
3. The array is extended by appending "x" to each element of the array using the extend() method.
4. The array is reversed again using the reverse() method.
5. The function returns the reversed array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, -2, 0], we first reverse the array to [0, -2, 3]. Then we clear the array, which leaves it empty. Next, we extend the array by appending "x" to each element, resulting in [0, -2, 3, x, x, x]. Finally, we reverse the array again to [x, x, x, -2, 3, 0].

Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input [3, -2, 0] is [x, x, x, -2, 3, 0].
<<<Output>>>
[x, x, x, -2, 3, 0]
