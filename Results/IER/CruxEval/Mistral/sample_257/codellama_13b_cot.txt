<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of lists.
For each string in the input list, the function splits the string into lines using the splitlines() method and appends the resulting list to a new list called ls.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list ['Hello World\n"I am String"'] is a list of lists, where each inner list contains the lines of the input string.
<<<Output>>>
[['Hello World', 'I am String']]
