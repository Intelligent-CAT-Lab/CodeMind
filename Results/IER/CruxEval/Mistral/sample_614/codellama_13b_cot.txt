<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: text, substr, and occ.
The function uses a while loop to search for the substring substr in the text.
The loop continues until the substring is found or the number of occurrences of the substring is equal to occ.
If the substring is found, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring.
If the substring is not found and the number of occurrences of the substring is equal to occ, the function returns -1.
If the substring is not found and the number of occurrences of the substring is less than occ, the function continues the loop by removing the first occurrence of the substring from the text and incrementing the count of occurrences.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input 'zjegiymjc', 'j', 2 is the index of the second occurrence of the substring 'j' in the text 'zjegiymjc'.
<<<Output>>>
-1
