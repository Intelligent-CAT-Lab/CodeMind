<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and returns a new list.
The function initializes an empty list new.
It then iterates through the list lst from the last element to the first element.
For each element in the list, it checks if the index is even or odd.
If the index is even, it appends the negative of the element to the new list.
If the index is odd, it appends the element to the new list.
Finally, the function returns the new list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 7, -1, -3], we need to iterate through the list and apply the logic described above.
The output of the function f on the input [1, 7, -1, -3] is [7, -1, -3, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[7, -1, -3, 1]
