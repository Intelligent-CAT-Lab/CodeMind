<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string name as input and returns a new string with the first two dots removed from the end of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ".NET", we need to remove the last two dots from the string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ".NET" is "NET".
<<<Output>>>
'NET'
