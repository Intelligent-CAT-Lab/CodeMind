<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and suffix.
The function first concatenates the suffix to the text.
Then, it enters a while loop that continues until the last n characters of the text are equal to the suffix.
Inside the loop, the function removes the last n characters of the text.
Finally, the function returns the modified text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'faqo osax f' and the suffix 'f', we first concatenate 'f' to 'faqo osax f' to get 'faqof'.
Then, we enter the while loop. The last 3 characters of 'faqof' are 'of', which is equal to the suffix 'f'.
Therefore, the while loop will not execute, and the function will return 'faqof' as the output.
<<<Output>>>
'faqof'
