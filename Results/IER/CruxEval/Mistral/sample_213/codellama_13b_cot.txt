<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the string s with all occurrences of the characters '(' and ')' replaced with '[' and ']', respectively.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "ac", we need to replace all occurrences of '(' and ')' with '[' and ']', respectively.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "ac" is "[ac]".
<<<Output>>>
"[ac]"
