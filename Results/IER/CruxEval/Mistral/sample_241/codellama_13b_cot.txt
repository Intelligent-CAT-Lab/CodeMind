<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string postcode as input and returns a substring of the postcode starting from the index of the first occurrence of the letter 'C' and ending at the end of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "ED20 CW", we need to find the index of the first occurrence of the letter 'C' in the string "ED20 CW". The index of 'C' is 3.
Therefore, the substring of the postcode starting from index 3 and ending at the end of the string is "20 CW".
<<<Output>>>
'20 CW'
