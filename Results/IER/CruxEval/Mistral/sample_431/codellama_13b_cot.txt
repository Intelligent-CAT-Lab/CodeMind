<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, n and m. It creates a list of integers from 1 to n using the range function and converts it to a list using the list() function.
Then, it uses a for loop to clear the list arr m times.
Since m is 3, the for loop will run 3 times, clearing the list arr each time.
After the loop completes, the function returns the list arr, which is now empty.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input (1, 3) is an empty list.
