<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a list of the characters in the string, sorted in descending order of their frequency.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "x--y-z-5-C", we need to first remove all the hyphens from the string and convert it to lowercase.
Then, we iterate over each character in the resulting string and count its frequency using a dictionary.
The dictionary d is sorted in descending order of the frequency of each character.
Finally, we return a list of the values in the sorted dictionary.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "x--y-z-5-C" is [('x', 1), ('y', 1), ('z', 1), ('5', 1), ('C', 1)].
<<<Output>>>
[('x', 1), ('y', 1), ('z', 1), ('5', 1), ('C', 1)]
