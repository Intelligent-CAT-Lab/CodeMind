<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string of numbers as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the number "3" in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "23157", we need to count the number of occurrences of "3" in the string "23157".
Since the number "3" occurs only once in the string "23157", the function f will return -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
