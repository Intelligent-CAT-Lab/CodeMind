The function f takes two inputs: a list of strings called strings and a string called substr. It creates a new list by filtering the strings list to only include strings that start with the substr string. Then it sorts the new list in descending order based on the length of the strings.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['condor', 'eyes', 'gay', 'isa'] and substr 'd', we need to filter the strings list to only include strings that start with 'd', and then sort the new list in descending order based on the length of the strings.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['condor', 'eyes', 'gay', 'isa'] and substr 'd' is ['condor', 'eyes', 'gay', 'isa'].
<<<Output>>>
['condor', 'eyes', 'gay', 'isa']
