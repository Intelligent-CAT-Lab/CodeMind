The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns a tuple containing the key with the highest value and the updated dictionary without the key with the highest value.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input dictionary {e: 1, d: 2, c: 3}, we first need to find the key with the highest value.
The key with the highest value is "d" with a value of 2.
Next, we remove the key "d" from the dictionary using the pop() method.
The updated dictionary is {e: 1, c: 3}.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input dictionary {e: 1, d: 2, c: 3} is (2, {e: 1, c: 3}).
<<<Output>>>
(2, {e: 1, c: 3})
