<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string short. The function iterates through each character in the input string text. If the character is lowercase, it is added to the string short.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "980jio80jic kld094398IIl ", we need to iterate through each character in the input string and check if it is lowercase. If it is lowercase, we add it to the string short.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "980jio80jic kld094398IIl " is "jio80jic".
<<<Output>>>
'jio80jic'
