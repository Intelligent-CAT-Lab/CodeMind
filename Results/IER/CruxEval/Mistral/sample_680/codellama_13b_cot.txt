<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string of only the letters in the input string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "we@32r71g72ug94=(823658*!@324)", we need to iterate through each character in the input string and check if it is a letter.
We can use the isalnum() method to check if a character is a letter or a digit.
If a character is a letter or a digit, we add it to the string letters.
After iterating through all the characters in the input string, we return the string letters.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "we@32r71g72ug94=(823658*!@324)" is "weug94".
<<<Output>>>
'weug94'
