<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of numbers.
The new list is created by iterating over the input list using a for loop.
Inside the loop, the last element of the input list is removed and appended to the new list.
The loop iterates backwards, so the last element is removed first and the second last element is removed second, and so on.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list [11, 3] is [3, 11].
<<<Output>>>
[3, 11]
