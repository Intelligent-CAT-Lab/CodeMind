<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string in the format of "length:index".
The function first uses the rpartition method to find the index of the first occurrence of the string "0" in the input text.
If the index of the first occurrence of "0" is at the end of the string, the function returns "-1:-1".
Otherwise, the function returns a string in the format of "length:index", where "length" is the length of the substring before the first occurrence of "0" and "index" is the index of the first occurrence of "0" plus 1.
To determine the return value of executing the function f on the input "qq0tt", we need to find the index of the first occurrence of "0" in the input string.
The index of the first occurrence of "0" in the input string "qq0tt" is 2.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input "qq0tt" is "2:3".
<<<Output>>>
'2:3'
