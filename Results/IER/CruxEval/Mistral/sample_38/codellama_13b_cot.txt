<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and returns the string with all spaces removed and the first letter of each word capitalized.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "1oE-err bzz-bmm", we need to remove all spaces and capitalize the first letter of each word.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "1oE-err bzz-bmm" is "1oEerrbzzbmm".
<<<Output>>>
'1oEerrbzzbmm'
