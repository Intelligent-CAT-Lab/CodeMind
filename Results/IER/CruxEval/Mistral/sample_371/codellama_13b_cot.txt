<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input. It first iterates through the list using a for loop and removes any odd numbers from the list using the remove() method.
After removing the odd numbers, the function initializes a variable sum_ to 0 and iterates through the remaining list using another for loop. It adds each number in the list to the sum_ variable.
Finally, the function returns the sum_ variable.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [11, 21, 0, 11], we first remove the odd numbers 11 and 21 from the list using the remove() method.
After removing the odd numbers, the remaining list is [0, 11].
The function then iterates through the remaining list and adds each number to the sum_ variable.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [11, 21, 0, 11] is 11.

11
