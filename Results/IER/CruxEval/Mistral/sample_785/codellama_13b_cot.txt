<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer n as input and returns a string.
The function initializes an empty string streak.
It then loops through each character in the string representation of n.
For each character, it multiplies the character by 2 and pads it with spaces to make it a string of length 2 * the character value.
It then concatenates the padded string to the streak string.
Finally, the function returns the streak string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1, we need to loop through the string representation of 1, which is "1".
We multiply 1 by 2 and get 2.
We then pad 2 with spaces to make it a string of length 2 * 2, which is " 2".
We concatenate " 2" to the streak string, which is initially an empty string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 is " 2".
<<<Output>>>
' 2'
