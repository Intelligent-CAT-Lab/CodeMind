The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string. It does this by iterating over each character in the input string and only keeping characters that are not '(' (i.e. ')' is excluded). The characters that are kept are then joined together using the join() method to form a new string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '(((((((((((d))))))))).))))((((('), we need to iterate over each character in the input string and only keep characters that are not '('. The characters that are kept are then joined together using the join() method to form a new string.
The output of executing the function f on the input '(((((((((((d))))))))).))))(((((' is 'd'.
<<<Output>>>
