<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string book as input and returns the concatenation of the last word of the first sentence with the first word of the second sentence.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun", we need to split the input string into sentences using the colon as a delimiter.
The first sentence is "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd" and the second sentence is "erwuyawa pun".
We then split each sentence into words using the space as a delimiter.
The last word of the first sentence is "nhtnfyd" and the first word of the second sentence is "erwuyawa".
Since "nhtnfyd" is not equal to "erwuyawa", the if condition is not met and the function returns the original input string "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun".
<<<Output>>>
"udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun"
