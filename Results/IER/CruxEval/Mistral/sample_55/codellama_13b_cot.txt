The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The function first initializes an empty array array_2.
Then, it loops through each element in the input array array and checks if the element is greater than 0.
If the element is greater than 0, it is added to array_2.
After the loop, array_2 is sorted in descending order using the sort() method.
Finally, the sorted array_2 is returned.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14], we first check if each element is greater than 0.
Since 4, 8, 17, 43, and 14 are all greater than 0, they are added to array_2.
After the loop, array_2 is sorted in descending order, resulting in [89, 17, 43, 14, 8, 4].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input array [4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14] is [89, 17, 43, 14, 8, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[89, 17, 43, 14, 8, 4]
