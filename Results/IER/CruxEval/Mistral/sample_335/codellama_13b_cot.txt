The function f takes two arguments: text and to_remove. It first converts the text to a list, then checks if the to_remove string is present in the list. If it is, it finds the index of the string in the list using the index() method, removes the string from the list using the remove() method, inserts a question mark at the index of the removed string using the insert() method, and then removes the question mark from the list using the remove() method. Finally, it joins the list back into a string using the join() method and returns the new string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'sjbrlfqmw' and 'l', we first convert the text to a list: ['s', 'j', 'b', 'r', 'l', 'f', 'q', 'm', 'w']. We then check if the string 'l' is present in the list. Since it is, we find the index of the string using the index() method, which returns 5. We then remove the string from the list using the remove() method, which removes the string 'l' from the list. We then insert a question mark at the index of the removed string using the insert() method, which inserts a question mark at index 5 in the list. Finally, we remove the question mark from the list using the remove() method, which removes the question mark from the list. We then join the list back into a string using the join() method, which returns the string 'sjbrfqmw'.
<<<Output>>>
'sjbrfqmw'
