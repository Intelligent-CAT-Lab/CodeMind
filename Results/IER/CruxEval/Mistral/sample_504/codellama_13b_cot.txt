<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of values as input and sorts the list in ascending order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1, 1], we need to sort the list in ascending order.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1, 1] is [1, 1, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 1]
