The function f takes a string text as input and returns the number of lines in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "ncdsdfdaaa0a1cdscsk*XFd", we need to split the string into lines and count the number of lines.
The string "ncdsdfdaaa0a1cdscsk*XFd" has 3 lines.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "ncdsdfdaaa0a1cdscsk*XFd" is 3.
