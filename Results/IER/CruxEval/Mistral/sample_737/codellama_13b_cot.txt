The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns the number of integers in the list that are decimal numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, 2, -1, -2], we need to check if each integer in the list is a decimal number.
The integers 0, 6, and 2 are decimal numbers, so we increment the count by 1.
The integers -1 and -2 are not decimal numbers, so we do not increment the count.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, 2, -1, -2] is 3.
