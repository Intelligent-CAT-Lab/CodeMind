<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and chars.
If chars is not empty, it removes all occurrences of chars from the beginning and end of the text using the rstrip() method.
If chars is empty, it removes all occurrences of spaces from the beginning and end of the text using the rstrip() method.
If the resulting text is an empty string, it returns '-'.
Otherwise, it returns the text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2' and the argument '0123456789-', we need to remove all occurrences of '0123456789-' from the beginning and end of the text.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2' and the argument '0123456789-' is '-'.
<<<Output>>>
'-'
