<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string s and a character ch. It returns the string s with all occurrences of ch removed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'shivajimonto6' and the character '6', we need to remove all occurrences of '6' from the string 'shivajimonto6'.
The first occurrence of '6' is at index 4, so we partition the string at index 4 and take the last two elements of the resulting list, which are '6' and '6'.
We then reverse the order of these elements to get '66'.
We repeat this process for all occurrences of '6' in the string, resulting in the final string 'shivajimonto'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'shivajimonto6' and the character '6' is 'shivajimonto'.
<<<Output>>>
'shivajimonto'
