<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function first calculates the length of the list using the len() function and stores it in a variable called count.
Then, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list nums and extract every second element of the list.
The resulting list is then used to append every second element of the original list nums to the new list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]] is [0, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1]
