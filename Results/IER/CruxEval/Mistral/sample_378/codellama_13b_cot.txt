The function f takes two arguments: a dictionary dic and a key.
First, it converts the dictionary dic to an immutable dictionary using the dict() function.
Then, it removes the key from the dictionary using the pop() method and returns the value associated with the key.
If the key is not found in the dictionary, it returns the string "No such key!".
Next, it removes all the key-value pairs from the dictionary using the popitem() method and returns the value of the last key-value pair.
Finally, it converts the value to an integer and returns it.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input dictionary {did: 0} and key 'u', we first convert the dictionary to an immutable dictionary using the dict() function.
Then, we remove the key 'u' from the dictionary using the pop() method and return the value associated with the key, which is 0.
Next, we remove all the key-value pairs from the dictionary using the popitem() method and return the value of the last key-value pair, which is 0.
Finally, we convert the value to an integer and return it, which is 0.
