<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list and an operation. It creates a new list by taking a copy of the input list using the `[:]` slicing syntax. It then sorts the new list using the `sort()` method. Finally, it applies the given operation to the sorted new list using the `operation()` function.
In this case, the input list is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]` and the operation is a lambda function that reverses the elements of the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]` and the operation `(lambda x: x.reverse())` is a new list with the elements reversed, which is `[15, 8, 2, 4, 6]`.
<<<Output>>>
[15, 8, 2, 4, 6]
