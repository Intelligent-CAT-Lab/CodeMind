<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string name as input and returns a string with the following format:
| name |
The function first splits the input string name into a list of words using the split() method.
Then, it uses the join() method to concatenate the words in the list with a space in between.
Finally, it returns the concatenated string with the "|" and "|" characters on either side.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "i am your father", we first split the input string into a list of words:
['i', 'am', 'your', 'father']
Then, we use the join() method to concatenate the words in the list with a space in between:
'i am your father'
Finally, we return the concatenated string with the "|" and "|" characters on either side:
'| i am your father |'
<<<Output>>>
'| i am your father |'
