The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function iterates through each element in the list nums using a for loop.
For each element in the list, the function checks if the element is divisible by 3 using the modulo operator (%).
If the element is divisible by 3, the function appends the element to the end of the list nums.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 3] is [3].
