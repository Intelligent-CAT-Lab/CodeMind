The function f takes a string s as input and returns the sum of the number of words in s that are capitalized.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!", we need to split the string into words, check if each word is capitalized, and then sum the number of capitalized words.
The string "SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!" has 5 words: "SOME", "OF", "THIS", "IS", and "unknowN!".
Out of these 5 words, only "THIS" and "unknowN!" are capitalized.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!" is 2.
