<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: text, old, and new.
If the length of old is greater than 3, the function returns the original text.
If old is in the text and there is no space in the text, the function replaces all occurrences of old with new multiplied by the length of old.
If old is in the text, the function replaces all occurrences of old with new until there are no more occurrences of old in the text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'avacado', 'va', '-', we need to check if 'va' is in the text 'avacado' and if there is no space in the text.
Since 'va' is in the text 'avacado' and there is no space in the text, the function replaces all occurrences of 'va' with '-va' multiplied by the length of 'va'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'avacado', 'va', '-' is '-avacado'.
<<<Output>>>
'-avacado'
