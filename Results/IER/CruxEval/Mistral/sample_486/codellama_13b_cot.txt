<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary dic as input and returns a new dictionary dic_op.
The function first creates a copy of dic using the `copy()` method.
Then, it iterates over the items in dic using a for loop.
For each item, it multiplies the value by itself and adds the resulting key-value pair to dic_op.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {1:1, 2:2, 3:3} is {1:1, 2:4, 3:9}.
<<<Output>>>
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
