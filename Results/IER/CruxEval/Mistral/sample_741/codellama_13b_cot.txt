<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of integers nums and an integer p.
The function first sets the variable prev\_p to p - 1.
If prev\_p is less than 0, it is set to len(nums) - 1.
Then, the function returns the element at index prev\_p in the list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7] and p = 6, we need to find the element at index prev\_p = 6 - 1 = 5 in the list [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7] and p = 6 is 5.
