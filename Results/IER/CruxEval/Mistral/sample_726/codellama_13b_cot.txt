<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a tuple containing two values: the number of whitespace characters in the string and the length of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds", we need to count the number of whitespace characters in the string and the length of the string.
The string contains 11 whitespace characters and 21 characters in total.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds" is (11, 21).
<<<Output>>>
(11, 21)
