The function f takes two inputs: an array and an element.
The element is first converted to a string using the built-in str() function.
Then, a variable d is initialized to 0.
A for loop is used to iterate over each element in the array.
Inside the loop, the str() function is used again to convert the current element to a string.
If the string of the current element is equal to the string of the input element, the value of d is incremented by 1.
Finally, the function returns the value of d.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2] and the input element 2, we need to iterate over each element in the array and check if its string representation is equal to the string representation of the input element.
Since the string representation of the input element 2 is "2", we will increment the value of d by 1 whenever we encounter the element 2 in the array.
Since the element 2 appears twice in the array, the value of d will be incremented by 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input array [-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2] and the input element 2 is 2.
