<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string text and a character char. It initializes a variable position to the length of the text.
If the character char is in the text, it finds the position of the character using the index() method and assigns it to the variable position.
If the position of the character is greater than 1, it calculates the new position by adding 1 to the position and taking the remainder of the result divided by the length of the text.
Finally, the function returns the position.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'wduhzxlfk' and 'w', we need to find the position of the character 'w' in the text 'wduhzxlfk'.
The character 'w' is in the text 'wduhzxlfk' at position 1.
Since the position of the character is greater than 1, we calculate the new position by adding 1 to the position and taking the remainder of the result divided by the length of the text.
The new position is (1 + 1) % 10 = 2.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input 'wduhzxlfk' and 'w' is 2.
