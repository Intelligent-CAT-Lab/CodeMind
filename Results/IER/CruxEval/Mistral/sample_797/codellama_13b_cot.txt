<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary dct as input and returns a list of tuples.
For each key in the dictionary, the function appends a tuple containing the key and its corresponding value to the list lst.
The keys are sorted before being processed, so the list will be sorted in alphabetical order.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input { 'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3 } is [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)].
<<<Output>>>
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
