<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and reverses the order of the elements in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3], we need to reverse the order of the elements in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3] is [3, 6, 2, 7, -3, -9, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[3, 6, 2, 7, -3, -9, 1]
