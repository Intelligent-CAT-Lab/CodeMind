<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input and returns a list of integers.
The function first initializes an empty list digits.
Then, it iterates through each number in nums.
For each number, it checks if it is a string and is numeric, or if it is an integer.
If the number is a string and is numeric, or if it is an integer, it appends the number to the digits list.
After the iteration, the digits list is converted to a list of integers using the map function.
Finally, the function returns the list of integers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, '1', '2', 0], we need to check if each number is a string and is numeric, or if it is an integer.
Since '1' and '2' are strings and are numeric, they are appended to the digits list.
The other numbers are not strings or are not numeric, so they are not appended to the digits list.
Therefore, the digits list is [1, 2].
The digits list is then converted to a list of integers using the map function, resulting in [1, 2].
The function returns the list of integers [1, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2]
