<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary ets as input and returns a new dictionary where the values of each key in the input dictionary are squared.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {}, we need to square the values of each key in the input dictionary.
Since the input dictionary is empty, the output of executing the function f on the input {} is an empty dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{}
