<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: total and arg.
If the type of arg is a list, the function iterates through each element in the list and extends the total list with each element.
If the type of arg is not a list, the function simply extends the total list with the arg.
Therefore, when we call the function f with the arguments [1, 2, 3] and 'nammo', the function iterates through the list [1, 2, 3] and extends the total list with each element.
The resulting total list is [1, 2, 3, 'nammo'].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 'nammo']
