<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the input list and the values are the sublists of the input list that contain the integer.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 2, 7, 2, 3, 5], we need to create a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the input list and the values are the sublists of the input list that contain the integer.
The dictionary will be:
{5: [5], 2: [2], 7: [7], 3: [3]}
The output of the function f will be the string representation of this dictionary with spaces removed.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 2, 7, 2, 3, 5] is "52723".
<<<Output>>>
'52723'
