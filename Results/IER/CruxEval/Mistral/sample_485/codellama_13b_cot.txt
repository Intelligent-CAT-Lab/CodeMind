The function f takes a string of tokens as input and splits it into a list of tokens using the split() method.
If the length of the list of tokens is 2, the function reverses the order of the tokens using the reversed() function.
Then, the function uses the ljust() method to pad the first token with spaces to a length of 5 characters and the second token with spaces to a length of 5 characters.
Finally, the function uses the join() method to concatenate the padded tokens with a space in between.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "gsd avdropj", we first split the input string into a list of tokens using the split() method.
The list of tokens is ['gsd', 'avdropj'].
Since the length of the list of tokens is 2, the function reverses the order of the tokens to ['avdropj', 'gsd'].
Then, the function pads the first token 'avdropj' with spaces to a length of 5 characters and the second token 'gsd' with spaces to a length of 5 characters.
The padded tokens are ['avdropj ', 'gsd '].
Finally, the function concatenates the padded tokens with a space in between using the join() method.
The output of executing the function f on the input "gsd avdropj" is "avdropj gsd ".
<<<Output>>>
'avdropj gsd '
