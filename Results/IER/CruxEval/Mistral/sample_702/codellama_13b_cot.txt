<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function first calculates the length of the list using the len() function and stores it in a variable called count.
Then, the function uses a for loop to iterate over the list from the second to last element to the first element.
Inside the loop, the function uses the pop() method to remove the first element of the list and the insert() method to insert it at the current index i.
This effectively reverses the order of the elements in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, -5, -4] is [0, -4, -5].
<<<Output>>>
[0, -4, -5]
