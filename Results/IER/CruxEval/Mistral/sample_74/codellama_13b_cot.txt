<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a list lst, an integer i, and an integer n. It inserts the integer n at the index i of the list lst.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99], 4, 15, we need to insert 15 at index 4 of the list [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99], 4, 15 is [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99, 15].
<<<Output>>>
[44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99, 15]
