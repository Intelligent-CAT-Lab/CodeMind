The function f takes a list arr as input and returns a new list.
First, it creates a new list n that contains only the even numbers from the input list arr.
Then, it creates a new list m by concatenating n with arr.
Next, it iterates over the elements in m and removes any elements that are not in n.
Finally, it returns the resulting list m.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list [3, 6, 4, -2, 5], we first create a new list n that contains only the even numbers from the input list, which is [6, 4].
Then, we create a new list m by concatenating n with the input list, which is [6, 4, 3, 6, 4, -2, 5].
Next, we iterate over the elements in m and remove any elements that are not in n. This leaves us with the list [6, 4, 3, 4].
Finally, we return the resulting list [6, 4, 3, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[6, 4, 3, 4]
