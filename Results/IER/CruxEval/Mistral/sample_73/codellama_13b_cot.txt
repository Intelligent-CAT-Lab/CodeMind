<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string row as input and returns a tuple containing the number of occurrences of the string "1" and the number of occurrences of the string "0" in the input string row.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "100010010", we need to count the number of occurrences of the string "1" and the number of occurrences of the string "0" in the input string "100010010".
The number of occurrences of the string "1" in the input string "100010010" is 5.
The number of occurrences of the string "0" in the input string "100010010" is 5.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "100010010" is (5, 5).
<<<Output>>>
(5, 5)
