<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of integers nums and an integer number. It returns the number of times the number appears in the list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [12, 0, 13, 4, 12] and the number 12, we need to count the number of times 12 appears in the list [12, 0, 13, 4, 12].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [12, 0, 13, 4, 12] and the number 12 is 2.
