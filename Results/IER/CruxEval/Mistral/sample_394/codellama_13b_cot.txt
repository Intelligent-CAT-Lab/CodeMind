<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the index of the first empty line in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "2 m2 \n\nbike", we need to split the string into lines using the splitlines() method.
The resulting list of lines is ['2 m2', '\nbike'].
The function then iterates through the list of lines and checks if each line is empty.
The first empty line is found at index 1, so the function returns 1.
