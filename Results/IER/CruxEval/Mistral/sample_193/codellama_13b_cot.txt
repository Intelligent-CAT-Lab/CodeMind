The function f takes a string as input and performs the following operations:

1. It counts the number of occurrences of the character ':' in the string using the count() method.
2. It replaces all occurrences of the character ':' with an empty string using the replace() method.
3. It subtracts 1 from the count of occurrences of the character ':' to get the number of occurrences of the character ':' that were replaced.

For the input '1::1', the function first counts the number of occurrences of the character ':' which is 2. Then it replaces all occurrences of the character ':' with an empty string, resulting in the string '1'. Finally, it subtracts 1 from the count of occurrences of the character ':' which gives 1.

Therefore, the return value of the function f on the input '1::1' is '1'.
