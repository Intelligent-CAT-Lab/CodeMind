<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function first calculates the length of the list nums and stores it in a variable called count.
Then, it uses a for loop to iterate over the list nums from the second to last element to the first element.
Inside the loop, the function removes the first two elements of the list nums using the pop() method and adds their sum to the end of the list nums using the insert() method.
Finally, the function returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list [-5, 3, -2, -3, -1, 3, 5], we need to apply the function to the input list.
The output of the function f on the input list [-5, 3, -2, -3, -1, 3, 5] is [1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17]
