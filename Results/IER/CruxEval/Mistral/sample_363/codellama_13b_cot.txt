<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function first sorts the list nums in ascending order using the sort() method.
Then, it calculates the length of the list nums and stores it in the variable n.
The function then creates a new list new\_nums by selecting the middle element of the sorted list nums.
If the length of the list nums is even, the function selects the two middle elements of the sorted list nums.
Then, the function inserts the first half of the sorted list nums into the new\_nums list in reverse order using the insert() method.
Finally, the function appends the second half of the sorted list nums into the new\_nums list in order using the append() method.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input [1] is [1].
<<<Output>>>
[1]
