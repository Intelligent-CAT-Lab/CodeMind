<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and removes all even numbers from the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 3, 3, 7], we need to remove all even numbers from the list.
The even numbers in the list are 3 and 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 3, 3, 7] is [5, 7].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 7]
