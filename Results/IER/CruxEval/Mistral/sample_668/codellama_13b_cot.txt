<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the concatenation of the last character of the string with the rest of the string (excluding the last character).
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hellomyfriendear", we need to concatenate the last character "r" with the rest of the string "hellomyfriendear" (excluding the last character "r").
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hellomyfriendear" is "rhellomyfriendear".
<<<Output>>>
'rhellomyfriendear'
