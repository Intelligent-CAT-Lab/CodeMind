The function f takes two arguments: a list of integers nums and an integer n. It returns the integer at index n in the list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list [[-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4], 6], we need to access the integer at index 6 in the list.
Since the list has 7 elements, the integer at index 6 is the 7th element, which is 4.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input list [[-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4], 6] is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
