The function f takes a string txt as input and returns the formatted string using the `format()` method.
The `format()` method takes a variable number of arguments, which are used to format the string.
In this case, the function takes a single argument `txt`, which is a string.
The function uses the `*` operator to unpack the arguments passed to the `format()` method.
The `*` operator is used to convert a variable number of arguments into a tuple, which is then unpacked using the `*` operator.
The function then uses the `format()` method to format the string using the tuple of arguments.
The `format()` method uses placeholders in the string to insert the values of the arguments.
The placeholders are enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
The function uses the `*` operator to repeat the placeholder `{}` for each argument in the tuple.
The function then returns the formatted string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "5123807309875480094949830", we need to format the string using the `format()` method.
