<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an array and an integer n. It returns a new array that contains all the elements of the original array starting from the index n and going to the end of the array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2] and the index 4, we need to extract all the elements of the array starting from index 4 and going to the end of the array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input array [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2] and the index 4 is [2, 2, 2, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 2, 2, 2]
