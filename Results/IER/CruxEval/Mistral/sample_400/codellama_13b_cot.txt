<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string multi_string as input and returns a string.
The function first splits the multi_string into a list of strings using the split() method.
Then, it applies the map() function to each string in the list, which applies the str.isascii() function to each string.
The map() function returns a list of True/False values, indicating whether each string in the list is a valid ASCII string or not.
The function then checks if True is in the list of values returned by map().
If True is in the list, the function returns a string formed by joining the list of valid ASCII strings with commas using the join() method.
If True is not in the list, the function returns an empty string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "I am hungry! eat food.", we need to split the string into a list of strings, apply the map() function to each string, and check if True is in the list of values returned by map().
Since "I am hungry!" is not a valid ASCII string, the map() function returns a list of False values.
Since True is not in the list, the function returns an empty string.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input "I am hungry! eat food." is an empty string.
