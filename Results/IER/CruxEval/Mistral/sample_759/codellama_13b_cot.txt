The function f takes two arguments: text and sub. It initializes an empty list called index and a variable called starting to 0.
The while loop runs until starting is equal to -1. In each iteration of the loop, the function finds the first occurrence of sub in the text starting from the index of the previous occurrence of sub. If a match is found, the index of the match is added to the index list and the starting index is updated to the index of the match plus the length of sub.
The function returns the index list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'egmdartoa' and 'good', we need to find all occurrences of the substring 'good' in the text 'egmdartoa'.
The first occurrence of 'good' is at index 10. The second occurrence of 'good' is at index 21.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input 'egmdartoa' and 'good' is [10, 21].
<<<Output>>>
[10, 21]
