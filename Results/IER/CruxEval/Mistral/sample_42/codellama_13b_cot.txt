<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function first clears the list nums using the clear() method.
Then, it loops through each number in nums and appends the number multiplied by 2 to the new list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2] is [8, 6, 4, 2, 4, -2, 8, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[8, 6, 4, 2, 4, -2, 8, 4]
