<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string str as input and returns the concatenation of the substrings before and after the substring "ar" in the string str.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "xxxarmmarxx", we need to find the substring "ar" in the string and then concatenate the substrings before and after it.
The substring "ar" is located at index 3 in the string "xxxarmmarxx".
The substrings before and after "ar" are "xxx" and "marxx", respectively.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "xxxarmmarxx" is "xxx marxx".
<<<Output>>>
'xxx marxx'
