<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a list of integers.
The function iterates through the list of integers from the end to the second element, with a step of -3.
For each element, if the element is 0, the function clears the list and returns False.
If the element is not 0, the function continues to the next element.
If the loop completes without finding a 0 element, the function returns the list.
Therefore, for the input [0, 0, 1, 2, 1], the function will iterate through the list and find the 0 element at index 2.
Since the function clears the list and returns False, the return value of f([0, 0, 1, 2, 1]) is an empty list.
