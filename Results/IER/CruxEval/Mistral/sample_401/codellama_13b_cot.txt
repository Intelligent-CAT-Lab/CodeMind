<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and suffix.
The function checks if the suffix is present in the text and if the text ends with the suffix.
If both conditions are true, the function returns the text without the suffix.
If either of the conditions is false, the function returns the text as is.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'mathematics' and 'example', we need to check if the suffix 'example' is present in the text 'mathematics' and if the text 'mathematics' ends with the suffix 'example'.
Since the suffix 'example' is not present in the text 'mathematics' and the text 'mathematics' does not end with the suffix 'example', the function returns the text 'mathematics' as is.
<<<Output>>>
'mathematics'
