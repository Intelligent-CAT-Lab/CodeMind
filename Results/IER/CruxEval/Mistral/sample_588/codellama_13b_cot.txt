<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of items and a target value. It checks if the target value is present in the list of items. If it is, it returns the index of the target value in the list of items. If it is not, it returns -1.
To determine the return value of executing the function f on the input ['1', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+'], we need to check if the target value '**' is present in the list of items.
Since '**' is present in the list of items, the function f returns the index of '**' in the list of items, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
