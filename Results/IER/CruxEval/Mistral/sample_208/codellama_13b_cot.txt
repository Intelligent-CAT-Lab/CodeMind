<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of items as input and returns a new list containing only the non-digit characters from each item in the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list ['123', 'cat', 'd dee'], we need to iterate through each item in the list and check if each character in the item is a digit. If a character is not a digit, we append it to a new list called result.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list ['123', 'cat', 'd dee'] is ['c', 't', 'd', 'e'].
<<<Output>>>
['c', 't', 'd', 'e']
