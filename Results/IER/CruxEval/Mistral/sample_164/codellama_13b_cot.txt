<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and returns the first three elements of the sorted list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 1, 3, 0], we first need to sort the list.
The sorted list is [0, 1, 3, 5, 8].
Then we need to select the first three elements of the sorted list, which are [0, 1, 3].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 1, 3, 0] is [0, 1, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 3]
