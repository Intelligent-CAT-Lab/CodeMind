<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns a tuple of two boolean values.
The first boolean value is True if the two dictionaries r['c'] and r['d'] are identical, and False otherwise.
The second boolean value is True if the two dictionaries r['c'] and r['d'] are equal, and False otherwise.
To determine the return value of executing the function f on the input { 'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets' }, we need to create a dictionary r with two keys 'c' and 'd' and assign the input dictionary d to both keys.
Then we check if the two dictionaries r['c'] and r['d'] are identical and equal.
Since the two dictionaries are identical and equal, the first boolean value is True and the second boolean value is True.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input { 'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets' } is (True, True).
<<<Output>>>
(True, True)
