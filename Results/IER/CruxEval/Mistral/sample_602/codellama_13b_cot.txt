The function f takes two arguments: a list of integers nums and an integer target. It counts the number of occurrences of the target integer in the list nums using the count() method of the list object. Then it multiplies the count by 2 and returns the result.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list [1, 1] and target 1, we need to count the number of occurrences of 1 in the list [1, 1]. The count() method returns 1 since there is only one occurrence of 1 in the list. Then we multiply the count by 2, which gives us 2. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list [1, 1] and target 1 is 2.
