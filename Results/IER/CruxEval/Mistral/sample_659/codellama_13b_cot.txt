The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns the length of a new list of strings that are formed by taking the first two characters of each string and the last three characters of each string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list ['yR?TAJhIW?n', 'o11BgEFDfoe', 'KnHdn2vdEd', 'wvwruuqfhXbGis'], we need to iterate through each string in the list and extract the first two characters and the last three characters.
We can then append the resulting strings to a new list called clean.
The final output of the function is the length of the clean list.
