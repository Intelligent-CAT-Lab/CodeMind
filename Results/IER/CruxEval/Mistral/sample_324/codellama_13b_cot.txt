The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function first creates two copies of the input list nums, one in ascending order and the other in descending order.
It then reverses the order of the ascending list and selects the first half of the descending list.
Finally, it concatenates the three lists in the order of descending, ascending, and descending.
To determine the output of executing the function f on an empty list [], we need to create two copies of the empty list, one in ascending order and the other in descending order.
Since an empty list has no elements, the ascending and descending lists will also be empty.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on an empty list [] is an empty list [].
