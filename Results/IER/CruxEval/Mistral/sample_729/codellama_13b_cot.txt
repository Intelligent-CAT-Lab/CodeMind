<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings s1 and s2 as input and returns a list of indices of s2 in s1.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'abcdefghabc' and 'abc', we need to find the indices of 'abc' in 'abcdefghabc'.
The first occurrence of 'abc' in 'abcdefghabc' is at index 0.
The second occurrence of 'abc' in 'abcdefghabc' is at index 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'abcdefghabc' and 'abc' is [0, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 3]
