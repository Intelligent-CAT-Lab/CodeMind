<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
For each integer in the list nums, the function squares the integer and inserts the squared integer at the same index in the list nums.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list [1, 2, 4] is [1, 4, 16].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 16]
