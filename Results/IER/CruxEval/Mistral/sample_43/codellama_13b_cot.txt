<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer n as input and iterates over each digit of n. For each digit, it checks if it is a digit using the isdigit() method. If any non-digit character is found, the function sets n to -1 and breaks out of the loop.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "6 ** 2", we need to convert the input to an integer and then iterate over its digits.
Since "6 ** 2" is equal to 36, the function will iterate over the digits of 36.
Since all digits in 36 are digits, the function will not set n to -1 and will not break out of the loop.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input "6 ** 2" is 36.
<<<Output>>>
36
