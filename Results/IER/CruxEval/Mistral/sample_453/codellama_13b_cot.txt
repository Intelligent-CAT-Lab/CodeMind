<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string and a character c. It returns True if the string ends with the character c, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'wrschxjmb8' and the character 'c', we need to check if the string 'wrschxjmb8' ends with the character 'c'.
Since the string 'wrschxjmb8' does not end with the character 'c', the function f returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
