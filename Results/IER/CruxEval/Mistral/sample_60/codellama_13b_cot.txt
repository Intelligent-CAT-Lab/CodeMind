<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string doc as input and returns the first capitalized letter of the first alphabetic character in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "raruwa", we need to iterate through each character in the string and check if it is an alphabetic character.
The first alphabetic character in the string "raruwa" is "r".
Since "r" is not an alphabetic character, the function returns "-".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "raruwa" is "-".
<<<Output>>>
'-'
