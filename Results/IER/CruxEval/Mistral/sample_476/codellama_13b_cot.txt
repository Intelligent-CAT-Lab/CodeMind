The function f takes two arguments: a string a and a string split\_on. It splits the string a into a list of words using the split() method, and then iterates through each word in the list. For each word, it iterates through each character in the word and appends each character to a new list called a.
Then, it checks if the string split\_on is in the list a. If it is, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "booty boot-boot bootclass" and the argument "k", we first split the string "booty boot-boot bootclass" into a list of words using the split() method. The resulting list is ["booty", "boot", "boot", "bootclass"].
Then, we iterate through each word in the list and iterate through each character in the word. For each character, we append it to the list a. The resulting list a is ["b", "o", "o", "t", "y", "b", "o", "o", "t", "b", "o", "o", "t", "c", "l", "a", "s", "s"].
Finally, we check if the string "k" is in the list a. Since "k" is not in the list a, the function returns False.
