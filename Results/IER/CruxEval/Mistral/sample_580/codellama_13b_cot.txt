<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string text and a character char. It initializes a new string variable new\_text to be equal to the input text. It also initializes an empty list variable a.
The function then enters a while loop that continues until the character char is no longer present in the new\_text string.
Inside the loop, the function appends the index of the first occurrence of the character char in the new\_text string to the list a. It then replaces the first occurrence of the character char in the new\_text string with an empty string using the replace() method.
After the loop completes, the function returns the list a, which contains the indices of all occurrences of the character char in the input text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'rvr' and the character 'r', we need to find the indices of all occurrences of the character 'r' in the input string 'rvr'.
The character 'r' appears twice in the input string 'rvr', at indices 1 and 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'rvr' and the character 'r' is [1, 2].

[1, 2]
