<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list m as input and reverses the order of its elements using the reverse() method.
Then, the function returns the reversed list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list [-4, 6, 0, 4, -7, 2, -1], we need to reverse the order of its elements.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list [-4, 6, 0, 4, -7, 2, -1] is [ -1, -2, -7, -4, 0, 6, -4 ].
<<<Output>>>
[ -1, -2, -7, -4, 0, 6, -4 ]
