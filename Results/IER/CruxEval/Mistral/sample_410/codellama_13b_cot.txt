<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function iterates through each element in the list nums using a for loop.
For each element in the list, the function inserts the element at the beginning of the list using the insert() method.
The variable a is used to keep track of the index of the element to be inserted.
The loop continues until the end of the list is reached.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list [1, 3, -1, 1, -2, 6] is [1, 3, -1, 1, -2, 6, 1, 3, -1, 1, -2, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, -1, 1, -2, 6, 1, 3, -1, 1, -2, 6]
