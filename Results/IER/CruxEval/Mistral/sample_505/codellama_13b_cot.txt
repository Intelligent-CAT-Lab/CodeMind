<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and returns the last non-alphabetic character in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "--4/0-209", we need to iterate through the characters in the string and check if the last character is a non-alphabetic character.
The last character in the string is '-', which is a non-alphabetic character.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "--4/0-209" is '-'.
<<<Output>>>
'-'
