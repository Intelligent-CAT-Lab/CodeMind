The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function first finds the maximum value in the list nums using the built-in max function.
Then, it iterates through the list nums from the maximum value to the first element using a for loop.
Inside the loop, the function reverses the current sublist of nums using the built-in reverse function.
Finally, the function returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [43, 0, 4, 77, 5, 2, 0, 9, 77], we need to reverse the sublist of nums starting from the maximum value (77) to the first element (43).
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [43, 0, 4, 77, 5, 2, 0, 9, 77] is [77, 9, 77, 5, 4, 2, 0, 0, 43].
<<<Output>>>
[77, 9, 77, 5, 4, 2, 0, 0, 43]
