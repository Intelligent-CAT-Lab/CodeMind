<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and processes it by splitting it into individual items using the split() method. It then replaces each item in the text with a space on both sides of the item using the replace() method. Finally, it removes any leading or trailing spaces using the strip() method.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-", we need to split the input string into individual items, replace each item with a space on both sides, and remove any leading or trailing spaces.
The output of executing the function f on the input "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-" is "stew corn and beans in soup".
<<<Output>>>
'stew corn and beans in soup'
