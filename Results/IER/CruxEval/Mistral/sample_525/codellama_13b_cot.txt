The function f takes three arguments: a dictionary c, a string st, and an integer ed.
The function creates an empty dictionary d and two variables a and b, initialized to 0.
The function then iterates over the items in the dictionary c, and for each item, it adds the value to the dictionary d with the key as the value.
If the value of the item is equal to st, the variable a is assigned the value of the key.
If the value of the item is equal to ed, the variable b is assigned the value of the key.
After the loop, the function retrieves the value of st from the dictionary d and returns a tuple of the form (w, b) if a is greater than b, or (b, w) otherwise.
To determine the return value of executing the function f on the input { 'TEXT': 7, 'CODE': 3 }, st = 7, and ed = 3, we need to iterate over the items in the dictionary c, add the values to the dictionary d, and retrieve the values of st and ed.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input { 'TEXT': 7, 'CODE': 3 }, st = 7, and ed = 3 is (7, 3).
<<<Output>>>
(7, 3)
