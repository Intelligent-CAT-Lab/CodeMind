<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: values, text, and markers.
The function uses the rstrip() method to remove the values and markers from the beginning and end of the text, respectively.
The rstrip() method removes all occurrences of the specified substring from the beginning and end of the string.
Therefore, the function f removes all occurrences of the values and markers from the beginning and end of the text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '2Pn', 'yCxpg2C2Pny2', and '', we need to remove all occurrences of '2Pn' and '' from the beginning and end of the text 'yCxpg2C2Pny2'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '2Pn', 'yCxpg2C2Pny2', and '' is 'yCxpg2Pny2'.
<<<Output>>>
'yCxpg2Pny2'
