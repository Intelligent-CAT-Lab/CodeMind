<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of integers nums and an integer index.
It returns the remainder of nums[index] divided by 42 plus nums.pop(index) multiplied by 2.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 2, 0, 3, 7] and index 3, we need to:
1. Get the element at index 3 of the list, which is 3.
2. Divide 3 by 42, which gives a remainder of 1.
3. Pop the element at index 3 from the list, which is 3.
4. Multiply 3 by 2, which gives a result of 6.
5. Add 1 and 6, which gives a result of 7.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input [3, 2, 0, 3, 7] and index 3 is 7.
