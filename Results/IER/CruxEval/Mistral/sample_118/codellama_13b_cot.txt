<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and chars. It initializes two variables: num\_applies and extra\_chars.
The variable num\_applies is set to 2, indicating that the function will apply the chars to the text two times.
The variable extra\_chars is initially set to an empty string.
The function then enters a for loop that iterates num\_applies times.
Inside the loop, extra\_chars is concatenated with chars using the += operator.
Then, the text is replaced with the new string obtained by removing the extra\_chars from the text using the replace() method.
Finally, the function returns the text after all the extra\_chars have been removed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'zbzquiuqnmfkx' and 'mk', we need to apply the chars 'mk' to the text 'zbzquiuqnmfkx' two times.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'zbzquiuqnmfkx' and 'mk' is 'zqiuqnmfkx'.
<<<Output>>>
'zqiuqnmfkx'
