<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string.
The new string is created by iterating over each character in the lowercase and stripped version of the input string.
If the character is a number or one of the special characters 'ÄäÏïÖöÜü', it is added to the new string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '' is an empty string.
