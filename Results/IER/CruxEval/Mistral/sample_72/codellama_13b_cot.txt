<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns True if all characters in the string are numeric, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "99", we need to check if all characters in the string are numeric.
Since the string "99" consists of only numeric characters, the function returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
