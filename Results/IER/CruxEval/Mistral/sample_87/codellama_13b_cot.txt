The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and reverses the order of the elements in the list using the reverse() method.
Then, it applies the map() function to convert each element of the reversed list to a string using the str() function.
Finally, it uses the join() method to concatenate all the strings into a single string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [ -1, 9, 3, 1, -2 ], we first reverse the order of the elements in the list using the reverse() method.
Then, we apply the map() function to convert each element of the reversed list to a string using the str() function.
Finally, we use the join() method to concatenate all the strings into a single string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [ -1, 9, 3, 1, -2 ] is "-19312".
<<<Output>>>
'-19312'
