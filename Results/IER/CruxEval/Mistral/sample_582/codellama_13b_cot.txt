<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, k and j. It creates an empty list called arr and then uses a for loop to append j to the list k times.
Therefore, when k is 7 and j is 5, the function will append 5 to the list 7 times, resulting in the list [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
