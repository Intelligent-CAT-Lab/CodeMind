<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of integers nums and an integer i. It removes the element at index i from the list nums using the pop() method and returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list [35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47] and index 0, we need to remove the first element from the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list [35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47] and index 0 is [45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47].
<<<Output>>>
[45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]
