The function f takes three arguments: n, m, and num. It creates a list of integers from n to m (inclusive) using the range function and converts it to a list using the list() function. It then initializes a variable j to 0 and enters an infinite loop.
Inside the loop, j is incremented by num and the remainder of j divided by the length of the x\_list is taken. If the remainder of j divided by the length of the x\_list is 0, the function returns x\_list[j].
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (46, 48, 21), we need to create a list of integers from 46 to 48 (inclusive) using the range function and convert it to a list using the list() function. We then initialize j to 0 and enter an infinite loop.
Inside the loop, j is incremented by 21 and the remainder of j divided by 3 is taken. Since the remainder of 21 divided by 3 is 2, j is equal to 2. Since x\_list[2] is 3, the function returns 3.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input (46, 48, 21) is 3.
