<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string of sentences as input and returns the string "oscillating" if all the sentences in the string are decimal numbers, and "not oscillating" otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "not numbers", we need to check if all the sentences in the string are decimal numbers.
Since the input string does not contain any decimal numbers, the condition `all([sentence.isdecimal() for sentence in sentences.split('.')])` will return False.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input "not numbers" is "not oscillating".
<<<Output>>>
'not oscillating'
