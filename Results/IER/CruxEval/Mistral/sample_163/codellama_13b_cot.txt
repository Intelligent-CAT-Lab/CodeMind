<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: text, space\_symbol, and size.
The function first calculates the number of spaces needed to align the text to the desired size by subtracting the length of the text from the size.
It then generates the number of spaces required by joining the space\_symbol for the number of times equal to the calculated number of spaces.
Finally, it returns the text concatenated with the generated spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'w', '))', 7), we need to align the text 'w' to the right with the space\_symbol '))' to a length of 7 characters.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'w', '))', 7) is 'w))'.
<<<Output>>>
'w))'
