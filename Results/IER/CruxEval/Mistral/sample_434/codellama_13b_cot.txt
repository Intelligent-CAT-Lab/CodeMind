The function f takes a string as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the letter 'e' in the string.
If the letter 'e' is not found in the string, the function returns the string "Nuk".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "eeuseeeoehasa", we need to find the index of the first occurrence of the letter 'e' in the string.
The first occurrence of the letter 'e' in the string is at index 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "eeuseeeoehasa" is 1.
