<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a list of the frequency of each character in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "URW rNB", we need to count the frequency of each character in the string.
The character frequency count is as follows:
- U: 1
- R: 1
- W: 1
- r: 1
- N: 1
- B: 1
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "URW rNB" is [('a', 1), ('b', 1), ('c', 1), ('d', 1), ('e', 1), ('f', 1), ('U', 1), ('R', 1), ('W', 1), ('r', 1), ('N', 1), ('B', 1)].
<<<Output>>>
[('a', 1), ('b', 1), ('c', 1), ('d', 1), ('e', 1), ('f', 1), ('U', 1), ('R', 1), ('W', 1), ('r', 1), ('N', 1), ('B', 1)]
