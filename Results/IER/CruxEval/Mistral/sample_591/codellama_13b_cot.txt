The function f takes a list of integers arr as input and returns a tuple of two lists.
The first list counts is a list of length 9, where each element represents the count of a specific integer in the input list arr.
The second list ans is a list of integers that represent the indices of the integers in the input list arr that appear more than once.
To determine the return value of executing the function f on the input list [6, 3, 0, 7, 4, 8], we need to count the occurrences of each integer in the input list and find the indices of the integers that appear more than once.
The count of each integer in the input list is:
- 6: 1
- 3: 1
- 0: 1
- 7: 1
- 4: 1
- 8: 1
Therefore, the first list counts is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
To find the indices of the integers that appear more than once, we need to iterate over the count list and find the indices of the elements that are greater than 0.
The indices of the integers that appear more than once are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Therefore, the second list ans is [2, 3, 4, 5].
The return value of the function f on the input list [6, 3, 0, 7, 4, 8] is ([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 3, 4, 5]).
