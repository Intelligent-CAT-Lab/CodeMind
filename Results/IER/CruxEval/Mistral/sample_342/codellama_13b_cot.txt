<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns True if the number of occurrences of the character '-' in the string is equal to the length of the string, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "---123-4", we need to count the number of occurrences of the character '-' in the string and compare it to the length of the string.
The string "---123-4" has 4 occurrences of the character '-' and a length of 7.
Since the number of occurrences of the character '-' is not equal to the length of the string, the function f returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
