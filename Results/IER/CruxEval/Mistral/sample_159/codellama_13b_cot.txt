<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string st as input and returns a new string with the characters in st swapped to their uppercase or lowercase counterparts.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "RTiGM", we need to iterate over the characters in the string in reverse order and swap their case.
The resulting string would be "rTiGm".
<<<Output>>>
'rTiGm'
