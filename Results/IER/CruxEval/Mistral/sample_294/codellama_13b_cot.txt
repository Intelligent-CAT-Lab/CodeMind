<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: n, m, and text.
The function first checks if the text is empty. If it is empty, the function returns the text.
If the text is not empty, the function extracts the first, middle, and last characters of the text and replaces the nth character in each of them with the mth character.
The function then concatenates the three characters together to form the output.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris", we need to replace the 2nd character with the 5th character, the 3rd character with the 3rd character, and the 1st character with the 1st character.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris" is "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris".
<<<Output>>>
'2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris'
