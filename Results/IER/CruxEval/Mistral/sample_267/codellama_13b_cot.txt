<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and space.
If space is less than 0, the function returns the text.
Otherwise, the function uses the left-justify method to pad the text with spaces to make it centered.
The length of the padded text is calculated as the length of the text divided by 2 plus the space.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input 'sowpf' and space -7 is the string 'sowpf' with 7 spaces added to the left.
<<<Output>>>
'sowpf   '
