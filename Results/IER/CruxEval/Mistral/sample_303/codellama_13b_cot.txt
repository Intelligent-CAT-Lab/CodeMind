<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string with all the characters in text converted to lowercase and duplicates removed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "mJkLbn", we need to first convert all the characters to lowercase.
The resulting string is "mjklbn".
Next, we need to remove duplicates from the string.
The resulting string after removing duplicates is "mjklb".
Finally, we need to join the resulting string back into a single string.
The output of executing the function f on the input "mJkLbn" is "mjklb".
<<<Output>>>
'mjklb'
