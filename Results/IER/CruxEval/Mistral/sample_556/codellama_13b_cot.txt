The function f takes a string text as input and replaces all occurrences of a space character with a tab character. It then expands the tabs to four spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "\n\n\t\tz\td\ng\n\t\t\te", we need to replace all occurrences of a space character with a tab character.
The resulting string is "\t\t\t\t\tz\td\ng\n\t\t\te".
Then, the function expands the tabs to four spaces, resulting in the final output string "\t\t\t\t\tz\td\ng\n\t\t\te".
<<<Output>>>
"\t\t\t\t\tz\td\ng\n\t\t\te"
