The function f takes an integer number as input and returns a list of keys from a dictionary transl that are divisible by the input number.
The dictionary transl has the following keys and values:
- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4
- E: 5
The function first initializes an empty list called result.
Then, it loops through the items in the dictionary transl using a for loop.
For each item, it checks if the value is divisible by the input number using the modulo operator (%).
If the value is divisible by the input number, the key is added to the result list.
Finally, the function returns the result list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 2, we need to check if any of the values in the dictionary transl are divisible by 2.
The only value that is divisible by 2 is 2, which is the value associated with the key 'B'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 2 is ['B'].
<<<Output>>>
['B']
