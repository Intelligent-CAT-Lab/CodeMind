The function f takes a dictionary aDict as input and returns a new dictionary where the keys and values of the original dictionary are transposed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {1:1, 2:2, 3:3}, we need to transpose the keys and values of the dictionary.
The keys of the original dictionary are 1, 2, and 3, and the corresponding values are 1, 2, and 3.
The transposed keys and values of the new dictionary are {1:2, 2:3, 3:1}.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {1:1, 2:2, 3:3} is {1:2, 2:3, 3:1}.
<<<Output>>>
{1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 1}
