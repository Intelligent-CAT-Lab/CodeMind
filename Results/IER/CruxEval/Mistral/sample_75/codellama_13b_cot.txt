<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an array and an element. It uses the index() method to find the index of the given element in the array. It then calculates the return value by multiplying the index by 2 and adding the value of the last element in the array (which is at index -ind-1) multiplied by 3.
To determine the return value of executing the function f on the input array [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2] and the element 2, we first find the index of 2 in the array using the index() method. The index of 2 in the array is 2.
Then we calculate the return value by multiplying 2 (the index) by 2 and adding the value of the last element in the array (which is 2) multiplied by 3.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input array [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2] and the element 2 is 10.
