<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string with the characters "---" inserted between every third character of the input string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "scala", we need to insert "---" between every third character of "scala".
The resulting string is "---sca---".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "scala" is "---sca---".
<<<Output>>>
'---sca---'
