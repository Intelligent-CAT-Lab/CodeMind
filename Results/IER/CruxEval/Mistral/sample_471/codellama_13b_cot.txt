<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a string val and a string text. It returns the index of the first occurrence of the character val in the string text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'o' and 'fnmart', we need to find the index of the character 'o' in the string 'fnmart'.
The character 'o' appears at index 2 in the string 'fnmart'.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the inputs 'o' and 'fnmart' is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
