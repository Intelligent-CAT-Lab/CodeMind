<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments, num1, num2, and num3, which are integers.
The function creates a list nums with the three arguments.
The function then sorts the list nums in ascending order using the sort() method.
Finally, the function returns a string formatted as "{nums[0]},{nums[1]},{nums[2]}".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (6,8,8), we first create a list with the three arguments.
Then we sort the list in ascending order.
Finally, we return a string formatted as "{6},{8},{8}".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (6,8,8) is "6,8,8".
<<<Output>>>
'6,8,8'
