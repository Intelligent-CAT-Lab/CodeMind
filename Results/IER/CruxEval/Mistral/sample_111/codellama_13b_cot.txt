The function f takes a dictionary marks as input and returns the highest and lowest marks in the dictionary.
To determine the highest and lowest marks in the given dictionary, we need to iterate through the values of the dictionary and compare them with the current highest and lowest marks.
The highest mark is initially set to 0 and the lowest mark is initially set to 100.
For each value in the dictionary, we check if it is greater than the current highest mark. If it is, we update the highest mark to the new value.
Similarly, we check if the value is less than the current lowest mark. If it is, we update the lowest mark to the new value.
After iterating through all the values in the dictionary, we return the highest and lowest marks.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input dictionary { 'x': 67, 'v': 89, '': 4, 'alij': 11, 'kgfsd': 72, 'yafby': 83 } is (89, 4).
<<<Output>>>
(89, 4)
