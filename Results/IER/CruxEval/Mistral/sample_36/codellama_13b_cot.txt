<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and chars.
The function first checks if the text is empty. If it is empty, it returns the text. Otherwise, it uses the rstrip() method to remove all occurrences of the chars from the end of the text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ha' and an empty string '', we need to check if the input text is empty. Since it is not empty, we use the rstrip() method to remove all occurrences of the empty string '' from the end of the text.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ha' and an empty string '' is 'ha'.
<<<Output>>>
'ha'
