<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string st as input and returns the string st with a leading space if the first character of st is not a tilde (~). If the first character of st is a tilde (~), the function calls itself recursively with the string obtained by right-justifying st with 10 spaces and a newline character (n) using the rjust method.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "eqe-;ew22", we need to check if the first character of the string is a tilde (~). Since it is not, the function returns the string "eqe-;ew22" with a leading space.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "eqe-;ew22" is " eqe-;ew22 ".
<<<Output>>>
' eqe-;ew22 '
