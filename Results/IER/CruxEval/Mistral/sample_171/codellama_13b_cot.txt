<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function first calculates the length of the list nums and divides it by 2 to get the middle index of the list.
Then, the function uses a for loop to iterate through the list nums and pop the first element of the list at each iteration.
This effectively removes the first half of the list from the original list nums.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list [3, 4, 1, 2, 3] is [4, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 2]
