<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string input_string as input and returns a new string with all occurrences of 'a' or 'A' replaced with 'i' or 'I', respectively.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "biec", we need to replace all occurrences of 'a' or 'A' with 'i' or 'I', respectively.
The string "biec" contains two occurrences of 'a', so we need to replace them with 'i'.
The string "biec" also contains one occurrence of 'e', so we need to replace it with 'i'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "biec" is "biei".
<<<Output>>>
'biei'
