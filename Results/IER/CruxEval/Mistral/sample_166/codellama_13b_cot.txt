The function f takes a dictionary graph as input and returns a new dictionary with the same keys as the input dictionary.
For each key in the input dictionary, a new dictionary is created in the output dictionary with the same key.
For each subkey in the value of each key in the input dictionary, an empty string is added to the output dictionary.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input dictionary {} is a new dictionary with the same keys as the input dictionary and empty values for each subkey.
