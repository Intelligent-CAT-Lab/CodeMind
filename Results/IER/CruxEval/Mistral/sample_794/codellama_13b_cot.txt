<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string line as input and returns a string that contains only the alphanumeric characters in line.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'", we need to iterate through each character in the input string and check if it is alphanumeric.
If the character is alphanumeric, we append it to a list a.
Finally, we join the list a using the join() method and return the resulting string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42" is "qwet42".
<<<Output>>>
'qwet42'
