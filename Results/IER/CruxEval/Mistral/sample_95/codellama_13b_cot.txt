<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary zoo as input and returns a new dictionary where the keys and values of the original dictionary are swapped.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'AAA': 'fr'}, we need to swap the keys and values of the dictionary.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'AAA': 'fr'} is {'fr': 'AAA'}.
<<<Output>>>
{'fr': 'AAA'}
