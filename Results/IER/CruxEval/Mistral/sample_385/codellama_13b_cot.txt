<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and returns a new list containing the first three elements of the list lst that are not repeated in the next three elements of the list lst.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 2, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 0], we need to check if each element in the list is repeated in the next three elements.
We start by initializing two empty lists, new\_list and temp\_list.
We then loop through the list lst and check if the current element is in the next three elements of the list.
If it is, we append it to new\_list.
We also check if the length of new\_list is 3.
If it is, we return new\_list.
If not, we continue looping through the list.
After the loop completes, we return new\_list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 2, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 0] is [0, 2, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 2, 1]
