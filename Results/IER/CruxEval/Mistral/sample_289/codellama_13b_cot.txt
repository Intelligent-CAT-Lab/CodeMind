<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string code as input and returns a string in the format "{}: {}".
The first {} in the format string is replaced with the value of the code input variable.
The second {} in the format string is replaced with the encoded value of the code input variable.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "148", we need to encode the string "148" and then replace the {} placeholders in the format string with the encoded value.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "148" is "148: b'148'".
<<<Output>>>
'148: b'148'
