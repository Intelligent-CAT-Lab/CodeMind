<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string sentence as input and returns a new string with all the uppercase letters removed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "XYZ LittleRedRidingHood LiTTleBIGGeXEiT fault", we first convert the sentence to a list of characters using the list() function.
Then, we iterate through each character in the list and check if it is a title case letter using the istitle() method.
If the character is not a title case letter, we remove it from the list using the remove() method.
Finally, we join the remaining characters in the list back into a string using the join() method.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "XYZ LittleRedRidingHood LiTTleBIGGeXEiT fault" is "xyz littleredridinghood littlebiggexeit fault".
<<<Output>>>
'xyz littleredridinghood littlebiggexeit fault'
