<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns True if there are no spaces in the string, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "     i", we need to check if there are any spaces in the string.
Since there are four spaces at the beginning of the string, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
