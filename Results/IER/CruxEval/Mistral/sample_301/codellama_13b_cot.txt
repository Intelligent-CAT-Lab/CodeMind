<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function first calculates the length of the list nums using the len() function and stores it in a variable called count.
Then, the function uses a for loop to iterate over the range of -count+1 to 0.
Inside the loop, the function uses the extend() method to add two copies of the current element of nums to the end of the list.
Finally, the function returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, 2, -1, -2], we need to apply the function to the input list.
The output of the function f on the input [0, 6, 2, -1, -2] is [0, 6, 2, -1, -2, -1, -2].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 6, 2, -1, -2, -1, -2]
