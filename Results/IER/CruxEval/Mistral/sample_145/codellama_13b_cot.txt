<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: price and product. It first checks if the product is in the inventory. If it is not, the function returns the price. If it is, the price is multiplied by 0.85 and the product is removed from the inventory.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (8.50, 'grapes'), we first check if 'grapes' is in the inventory. Since it is not, the function returns 8.50.
<<<Output>>>
8.5
