<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string t as input and returns the concatenation of the two parts of the string separated by the '-' character.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "fubarbaz", we need to split the string at the '-' character and store the two parts in variables a and b.
The length of the string b is 3, which is the same as the length of the string a.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "fubarbaz" is "fubarbaz".
<<<Output>>>
'fubarbaz'
