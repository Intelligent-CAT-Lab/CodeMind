<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and sub. It initializes two variables, a and b, to 0 and the length of the text minus 1, respectively. It then enters a while loop that continues until a is greater than b.
Inside the loop, the function calculates the middle index c by taking the average of a and b. It then checks if the substring sub is present in the text starting from index c. If it is, the function sets a to c + 1. Otherwise, it sets b to c - 1.
After the loop, the function returns the value of a.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'dorfunctions' and '2', we need to find the index of the substring '2' in the text 'dorfunctions'.
The substring '2' is not present in the text 'dorfunctions', so the function will not find it in the text starting from index c. Therefore, the function will set b to c - 1 in each iteration of the loop until a is greater than b.
Since the length of the text is 11, the maximum value of a is 11. Therefore, the function will set b to 10 in the first iteration of the loop, and then set a to 11 in the second iteration of the loop.
The function will then return the value of a, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
