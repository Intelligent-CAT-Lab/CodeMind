<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string with all occurrences of the character '+' removed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hbtofdeiequ", we first convert the input string to a list using the list() function.
Then, we iterate over each character in the string '+', and for each occurrence of the character '+' in the list, we remove it using the remove() method.
Finally, we join the resulting list back into a string using the join() method.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hbtofdeiequ" is "hbtofdeie".
<<<Output>>>
'hbtofdeie'
