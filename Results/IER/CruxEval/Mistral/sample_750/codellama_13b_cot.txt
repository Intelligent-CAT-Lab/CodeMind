The function f takes two arguments: a dictionary char_map and a string text. It initializes an empty string new_text. It then iterates over each character in the text. For each character, it checks if the character is in the char_map. If the character is not in the char_map, it adds the character to new_text. If the character is in the char_map, it adds the value associated with that character to new_text. Finally, it returns new_text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ({}, 'hbd'), we need to iterate over each character in the string 'hbd'. For the first character 'h', we check if it is in the char_map. Since it is not in the char_map, we add it to new_text. For the second character 'b', we check if it is in the char_map. Since it is not in the char_map, we add it to new_text. For the third character 'd', we check if it is in the char_map. Since it is not in the char_map, we add it to new_text. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ({}, 'hbd') is 'hbd'.

'hbd'
