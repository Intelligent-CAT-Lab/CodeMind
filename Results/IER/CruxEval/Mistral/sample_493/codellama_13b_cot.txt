<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns a list of strings.
For each key-value pair in the dictionary d, the function appends a string in the format "%s => %s" to the list keys, where s is the key and d[s] is the value.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {-4: '4', '1': '2', '-': '-3'} is a list of strings:
['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3']
<<<Output>>>
['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3']
