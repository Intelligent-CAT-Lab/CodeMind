<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a list of substrings of the input string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "123", we need to split the input string into substrings of length 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "123" is a list containing the substrings "1", "2", and "3".
<<<Output>>>
['1', '2', '3']
