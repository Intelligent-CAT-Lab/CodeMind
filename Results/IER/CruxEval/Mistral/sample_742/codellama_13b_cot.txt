<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a boolean value.
The boolean value is True if all characters in the string are digits, otherwise False.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "-1-3", we need to check if all characters in the string are digits.
The string "-1-3" contains two non-digit characters '-' and '-'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "-1-3" is False.
<<<Output>>>
False
