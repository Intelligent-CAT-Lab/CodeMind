The function f takes two inputs: a string forest and an animal. It first finds the index of the animal in the forest using the index() method. It then creates a new list by converting the forest string to a list using the list() function.
It then enters a while loop that iterates from the index of the animal to the end of the forest string. In each iteration, it assigns the element at index+1 to the current element in the result list.
After the loop, it checks if the index is equal to the length of the forest string minus one. If it is, it assigns '-' to the last element in the result list.
Finally, it returns the concatenation of all the elements in the result list using the join() method.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '2imo 12 tfiqr.' and 'm', we first find the index of 'm' in the forest string using the index() method. The index of 'm' is 4.
Then, we create a new list by converting the forest string to a list using the list() function. The resulting list is ['2imo', '12', 'tfiqr.'].
The while loop iterates from index 4 to the end of the forest string. In each iteration, it assigns the element at index+1 to the current element in the result list. The resulting list after the loop is ['2imo', '12', '-', 'tfiqr.'].
Since the index is equal to the length of the forest string minus one, '-' is assigned to the last element in the result list.
Finally, the join() method is used to concatenate all the elements in the result list, resulting in the output '2imo12-tfiqr.'.
<<<Output>>>
'2imo12-tfiqr.'
