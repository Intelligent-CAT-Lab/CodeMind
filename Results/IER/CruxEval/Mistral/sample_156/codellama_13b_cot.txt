<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: text, limit, and char.
The function first checks if the length of the text is less than the limit. If it is, the function returns the first limit characters of the text.
If the length of the text is greater than or equal to the limit, the function uses the ljust method to pad the text with the character specified by char to reach the limit.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'tqzym', 5, 'c', we first check if the length of the text is less than 5. Since it is not, we use the ljust method to pad the text with the character 'c' to reach the limit of 5.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'tqzym', 5, 'c' is 'tqzymc'.
<<<Output>>>
'tqzymc'
