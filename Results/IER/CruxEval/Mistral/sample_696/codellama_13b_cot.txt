The function f takes a string text as input and returns the sum of the lengths of all substrings of text that are repeated in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "wdj", we need to find all substrings of "wdj" that are repeated in the string and calculate the sum of their lengths.
The substrings of "wdj" that are repeated in "wdj" are "d" and "j".
The length of "d" is 1 and the length of "j" is 1.
Therefore, the sum of the lengths of these substrings is 1 + 1 = 2.
The return value of the function f on the input "wdj" is 2.
