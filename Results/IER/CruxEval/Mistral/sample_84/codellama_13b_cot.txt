<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string with the words in the input string capitalized.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "nwv mef ofme bdryl", we need to split the input string into a list of words, capitalize each word, and then join the list of words back into a string.
The list of words after splitting the input string is ['nwv', 'mef', 'ofme', 'bdryl'].
The capitalized version of each word is ['NWV', 'MEF', 'OFME', 'BDARYL'].
The resulting string after joining the list of capitalized words is 'NWV MEF OFME BDARYL'.
<<<Output>>>
'NWV MEF OFME BDARYL'
