<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of floats.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input range(100, 120), we need to convert each number in the range to a float by dividing it by 1.
The resulting list of floats is [100.0, 101.0, 102.0, 103.0, 104.0, 105.0, 106.0, 107.0, 108.0, 109.0, 110.0, 111.0, 112.0].
Since 1 is not in the list of floats, the function returns an empty list.
