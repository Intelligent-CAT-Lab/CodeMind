The function f takes two arguments: a dictionary data and an integer num. It creates a new empty dictionary new\_dict and iterates over the items of the dictionary data in reverse order, starting from the second to last item and ending at the item before the num. For each item, it adds it to the new\_dict with a value of None. Finally, it returns the items of the dictionary data starting from the num and concatenates them with the items of the new\_dict.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1} and num=1, we need to iterate over the items of the dictionary data in reverse order, starting from the second to last item and ending at the item before the num. The items of the dictionary data are {1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1}. The item before the num is 2. Therefore, the items to be added to the new\_dict are {2: None, 3: None}. The items of the dictionary data starting from the num are {1: 9}. Concatenating these two lists gives us [(1, 9), (2, None), (3, None)].
<<<Output>>>
[(1, 9), (2, None), (3, None)]
