The function f takes two arguments: text and delim.
The function returns the substring of text that is the reverse of the substring of text that starts with the delimiter delim and ends with the delimiter delim.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'dsj osq wi w' and the delimiter ' ', we need to find the substring of 'dsj osq wi w' that starts with ' ' and ends with ' '.
The substring of 'dsj osq wi w' that starts with ' ' and ends with ' ' is 'osq wi w'.
The reverse of this substring is 'wiruosq'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'dsj osq wi w' and the delimiter ' ' is 'wiruosq'.
<<<Output>>>
'wiruosq'
