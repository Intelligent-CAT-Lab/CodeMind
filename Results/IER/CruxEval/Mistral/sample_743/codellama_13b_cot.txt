The function f takes a string as input and splits it into two strings using the comma as the delimiter. It then returns the negative of the sum of the lengths of the two strings.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "dog,cat", we need to split the input string into two strings using the comma as the delimiter. The resulting two strings are "dog" and "cat".
The length of "dog" is 3 and the length of "cat" is 3.
Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two strings is 3 + 3 = 6.
The negative of 6 is -6.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input "dog,cat" is -6.
<<<Output>>>
-6
