<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary dct as input and returns a new dictionary with the same keys as the input dictionary.
For each key-value pair in the input dictionary, the function splits the value string by the dot character, takes the first item in the resulting list, and appends "@pinc.uk" to it.
The resulting string is then used as the value for the corresponding key in the output dictionary.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on an empty dictionary {} is an empty dictionary.
