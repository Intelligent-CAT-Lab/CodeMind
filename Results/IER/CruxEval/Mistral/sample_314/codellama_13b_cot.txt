The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string with the following format:
- If the string contains a comma, the function splits the string into three parts using the partition method. The first part is the text before the comma, the second part is the comma itself, and the third part is the text after the comma. The function then returns the text after the comma followed by a space and the text before the comma.
- If the string does not contain a comma, the function splits the string into two parts using the partition method. The first part is the text before the space, and the second part is the text after the space. The function then returns the text after the space followed by a space and the text before the space, and appends " 0" to the end of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "244, 105, -90", we need to split the string into three parts using the partition method. The first part is "244", the second part is the comma itself, and the third part is "-90". The function then returns "-90 244".
<<<Output>>>
'-90 244'
