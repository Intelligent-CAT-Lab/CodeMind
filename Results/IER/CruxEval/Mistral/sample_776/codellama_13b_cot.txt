The function f takes a dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary.
The function first creates a copy of the input dictionary using the `copy()` method.
Then, it iterates over the keys of the copy of the dictionary using a for loop.
For each key, it checks if the key is odd by using the modulo operator `%`.
If the key is odd, it deletes the key from the copy of the dictionary using the `del` keyword.
Then, it adds a new key to the copy of the dictionary with the value of the deleted key and a prefix "$".
Finally, the function returns the copy of the dictionary with the added and deleted keys.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `{}`, we need to create an empty dictionary and apply the function to it.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `{}` is an empty dictionary.
