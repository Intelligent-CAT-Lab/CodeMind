<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list as input and returns a new list.
The function first calculates the length of the input list using the len() function.
Then, it initializes an empty list called new\_list.
The function then uses a for loop to iterate over the items in the input list.
In each iteration, the function appends the current item from the input list to the new\_list using the append() method.
After the loop, the function pops the last item from the input list using the pop() method and appends it to the new\_list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list [5, 8, 6, 8, 4] is [5, 8, 6, 8, 4, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 8, 6, 8, 4, 4]
