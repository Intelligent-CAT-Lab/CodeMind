<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a list of integers nums and an integer val. It creates a new list new\_list and iterates over each element in nums. For each element, it extends new\_list by adding val copies of that element. Finally, it returns the sum of all elements in new\_list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [10, 4] and val 3, we first create a new list new\_list. Then, we iterate over each element in [10, 4]. For each element, we extend new\_list by adding 3 copies of that element. Finally, we return the sum of all elements in new\_list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [10, 4] and val 3 is 35.
