The function f takes an integer n as input and converts it to a string using the built-in function str().
Then, it extracts the first character of the string using indexing and adds a dot to it.
Next, it replaces all occurrences of the string "-" with the string "_" using the replace() method.
Finally, it returns the modified string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "first-second-third", we first convert it to a string using the built-in function str().
Then, we extract the first character of the string using indexing and add a dot to it.
Next, we replace all occurrences of the string "-" with the string "_" using the replace() method.
Finally, we return the modified string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "first-second-third" is "f.s_th".
<<<Output>>>
'f.s_th'
