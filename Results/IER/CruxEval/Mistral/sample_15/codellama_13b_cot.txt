<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: text, wrong, and right.
The function replaces all occurrences of the string wrong with the string right in the text.
Then, the function converts the resulting string to uppercase using the upper() method.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "zn kgd jw lnt", we need to replace "h" with "u" in the string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "zn kgd jw lnt" is "ZN KGD JW LNT".
<<<Output>>>
'ZN KGD JW LNT'
