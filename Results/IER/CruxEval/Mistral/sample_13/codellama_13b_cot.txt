<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of names as input and returns the number of names in the list that are alphabets.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list ['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee'], we need to count the number of names in the list that are alphabets.
There are two names in the list that are alphabets: 'sharron' and 'Savannah'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list ['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee'] is 2.
<<<Output>>>
