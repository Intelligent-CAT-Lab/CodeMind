The function f takes a list of years as input and calculates the number of years before 1900 and after 1910. It then checks which of these two values is greater than 3 and returns 3, 1, or 2 accordingly.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1872, 1995, 1945], we first calculate the number of years before 1900 and after 1910.
The number of years before 1900 is 123 (1872 + 1945 + 1995 - 1900).
The number of years after 1910 is 85 (1995 - 1910).
Since both of these values are less than or equal to 3, the function returns 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
