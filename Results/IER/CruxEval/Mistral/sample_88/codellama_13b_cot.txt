<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two string inputs, s1 and s2. It checks if s2 ends with s1. If it does, it removes the last occurrence of s1 from s2.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs "he" and "hello", we need to check if "hello" ends with "he". Since it does, we remove the last occurrence of "he" from "hello".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs "he" and "hello" is "hell".
<<<Output>>>
'hell'
