The function f takes two arguments: text and char.
The function checks if the text ends with the char.
If the text does not end with the char, the function calls itself recursively with the char concatenated to the text and the same char as the argument.
If the text ends with the char, the function returns the text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'staovk' and 'k', we need to check if the text 'staovk' ends with the char 'k'.
Since the text does not end with the char 'k', the function calls itself recursively with the char 'k' concatenated to the text 'staovk' and the same char 'k' as the argument.
The recursive call will continue until the text ends with the char 'k'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'staovk' and 'k' is 'staovk'.
<<<Output>>>
'staovk'
