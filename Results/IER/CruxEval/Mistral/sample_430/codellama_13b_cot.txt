<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two lists as input, arr1 and arr2. It creates a new list called new\_arr by copying the elements of arr1. Then, it extends new\_arr by appending all the elements of arr2. Finally, it returns new\_arr.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input lists [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] and ['', 0, -1, []], we first create a new list called new\_arr by copying the elements of [5, 1, 3, 7, 8]. Then, we extend new\_arr by appending all the elements of ['', 0, -1, []]. The resulting list is [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []].
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input lists [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] and ['', 0, -1, []] is [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]
