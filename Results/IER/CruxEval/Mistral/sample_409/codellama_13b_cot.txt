<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and char.
The function first checks if the text is not empty. If it is not empty, it removes the first occurrence of the character char from the text using the removeprefix() method.
Then, it removes the last occurrence of the character char from the text using the removeprefix() method again.
After that, it removes the last character from the text using the slice notation.
Finally, it capitalizes the last character of the text using the capitalize() method and concatenates it with the rest of the text.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'querist' and 'u' is 'Querist'.
<<<Output>>>
'Querist'
