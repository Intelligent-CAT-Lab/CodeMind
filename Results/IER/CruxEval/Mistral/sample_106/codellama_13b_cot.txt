<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function first calculates the length of the list using the len() function and stores it in a variable called count.
Then, the function uses a for loop to iterate over each element in the list starting from index 0 to count-1.
Inside the loop, the function multiplies the current element of the list by 2 and inserts it at the current index using the insert() method.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list [2, 8, -2, 9, 3, 3] is [4, 16, 4, 18, 6, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 16, 4, 18, 6, 6]
