<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a list of integers nums, an integer idx, and an integer added.
The function modifies the list nums by inserting the integer added at the index idx.
The modified list nums is returned by the function.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, 3, we need to insert the integer 3 at index 2 in the list [2, 2, 2, 3, 3].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, 3, is [2, 2, 3, 3, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
