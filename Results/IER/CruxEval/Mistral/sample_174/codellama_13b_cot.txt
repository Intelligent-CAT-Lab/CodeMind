The function f takes a list lst as input and modifies it in place. Specifically, it reverses the sublist lst[1:4] (i.e., the sublist starting at index 1 and ending at index 3) using slicing notation.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to reverse the sublist [2, 3] (i.e., the sublist starting at index 1 and ending at index 3).
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 3, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 2]
