<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a dictionary d and a list l. It creates a new dictionary new\_d and iterates over the elements in the list l. For each element k in l, it checks if k exists in the dictionary d. If it does, it adds k and its corresponding value from d to the new dictionary new\_d. Finally, it returns a copy of the new dictionary new\_d.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {{"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}, ["lorem ipsum", "dolor"]}, we need to create a new dictionary new\_d and iterate over the elements in the list ["lorem ipsum", "dolor"]. For each element k in the list, we check if k exists in the dictionary d. Since "lorem ipsum" exists in the dictionary d with the value 12, we add it to the new dictionary new\_d with the same value. Similarly, since "dolor" exists in the dictionary d with the value 23, we add it to the new dictionary new\_d with the same value. Finally, we return a copy of the new dictionary new\_d, which is {{"lorem ipsum": 12, "dolor": 23}}.
<<<Output>>>
{{"lorem ipsum": 12, "dolor": 23}}
