<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and iterates through each element in the list using a for loop.
For each element in the list, the function checks if the index of the element is even using the modulo operator (%).
If the index is even, the function multiplies the current element with the next element in the list and appends the result to the list using the append() method.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on an empty list [] is an empty list.
<<<Output>>>
[]
