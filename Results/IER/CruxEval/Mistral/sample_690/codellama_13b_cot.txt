<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer n as input and returns a string.
If the integer n has a decimal point, the function returns the string representation of the integer n plus 2.5.
Otherwise, the function returns the string representation of the integer n.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '800', we need to check if the integer 800 has a decimal point.
Since 800 is an integer and does not have a decimal point, the function returns the string representation of the integer 800, which is '800'.
<<<Output>>>
'800'
