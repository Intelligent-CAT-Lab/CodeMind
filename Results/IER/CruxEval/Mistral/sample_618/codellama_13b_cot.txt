<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: match, fill, and n.
The function returns the concatenation of the first n characters of the string fill with the string match.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('9', '8', 2), we need to concatenate the first 2 characters of the string '8' with the string '9'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('9', '8', 2) is '89'.
<<<Output>>>
'89'
