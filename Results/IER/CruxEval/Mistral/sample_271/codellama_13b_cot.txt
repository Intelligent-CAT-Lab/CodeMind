<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and c.
It first converts the text to a list using the list() function.
Then it checks if the character c is present in the text using the rindex() method.
If the character c is not present in the text, it raises a ValueError with the message "Text has no {c}".
If the character c is present in the text, it removes the last occurrence of the character c from the list using the pop() method.
Finally, it joins the remaining elements of the list using the join() method and returns the resulting string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'uufhl' and 'l', we first convert 'uufhl' to a list using the list() function.
Then we check if the character 'l' is present in the list using the rindex() method.
Since the character 'l' is present in the list, it removes the last occurrence of the character 'l' from the list using the pop() method.
Finally, it joins the remaining elements of the list using the join() method and returns the resulting string 'uufh'.
<<<Output>>>
'uufh'
