The function f takes a dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary.
The new dictionary is created by copying the original dictionary using the `dict.copy()` method.
Then, the function iterates over the items in the original dictionary using a for loop.
For each item, if the value is also a key in the dictionary, the key is removed from the new dictionary using the `del` keyword.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `{ -1: -1, 5: 5, 3: 6, -4: -4 }` is a new dictionary with the keys `-1`, `5`, `3`, and `-4` removed.
The resulting dictionary is `{ 4: -4 }`.
<<<Output>>>
{ 4: -4 }
