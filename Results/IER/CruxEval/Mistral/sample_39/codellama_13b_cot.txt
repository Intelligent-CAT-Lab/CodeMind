<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an array and an element. It checks if the element is present in the array using the in keyword. If the element is present, it returns the index of the element using the index() method of the array. If the element is not present, it returns -1.
To determine the return value of executing the function f on the input array [6, 2, 7, 1] and the element 6, we need to check if 6 is present in the array. Since 6 is present in the array at index 0, the function returns 0.
