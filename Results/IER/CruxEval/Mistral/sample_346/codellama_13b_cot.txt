The function f takes a string filename as input and returns a new string.
The first step is to split the filename by the dot character to get a list of the suffixes.
The last suffix in the list is then reversed and concatenated to the original filename using the slice notation.
The resulting string is then checked to see if it ends with the last suffix using the endswith() method.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "docs.doc", we first split the filename by the dot character to get the suffix "doc".
Then we reverse the suffix to get "ocod" and concatenate it to the original filename "docs" using the slice notation.
The resulting string is "docsocod".
The endswith() method is then called on this string to check if it ends with the suffix "doc".
Since "doc" is not at the end of the string, the function returns False.

False
