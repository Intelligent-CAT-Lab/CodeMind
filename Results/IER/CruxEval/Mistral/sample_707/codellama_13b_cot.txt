<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and position.
The function first calculates the length of the text and the index of the position.
If the position is less than 0 or the index is less than 0, the index is set to -1.
The function then creates a new list from the text and removes the element at the index.
Finally, the function returns the concatenation of the remaining elements in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'undbs l' and position 1, we first calculate the length of the text as 6 and the index of the position as 1.
Since the position is less than 0, the index is set to -1.
The function then creates a new list from the text and removes the element at index -1.
The resulting list is ['u', 'd', 'b', 's'].
Finally, the function returns the concatenation of the remaining elements in the list, which is 'udbs'.
<<<Output>>>
'udbs'
