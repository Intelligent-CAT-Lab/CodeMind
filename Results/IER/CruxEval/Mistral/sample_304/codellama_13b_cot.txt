<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns a new dictionary with the values of the two largest keys in the original dictionary.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {2: 3, 17: 3, 16: 6, 18: 6, 87: 7}, we need to find the two largest keys in the dictionary and remove them.
The two largest keys in the dictionary are 18 and 87, with values 6 and 7 respectively.
The function then returns a new dictionary with these two keys and their corresponding values.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {2: 3, 17: 3, 16: 6, 18: 6, 87: 7} is {18: 6, 87: 7}.
<<<Output>>>
{18: 6, 87: 7}
