<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a list of integers nums, an integer start, and an integer k.
The function first reverses the sublist of nums starting from start and with length k using the slice notation [start:start+k][::-1].
Then, it replaces the sublist of nums starting from start and with length k with the reversed sublist.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4, 2 is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5]
