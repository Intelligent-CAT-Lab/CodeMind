The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function uses a for loop to iterate over the list nums.
Inside the loop, the function checks if the length of the list nums is 0. If it is, the loop breaks.
If the length of the list nums is even, the function removes the last element of the list using the pop() method.
If the length of the list nums is odd, the function removes the first element of the list using the pop(0) method.
The function then increments the count variable by 1.
After the loop completes, the function returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 3], we need to apply the logic of the function to the input list.
The first element of the list is 3, which is odd, so the function removes the first element of the list using pop(0).
The modified list becomes [2, 0, 0, 2, 3].
The length of the list is even, so the function removes the last element of the list using pop().
The modified list becomes [2, 0, 0, 2].
The length of the list is even, so the function removes the last element of the list using pop().
The modified list becomes [2, 0, 2].
The length of the list is even, so the function removes the last element of the list using pop().
The modified list becomes [2, 2].
The length of the list is even, so the function removes the last element of the list using pop().
The modified list becomes [2].
The length of the list is odd, so the function removes the first element of the list using pop(0).
The modified list becomes [].
The function returns an empty list.
