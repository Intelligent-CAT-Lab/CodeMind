The function f takes a list array as input and returns a new list.
The function first applies a lambda function to each element of the input list array. The lambda function multiplies each element by the string "n".
The resulting list of strings is then stored in a variable called just_ns.
The function then iterates over each element in just_ns and appends it to a new list called final_output.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on an empty list [] is an empty list.
