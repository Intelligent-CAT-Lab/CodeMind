The function f takes a string text as input and returns a substring of text starting from the index of the first non-space character and ending at the index of the next non-space character plus 4.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "-----\t\n\tth\n-----", we need to find the index of the first non-space character and the index of the next non-space character plus 4.
The first non-space character in the input is "t" at index 2.
The next non-space character is "h" at index 4.
Therefore, the substring of text starting from index 2 and ending at index 7 plus 4 is "th".
The output of executing the function f on the input "-----\t\n\tth\n-----" is "th".
<<<Output>>>
'th'
