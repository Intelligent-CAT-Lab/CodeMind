<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: an array, an index ind, and an element elem.
The function inserts the element elem at the index ind of the array.
If ind is less than 0, the element is inserted at the end of the array.
If ind is greater than the length of the array, the element is inserted at the end of the array.
If ind is equal to the length of the array, the element is inserted at the end of the array.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3], 2, 7 is [1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3, 7].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3, 7]
