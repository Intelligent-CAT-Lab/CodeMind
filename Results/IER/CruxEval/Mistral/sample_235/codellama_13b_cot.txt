The function f takes two inputs: array and arr. It initializes an empty list called result. It then iterates over each element in the array and applies a filter function to each element. The filter function takes a lambda function as input and returns a list of elements that do not contain any empty strings. The resulting list of non-empty strings is then appended to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs [[]] and [[]], we need to apply the filter function to each element in the array. Since both arrays are empty, the filter function will return an empty list for each element. Therefore, the resulting list of non-empty strings will also be empty.
