<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string. It initializes an empty string result. Then, it iterates through each character in the input string text. For each character, it checks if the character is an alphanumeric character using the isalnum() method. If the character is an alphanumeric character, it converts the character to uppercase using the upper() method and appends it to the result string using the += operator. Finally, the function returns the result string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "—Å bishop.Swift", we need to iterate through each character in the input string and check if it is an alphanumeric character. If it is an alphanumeric character, we convert it to uppercase and append it to the result string. The resulting string is "SBISHOPSWIFT".
<<<Output>>>
'SBISHOPSWIFT'
