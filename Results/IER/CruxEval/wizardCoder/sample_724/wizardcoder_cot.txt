Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, function):
    cites = [len(text[text.index(function) + len(function):])]
    for char in text:
        if char == function:
            cites.append(len(text[text.index(function) + len(function):]))
    return cites
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("010100", "010")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, text and function.
The function first finds the index of the function in the text using the index() method.
The function then creates a list called cites and appends the length of the text starting from the index of the function plus the length of the function.
The function then iterates through the text and checks if each character is equal to the function.
If the character is equal to the function, the function appends the length of the text starting from the index of the function plus the length of the function to the cites list.
Finally, the function returns the cites list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "010100" and "010", we need to find the index of "010" in "010100" using the index() method.
The index of "010" in "010100" is 2.
Therefore, the length of the text starting from the index of "010" plus the length of "010" is 4.
Therefore, the cites list is [4].

The return value of the code is [4].
