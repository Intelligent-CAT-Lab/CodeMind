Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string, code):
    t = ''
    try:
        t = string.encode(code)
        if t.endswith(b'\n'):
            t = t[:-1]
        t = t.decode('UTF-8')
        return t
    except:
        return t
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("towaru", "UTF-8")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, string and code.
The first line initializes an empty string t.
The second line tries to encode the string using the specified code.
If the encoding is successful, the encoded string is stored in t.
If the encoded string ends with a newline character, it is removed from t.
The third line decodes the encoded string from UTF-8 encoding to a Unicode string.
If the decoding is successful, the decoded string is returned.
If the decoding fails, an empty string is returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "towaru" and code "UTF-8", we need to encode the string "towaru" using the specified code.
If the encoding is successful, the encoded string is stored in t.
If the encoded string ends with a newline character, it is removed from t.
The decoded string is then returned.

If the encoding fails, an empty string is returned.

<<<Output>>>
'towaru'
