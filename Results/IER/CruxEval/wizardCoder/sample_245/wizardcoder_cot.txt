Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(alphabet, s):
    a = [x for x in alphabet if x.upper() in s]
    if s.upper() == s:
        a.append('all_uppercased')
    return a
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', "uppercased # % ^ @! vz.")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, alphabet and s.
The alphabet is a string containing all the letters of the alphabet in lowercase.
The s is a string containing a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.

The function creates a list a by iterating over each letter in the alphabet and checking if it is present in the string s.
If the letter is present in the string s, it is added to the list a.

If the string s is all uppercase, the function adds the string 'all_uppercased' to the list a.

Finally, the function returns the list a.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "uppercased # % ^ @! vz.", we need to iterate over each letter in the alphabet and check if it is present in the string s.

The letter 'u' is present in the string s, so it is added to the list a.
The letter 'p' is present in the string s, so it is added to the list a.
The letter 'p' is present in the string s, so it is added to the list a.
The letter 'e' is present in the string s, so it is added to the list a.
The letter 'd' is present in the string s, so it is added to the list a.
The letter 'e' is present in the string s, so it is added to the list a.
The letter 'd' is present in the string s, so it is added to the list a.
The letter'' is present in the string s, so it is added to the list a.
The letter '#' is not present in the string s, so it is not added to the list a.
The letter'' is present in the string s, so it is added to the list a.
The letter '%' is not present in the string s, so it is not added to the list a.
The letter'' is present in the string s, so it is added to the list a.
The letter '^' is not present in the string s, so it is not added to the list a.
The letter'' is present in the string s, so it is added to the list a.
The letter '@' is not present in the string s, so it is not added to the list a
