Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    a = []
    for i in range(len(text)):
        if not text[i].isdecimal():
            a.append(text[i])
    return ''.join(a)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("seiq7229 d27")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string that contains only the non-decimal characters of the input string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "seiq7229 d27", we need to iterate over each character of the input string and append it to a list if it is not a decimal.
Therefore, the list of non-decimal characters in the input string is ['s', 'e', 'i', 'q','', 'd', '2', '7'].
Finally, we join the list of non-decimal characters to form the output string "seiq d7".
<<<Output>>>
'seiq d7'
