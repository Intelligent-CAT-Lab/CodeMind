Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(d, rm):
    res = d.copy()
    for k in rm:
        if k in res:
            del res[k]
    return res
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'1': 'a', 1: 'a', 1: 'b', '1': 'b'}, [1])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a dictionary d and a list of keys rm.
The function creates a copy of the dictionary d and stores it in the variable res.
The function then iterates over the keys in the list rm and checks if each key is in the dictionary res.
If the key is in res, the function deletes the key-value pair from res.
Finally, the function returns the updated dictionary res.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'1': 'a', 1: 'a', 1: 'b', '1': 'b'}, [1], we need to create a copy of the dictionary {'1': 'a', 1: 'a', 1: 'b', '1': 'b'} and remove the key-value pair with key 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'1': 'a', 1: 'a', 1: 'b', '1': 'b'}, [1] is {'1': 'a', '1': 'b'}.
<<<Output>>>
{'1': 'a', '1': 'b'}
