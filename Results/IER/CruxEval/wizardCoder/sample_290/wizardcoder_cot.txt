Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, prefix):
    if text.startswith(prefix):
        return text.removeprefix(prefix)
    if prefix in text:
        return text.replace(prefix, '').strip()
    return text.upper()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('abixaaaily', 'al')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and prefix.
The first if statement checks if the text starts with the prefix. If it does, it removes the prefix from the text using the removeprefix() method.
The second if statement checks if the prefix is in the text. If it is, it replaces the prefix with an empty string and strips any leading or trailing whitespace using the replace() and strip() methods.
The third if statement returns the uppercase version of the text using the upper() method.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "abixaaaily" and prefix "al", we need to check if the text starts with "al". Since it does, we remove the prefix "al" from the text using the removeprefix() method. The resulting text is "bixaaaily".
Since the prefix "al" is not in the text, we need to check if it is in the text. Since it is not, we return the uppercase version of the text using the upper() method.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "abixaaaily" and prefix "al" is "BIXAAAILY".
<<<Output>>>
'BIXAAAILY'
