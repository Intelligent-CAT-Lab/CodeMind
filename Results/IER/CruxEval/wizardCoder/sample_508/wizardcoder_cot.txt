Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, sep, maxsplit):
    splitted = text.rsplit(sep, maxsplit)
    length = len(splitted)
    new_splitted = splitted[:length // 2]
    new_splitted.reverse()
    new_splitted += splitted[length // 2:]
    return sep.join(new_splitted)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ertubwi', 'p', 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, sep, and maxsplit.
The text parameter is a string that we want to split.
The sep parameter is a string that we want to use as a separator to split the text.
The maxsplit parameter is an integer that specifies the maximum number of splits to do.

The function first splits the text using the rsplit method, which splits the text from the right side of the separator.
The rsplit method splits the text from the right side of the separator, and it returns a list of substrings.

The function then calculates the length of the list of substrings.

The function then creates a new list of substrings by taking the first half of the list of substrings.

The function then reverses the order of the substrings in the new list.

The function then appends the second half of the list of substrings to the end of the new list.

Finally, the function joins the substrings in the new list using the sep parameter as a separator, and returns the resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "ertubwi", "p", and 5, we need to split the string "ertubwi" using the separator "p" up to a maximum of 5 splits.

The first half of the resulting list of substrings is "ertu", and the second half is "bwi".

The new list of substrings is "ertu", "bwi", and the order of the substrings is reversed.

The new list of substrings is then joined using the separator "p", resulting in the output "uertbwp".

<<<Output>>>
'uertbwp'
