Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(list):
    for i in range(len(list) - 1, 0, -1):
        for j in range(i):
            if list[j] > list[j + 1]:
                list[j], list[j + 1] = list[j + 1], list[j]
                list.sort()
    return list
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([63, 0, 1, 5, 9, 87, 0, 7, 25, 4])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list as input and sorts it in ascending order.
The function first iterates through the list from the last element to the second element.
For each iteration, the function iterates through the list from the current element to the previous element.
If the current element is greater than the next element, the function swaps the two elements and sorts the list again.
The function returns the sorted list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [63, 0, 1, 5, 9, 87, 0, 7, 25, 4], we need to sort the list [63, 0, 1, 5, 9, 87, 0, 7, 25, 4] in ascending order.

The sorted list is [0, 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 25, 63, 87].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [63, 0, 1, 5, 9, 87, 0, 7, 25, 4] is [0, 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 25, 63, 87].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 25, 63, 87]
