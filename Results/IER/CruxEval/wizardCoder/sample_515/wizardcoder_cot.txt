Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    result = array.copy()
    result.reverse()
    result[:] = [item * 2 for item in result]
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array with the elements of the input array in reverse order, doubled, and then assigned back to the original array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we need to reverse the input array, double each element, and assign the result back to the original array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is [10, 8, 6, 4, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
