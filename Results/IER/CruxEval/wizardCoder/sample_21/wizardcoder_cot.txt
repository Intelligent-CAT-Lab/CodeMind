Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    n = array.pop()
    array.extend([n, n])
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 1, 2, 2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and modifies it in place.
The input array is [1, 1, 2, 2].
The first line of the function pops the last element of the array and assigns it to the variable n.
The second line extends the array with the value of n twice, resulting in [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2].
The function returns the modified array.
The output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 2, 2] is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]
