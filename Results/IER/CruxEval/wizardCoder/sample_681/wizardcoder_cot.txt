Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, ind, elem):
    array.insert(-5 if ind < 0 else len(array) if ind > len(array) else ind + 1, elem)
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3], 2, 7)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array, an index, and an element as input.
The function inserts the element at the specified index in the array.
If the index is less than 0, the function inserts the element at the beginning of the array.
If the index is greater than the length of the array, the function inserts the element at the end of the array.
If the index is between 0 and the length of the array, the function inserts the element at the specified index.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3], 2, 7), we need to insert 7 at index 2 in the array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3], 2, 7) is [1, 5, 7, 8, 2, 0, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 7, 8, 2, 0, 3]
