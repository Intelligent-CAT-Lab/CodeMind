Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    for item in text.split():
        text = text.replace('-{}'.format(item),'').replace('{}-'.format(item),'')
    return text.strip('-')
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following operations:
1. Split the input string into a list of words using the split() method.
2. Iterate over each word in the list and replace any occurrence of the word with a space using the replace() method.
3. Replace any occurrence of a hyphen followed by the word with a space using the replace() method.
4. Replace any occurrence of the word followed by a hyphen with a space using the replace() method.
5. Strip any leading or trailing hyphens from the resulting string using the strip() method.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-", we need to perform the following operations:
1. Split the input string into a list of words: ['stew', '---', 'corn', 'and', 'beans', 'in','soup', '.']
2. Iterate over each word in the list and replace any occurrence of the word with a space: ['stew','','', 'corn', 'and', 'beans', 'in','soup', '.']
3. Replace any occurrence of a hyphen followed by the word with a space: ['stew','','', 'corn', 'and', 'beans', 'in','soup', '.']
4. Replace any occurrence of the word followed by a hyphen with a space: ['stew','','', 'corn', 'and', 'beans', 'in','soup', '.']
5. Strip any leading or trailing hyphens from the resulting string:'stew corn and beans in soup'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-" is "stew corn and beans in soup".
<<<Output>>>
'stew corn and beans in soup'
