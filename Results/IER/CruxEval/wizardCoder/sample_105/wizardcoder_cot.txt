Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    if not text.istitle():
        return text.title()
    return text.lower()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("PermissioN is GRANTed")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input.
The first if statement checks if the input string is in title case or not. If it is not in title case, it returns the title case of the input string.
If the input string is already in title case, it returns the lowercase version of the input string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "PermissioN is GRANTed", we need to check if the input string is in title case or not.
The input string "PermissioN is GRANTed" is not in title case, so the first if statement is executed.
The function returns the title case of the input string, which is "Permission Is Granted".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "PermissioN is GRANTed" is "Permission Is Granted".
<<<Output>>>
'Permission Is Granted'
