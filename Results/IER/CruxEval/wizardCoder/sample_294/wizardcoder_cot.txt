Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n, m, text):
    if text.strip() == '':
        return text
    head, mid, tail = text[0], text[1:-1], text[-1]
    joined = head.replace(n, m) + mid.replace(n, m) + tail.replace(n, m)
    return joined
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("x", "$", "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: n, m, and text.
The first line of the function checks if the text is empty or not. If it is empty, it returns the text as it is.
If the text is not empty, it splits the text into three parts: head, mid, and tail.
The head is the first character of the text, the mid is the substring of the text excluding the first and last characters, and the tail is the last character of the text.
The mid is then replaced with the string m using the replace() method.
The head, mid, and tail are then concatenated to form the final string joined.
The final string joined is then returned as the output of the function f.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris", we need to replace all occurrences of "x" with "$" in the text.
The first character of the text is "2", the mid is "xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hri", and the last character is "s".
The head is "2", the mid is "xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hri", and the tail is "s".
The mid is then replaced with the string "$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri".
The head, mid, and tail are then concatenated to form the final string "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri$s".
The final string "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri$s" is then returned as the output of the function f.

<<<Output>>>
'2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri$s'
