Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n, m):
    arr = list(range(1, n+1))
    for i in range(m):
        arr.clear()
    return arr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(1, 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments n and m.
The first line creates a list of numbers from 1 to n using the range function.
The second line uses a for loop to iterate m times and clears the list arr in each iteration.
Finally, the function returns the list arr.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (1, 3), we need to create a list of numbers from 1 to 1 using the range function.
Then, we need to iterate 3 times and clear the list in each iteration.
After the third iteration, the list will be empty.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (1, 3) is an empty list.
<<<Output>>>
[]
