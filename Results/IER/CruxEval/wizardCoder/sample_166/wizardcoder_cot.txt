Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(graph):
    new_graph = {}
    for key, value in graph.items():
        new_graph[key] = {}
        for subkey in value:
            new_graph[key][subkey] = ''
    return new_graph
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary graph as input and returns a new dictionary new_graph.
The new_graph dictionary is initialized as an empty dictionary.
The for loop iterates over the key-value pairs in the input graph dictionary.
For each key-value pair, a new key-value pair is added to the new_graph dictionary with the same key but an empty value.
The return value of the function is the new_graph dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {}, we need to create an empty dictionary and add an empty value to it for each key in the input dictionary.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {} is {}.
<<<Output>>>{}
