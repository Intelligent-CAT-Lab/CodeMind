Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, sort_count):
    nums.sort()
    return nums[:sort_count]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of integers nums and an integer sort_count.
The function sorts the list nums in ascending order using the sort() method.
The function returns a slice of the sorted list nums, starting from the first element and ending at the sort_count-th element.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1), we need to sort the list [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5] to get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Then we need to return the slice of the sorted list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], starting from the first element and ending at the second element (since sort_count is 1).
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1) is [1].
<<<Output>>>
[1]
