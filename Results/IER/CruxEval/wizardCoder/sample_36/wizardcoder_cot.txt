Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, chars):
    return text.rstrip(chars) if text else text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ha', '')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and chars.
The first parameter, text, is a string that we want to remove characters from the end of.
The second parameter, chars, is a string of characters that we want to remove from the end of text.
If text is not empty, we want to remove the characters in chars from the end of text using the rstrip() method.
If text is empty, we want to return an empty string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "ha" and an empty string for chars, we need to remove the empty string from the end of "ha".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "ha" and an empty string for chars is "ha".
<<<Output>>>
'ha'
