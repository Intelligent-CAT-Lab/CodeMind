Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    counts = 0
    for i in nums:
        if str(i).isdecimal():
            if counts == 0:
                counts += 1
    return counts
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([0, 6, 2, -1, -2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The function initializes a variable counts to 0.
The function iterates through each integer in the list nums.
For each integer i in nums, the function checks if i is a decimal number by converting it to a string and checking if it contains only digits using the isdecimal() method.
If i is a decimal number, the function increments the counts variable by 1.
Finally, the function returns the value of counts, which represents the number of decimal numbers in the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, 2, -1, -2], we need to count the number of decimal numbers in the list [0, 6, 2, -1, -2].
The only decimal number in the list is 6, so the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, 2, -1, -2] is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
