Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    if string[:4]!= 'Nuva':
        return 'no'
    else:
        return string.rstrip()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Nuva?dlfuyjys')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and checks if the first four characters of the string are 'Nuva'. If they are not, it returns 'no'. If they are, it removes any trailing whitespace from the string and returns the modified string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'Nuva?dlfuyjys', we need to check if the first four characters of the string are 'Nuva'. Since they are not, the function returns 'no'. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'Nuva?dlfuyjys' is 'no'.
<<<Output>>>
'no'
