Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(d):
    r = {
        'c': d.copy(),
        'd': d.copy()
    }
    return (r['c'] is r['d'], r['c'] == r['d'])
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets'})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns a tuple of two values.
The first value of the tuple is a boolean value indicating whether the two copies of the dictionary are the same object or not.
The second value of the tuple is a boolean value indicating whether the two copies of the dictionary have the same content or not.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets'}, we need to create two copies of the dictionary and compare them.
The first copy is created by calling the copy() method on the original dictionary.
The second copy is created by calling the copy() method on the first copy.
The two copies are compared using the is and == operators.
The output of executing the function f on the input {'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets'} is (False, False).
<<<Output>>>
(False, False)
