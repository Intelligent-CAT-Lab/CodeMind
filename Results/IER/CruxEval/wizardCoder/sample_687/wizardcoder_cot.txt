Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    t = list(text)
    t.pop(len(t) // 2)
    t.append(text.lower())
    return ':'.join([c for c in t])
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Rjug nzufE')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following operations:
1. Convert the string to a list of characters.
2. Remove the middle character from the list.
3. Append the lowercase version of the original string to the end of the list.
4. Join the list of characters using the ':' separator.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Rjug nzufE", we need to perform the following operations:
1. Convert "Rjug nzufE" to a list of characters: ['R', 'j', 'u', 'g','', 'n', 'z', 'u', 'f', 'E']
2. Remove the middle character from the list: ['R', 'j', 'u', 'g','', 'n', 'z', 'f', 'E']
3. Append the lowercase version of the original string to the end of the list: ['R', 'j', 'u', 'g','', 'n', 'z', 'f', 'e', 'e']
4. Join the list of characters using the ':' separator: 'R:j:u:g: :n:z:f:e:e'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "Rjug nzufE" is "R:j:u:g: :n:z:f:e:e".
<<<Output>>>
'R:j:u:g: :n:z:f:e:e'
