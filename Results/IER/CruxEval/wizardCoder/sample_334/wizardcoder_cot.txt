Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b):
    return a.join(b)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('00', ['nU','9 rCSAz', 'w','lpA5BO','sizL', 'i7rlVr'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a and b.
The first argument a is a string '00' and the second argument b is a list of strings ['nU','9 rCSAz', 'w','lpA5BO','sizL', 'i7rlVr'].
The function joins the elements of the list b with the string '00' using the join() method of the string a.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '00' and ['nU','9 rCSAz', 'w','lpA5BO','sizL', 'i7rlVr'] is '00nU 9 rCSAzw lpA5BOsizLi7rlVr'.
<<<Output>>>
'00nU 9 rCSAzw lpA5BOsizLi7rlVr'
