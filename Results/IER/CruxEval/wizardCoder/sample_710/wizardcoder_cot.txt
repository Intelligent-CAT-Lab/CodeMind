Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(playlist, liker_name, song_index):
    playlist[liker_name] = playlist.get(liker_name, [])
    playlist[liker_name].append(song_index)
    return playlist
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'aki': ['1', '5']}, 'aki', '2')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: playlist, liker_name, and song_index.
The playlist parameter is a dictionary that represents a music playlist.
The liker_name parameter is a string that represents the name of the person who liked a song.
The song_index parameter is a string that represents the index of the song that was liked.

To determine the return value of executing the function f on the input {'aki': ['1', '5']}, 'aki', '2', we need to update the playlist dictionary to include the new like.

The first line of the function creates a new key-value pair in the playlist dictionary, where the key is the liker_name parameter and the value is an empty list.

The second line of the function retrieves the value associated with the liker_name key in the playlist dictionary, or an empty list if the key is not present.

The third line of the function appends the song_index parameter to the list retrieved in the second line.

The fourth line of the function returns the updated playlist dictionary.

Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input {'aki': ['1', '5']}, 'aki', '2' is {'aki': ['1', '5', '2']}.
<<<Output>>>
{'aki': ['1', '5', '2']}
