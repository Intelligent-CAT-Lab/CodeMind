Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, delim):
    first, second = text.split(delim)
    return second + delim + first
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('bpxa24fc5.', '.')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and delim.
The function splits the input string text using the delimiter delim and assigns the two resulting substrings to the variables first and second.
The function returns the concatenation of the second substring with the delimiter delim and the first substring.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "bpxa24fc5.", ".", we need to split the input string into two substrings using the delimiter ".".
The resulting substrings are "bpxa24fc5" and "24fc5".
The function then returns the concatenation of "24fc5" with "." and "bpxa24fc5" with ".", resulting in "24fc5.bpxa24fc5".
<<<Output>>>
'24fc5.bpxa24fc5'
