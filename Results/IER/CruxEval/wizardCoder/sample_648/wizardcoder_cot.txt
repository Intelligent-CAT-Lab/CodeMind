Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(list1, list2):
    l = list1[:]
    while len(l) > 0:
        if l[-1] in list2:
            l.pop()
        else:
            return l[-1]
    return'missing'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([0, 4, 5, 6], [13, 23, -5, 0])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two lists as input, list1 and list2.
The function creates a copy of list1 using the slicing operator [:].
The function then iterates over the copy of list1 using a while loop.
If the last element of the copy of list1 is present in list2, the function removes the last element from the copy of list1 using the pop() method.
If the last element of the copy of list1 is not present in list2, the function returns the last element of the copy of list1.
If the while loop completes without finding a suitable element in list2, the function returns the string'missing'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([0, 4, 5, 6], [13, 23, -5, 0]), we need to iterate over the copy of list1 [0, 4, 5, 6] and check if each element is present in list2 [13, 23, -5, 0].
The last element of the copy of list1 is 6, which is not present in list2. Therefore, the function returns 6 as the output.

<<<Output>>>
6
