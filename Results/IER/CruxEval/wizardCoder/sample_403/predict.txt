What would be the return value of `f('hrsiajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy', 'hr')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, full and part.
The length of the part string is calculated using the len() function.
The find() method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of the part string in the full string.
A while loop is used to count the number of occurrences of the part string in the full string.
The loop starts by finding the index of the first occurrence of the part string in the full string.
The part string is then removed from the full string using slicing.
The find() method is used again to find the index of the next occurrence of the part string in the updated full string.
The loop continues until no more occurrences of the part string are found in the full string.
The count variable is incremented each time an occurrence of the part string is found.
The function returns the count of occurrences of the part string in the full string.

To determine the return value of executing the function f on the input "hrsiajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy" and "hr", we need to count the number of occurrences of the part string "hr" in the full string.

The first occurrence of "hr" is at index 0.
The length of "hr" is 2.
The part string "hr" is found at index 0 in the full string.
The part string "hr" is removed from the full string to get "rsiajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy".
The next occurrence of "hr" is at index 2.
The length of "hr" is 2.
The part string "hr" is found at index 2 in the updated full string.
The part string "hr" is removed from the updated full string to get "siajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy".
The next occurrence of "hr" is at index 4.
The length of "hr" is 2.
The part string "hr" is found at index 4 in the updated full string.
The part string "hr" is removed from the updated full string to get "iajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy".
The next occurrence of "hr" is at index 6.
The length of "hr" is
