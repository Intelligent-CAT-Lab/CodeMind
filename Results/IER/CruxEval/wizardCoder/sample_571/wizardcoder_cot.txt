Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(input_string, spaces):
    return input_string.expandtabs(spaces)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(r'a\tb', 4)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, input_string and spaces.
The input_string is a string with escape characters.
The spaces is an integer value representing the number of spaces to replace with tabs.
The function uses the expandtabs() method to replace the escape characters with tabs.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input r'a\tb' and 4, we need to replace the escape characters with tabs.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input r'a\tb' and 4 is 'a\tb'.
<<<Output>>>
'a\tb'
