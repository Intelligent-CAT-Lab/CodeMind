Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(container, cron):
    if not cron in container:
        return container
    pref = container[:container.index(cron)].copy()
    suff = container[container.index(cron) + 1:].copy()
    return pref + suff
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([], 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, container and cron.
The container is a list and cron is an integer.
The function checks if cron is present in the container.
If cron is not present in the container, the function returns the container as it is.
If cron is present in the container, the function creates two new lists, pref and suff.
The pref list contains all the elements of the container before the index of cron.
The suff list contains all the elements of the container after the index of cron.
The function returns the concatenation of pref and suff.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [], 2, we need to check if 2 is present in the list [].
Since 2 is not present in the list [], the function returns the list [].

<<<Output>>>
[]
