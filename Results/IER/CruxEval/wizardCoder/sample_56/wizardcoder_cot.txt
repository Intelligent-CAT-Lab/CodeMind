Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(sentence):
    for c in sentence:
        if c.isascii() is False:
            return False
        else:
            continue
    return True
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('1z1z1')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string sentence as input and iterates over each character in the string.
For each character, it checks if it is an ASCII character using the isascii() method.
If the character is not an ASCII character, the function immediately returns False.
If all characters in the string are ASCII characters, the function returns True.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '1z1z1', we need to iterate over each character in the string.
The first character '1' is not an ASCII character, so the function immediately returns False.
The second character 'z' is not an ASCII character, so the function immediately returns False.
The third character '1' is not an ASCII character, so the function immediately returns False.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '1z1z1' is False.
<<<Output>>>
False
