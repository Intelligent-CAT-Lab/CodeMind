Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(original, string):
    temp = dict(original)
    for a, b in string.items():
        temp[b] = a
    return temp
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({1: -9, 0: -7}, {1: 2, 0: 3})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two dictionaries as input: original and string.
The original dictionary contains key-value pairs where the keys are integers and the values are integers.
The string dictionary contains key-value pairs where the keys are integers and the values are integers.

The function creates a new dictionary called temp, which is a copy of the original dictionary.
The function then iterates over the key-value pairs in the string dictionary.
For each key-value pair, the function sets the value of the corresponding key in the temp dictionary to the value of the key in the string dictionary.

Finally, the function returns the temp dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {1: -9, 0: -7}, {1: 2, 0: 3}, we need to create a new dictionary with the same key-value pairs as the original dictionary, except for the values that are swapped.

The value of the key 1 in the original dictionary is -9, and the value of the key 2 in the string dictionary is 2.
Therefore, the value of the key 1 in the new dictionary should be 2.
The value of the key 0 in the original dictionary is -7, and the value of the key 3 in the string dictionary is 3.
Therefore, the value of the key 0 in the new dictionary should be 3.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {1: -9, 0: -7}, {1: 2, 0: 3} is {1: 2, 0: 3}.
<<<Output>>>
{1: 2, 0: 3}
