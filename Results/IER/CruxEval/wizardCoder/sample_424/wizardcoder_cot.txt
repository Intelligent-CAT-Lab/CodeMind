Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    s = s.replace('"', '')
    lst = list(s)
    col = 0
    count = 1
    while col < len(lst) and lst[col] in ".:,":
        if lst[col] == ".":
            count = ls[col] + 1
        col += 1
    return s[col+count:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('"Makers of a Statement"')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the substring of s starting from the first non-punctuation character after the first occurrence of a period.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '"Makers of a Statement"', we need to remove the double quotes from the input and then find the first occurrence of a period. We then count the number of periods and move to the character after the period. Finally, we return the substring starting from the character after the period.
<<<Output>>>
'akers of a Statement'
