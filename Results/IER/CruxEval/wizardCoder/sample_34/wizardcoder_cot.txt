Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, odd1, odd2):
    while odd1 in nums:
        nums.remove(odd1)
    while odd2 in nums:
        nums.remove(odd2)
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3], 3, 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: nums, odd1, and odd2.
The nums argument is a list of integers.
The odd1 and odd2 arguments are integers.

The function first removes all occurrences of odd1 and odd2 from the nums list using a while loop.

After removing the occurrences of odd1 and odd2, the function returns the modified nums list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3], 3, 1), we need to remove all occurrences of 3 and 1 from the list [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3].

After removing all occurrences of 3 and 1, the modified list is [2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 3, 21, 3, 21].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3], 3, 1) is [2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 3, 21, 3, 21].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 3, 21, 3, 21]
