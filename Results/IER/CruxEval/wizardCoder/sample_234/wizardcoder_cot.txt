Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    position = len(text)
    if char in text:
        position = text.index(char)
        if position > 1:
            position = (position + 1) % len(text)
    return position
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('wduhzxlfk', 'w')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and char.
The function first initializes the position variable to the length of the text string.
The function then checks if the char is present in the text string.
If the char is present, the function updates the position variable to the index of the first occurrence of the char in the text string.
If the position variable is greater than 1, the function updates the position variable to the next index in the text string.
If the char is not present in the text string, the function returns the position variable.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "wduhzxlfk" and the character 'w', we need to find the index of the first occurrence of 'w' in the text string 'wduhzxlfk'.
The index of the first occurrence of 'w' is 0.
Since the position variable is greater than 1, the function updates the position variable to the next index in the text string, which is 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "wduhzxlfk" and the character 'w' is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
