Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(update, starting):
    d = starting.copy()
    for k in update:
        if k in d:
            d[k] += update[k]
        else:
            d[k] = update[k]
    return d
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({}, {'desciduous': 2})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two dictionaries as input: update and starting.
The update dictionary contains the changes to be made to the starting dictionary.
The starting dictionary contains the initial values for the keys in the update dictionary.
The function creates a copy of the starting dictionary and then iterates over the keys in the update dictionary.
For each key in the update dictionary, if the key is already in the copy of the starting dictionary, the value in the copy is incremented by the value in the update dictionary.
If the key is not in the copy of the starting dictionary, it is added with the value from the update dictionary.
Finally, the function returns the updated copy of the starting dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `({}, {'desciduous': 2})`, we need to create a copy of the starting dictionary, which is `{'desciduous': 2}`.
Then, we iterate over the keys in the update dictionary, which is `{}`.
Since there are no keys in the update dictionary, the function does not modify the copy of the starting dictionary.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `({}, {'desciduous': 2})` is `{'desciduous': 2}`.
<<<Output>>>
{'desciduous': 2}
