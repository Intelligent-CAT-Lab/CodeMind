Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    return text.replace('\n', '\t')
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('apples\n\t\npears\n\t\nbananas')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the string with all the newline characters replaced with tab characters.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "apples\n\t\npears\n\t\nbananas", we need to replace all the newline characters with tab characters.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "apples\n\t\npears\n\t\nbananas" is "apples\t\tpears\t\tbananas".
<<<Output>>>
'apples\t\tpears\t\tbananas'
