What would be the return value of `f((32332, 23543, 132323, 33300), ',')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a tuple_list and a joint as input.
The tuple_list contains a list of integers.
The joint is a string that is used to join the integers in the tuple_list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (32332, 23543, 132323, 33300), ','), we need to concatenate the integers in the tuple_list with the joint.

The first integer in the tuple_list is 32332. We need to concatenate it with the joint.
The joint is a comma, so we need to concatenate it with the string representation of 32332.
The string representation of 32332 is '32332'.
Therefore, the first part of the output is '32332'.

The second integer in the tuple_list is 23543. We need to concatenate it with the joint.
The joint is a comma, so we need to concatenate it with the string representation of 23543.
The string representation of 23543 is '23543'.
Therefore, the second part of the output is '23543'.

The third integer in the tuple_list is 132323. We need to concatenate it with the joint.
The joint is a comma, so we need to concatenate it with the string representation of 132323.
The string representation of 132323 is '132323'.
Therefore, the third part of the output is '132323'.

The fourth integer in the tuple_list is 33300. We need to concatenate it with the joint.
The joint is a comma, so we need to concatenate it with the string representation of 33300.
The string representation of 33300 is '33300'.
Therefore, the fourth part of the output is '33300'.

Finally, we concatenate the four parts of the output with the joint.
The joint is a comma, so we need to concatenate it with the four parts of the
