Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(filename):
    suffix = filename.split('.')[-1]
    f2 = filename + suffix[::-1]
    return f2.endswith(suffix)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('docs.doc')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a filename as input and returns True if the filename ends with its suffix, otherwise False.
The suffix of the filename 'docs.doc' is 'doc'.
The function f first splits the filename into a list of its components using the '.' separator.
The last component of the list is the suffix.
The function f then creates a new filename by concatenating the original filename with its suffix reversed.
The reversed suffix is obtained by slicing the suffix with a step of -1.
Finally, the function f checks if the new filename ends with its suffix.
The new filename is 'docsoc.doc', which ends with the suffix 'doc'.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input 'docs.doc' is True.
<<<Output>>>True
