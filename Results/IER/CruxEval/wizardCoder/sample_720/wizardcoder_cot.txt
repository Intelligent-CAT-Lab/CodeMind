Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(items, item):
    while items[-1] == item:
        items.pop()
    items.append(item)
    return len(items)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf'.split('-'), 'n')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, items and item.
The items argument is a list of strings, and the item argument is a string.
The function modifies the list of strings by removing all occurrences of the last element of the list if it is equal to the item argument.
Then, the function appends the item argument to the end of the list.
Finally, the function returns the length of the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf'.split('-'), 'n', we need to remove all occurrences of 'n' from the list of strings and then append 'n' to the end of the list.
Therefore, the modified list is ['bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneao'].
The length of the modified list is 1.

The return value of the function f on the input 'bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf'.split('-'), 'n' is 1.
<<<Output>>>1
