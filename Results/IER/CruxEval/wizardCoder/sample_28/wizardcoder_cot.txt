Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(mylist):
    revl = mylist[:]
    revl.reverse()
    mylist.sort(reverse=True)
    return mylist == revl
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, 8])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list mylist as input.
The first line creates a copy of the list using slicing.
The second line reverses the copy of the list.
The third line sorts the original list in reverse order.
The fourth line compares the original list with the reversed list using the "==" operator.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8], we need to perform the following steps:
1. Create a copy of the list [5, 8] using slicing.
2. Reverse the copy of the list [8, 5].
3. Sort the original list [5, 8] in reverse order.
4. Compare the original list [5, 8] with the reversed list [8, 5] using the "==" operator.
The result of the comparison is True because the original list and the reversed list are equal.
<<<Output>>>
True
