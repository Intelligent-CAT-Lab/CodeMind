What would be the return value of `f(372359)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer n as input and returns a string b.
The variable t is initialized to 0 and b is initialized to an empty string.
The digits of n are obtained by converting n to a string and then mapping each character to an integer using the map function.
The for loop iterates over the digits of n, starting from the leftmost digit.
If the current digit is 0, t is incremented by 1.
If the current digit is not 0, the for loop is terminated using the break statement.
The for loop is then repeated t times, adding the string "104" to b for each iteration.
Finally, the string representation of n is concatenated to b and returned as the output.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 372359, we need to concatenate the string "104" t times to the string representation of n.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 372359 is "1041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041041
