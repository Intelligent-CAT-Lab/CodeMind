Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    return nums[len(nums)//2]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-1, -3, -5, -7, 0])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input and returns the middle element of the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, -3, -5, -7, 0], we need to find the middle element of the list.
The middle element of the list is the one that is located at index len(nums)//2, where len(nums) is the length of the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, -3, -5, -7, 0] is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
