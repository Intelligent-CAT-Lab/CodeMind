Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, value):
    indexes = list()
    for i in range(len(text)):
        if text[i] == value:
            indexes.append(i)
    new_text = list(text)
    for i in indexes:
        new_text.remove(value)
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('scedvtvotkwqfoqn', 'o')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and value.
The function creates an empty list called indexes.
The function loops through each character in the text string and checks if it matches the value parameter.
If it does, the index of the character is appended to the indexes list.
The function creates a new list called new_text by copying the characters from the original text string.
The function loops through each index in the indexes list and removes the character at that index from the new_text list.
Finally, the function returns the new_text list as a string by joining the characters together.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "scedvtvotkwqfoqn" and value "o", we need to remove all occurrences of the character "o" from the string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "scedvtvotkwqfoqn" and value "o" is "scedvtvtkwqfn".
<<<Output>>>
'scedvtvtkwqfn'
