Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(students):
    seatlist = students
    seatlist.reverse()
    cnt = 0
    for cnt in range(len(seatlist)):
        cnt += 2
        seatlist[cnt - 1:cnt] = ['+']
    seatlist.append('+')
    return seatlist
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['r', '9'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of students as input and returns a modified list of students.
The modified list of students is obtained by reversing the original list of students.
Then, the modified list of students is modified by adding the string "+" to alternate positions in the list.
The modified list of students is returned as the output of the function f.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['r', '9'], we need to reverse the list ['r', '9'] to get ['9', 'r'].
Then, we need to add the string "+" to alternate positions in the list ['9', 'r'].
Therefore, the modified list of students is ['9', '+', 'r', '+'].

<<<Output>>>
['9', '+', 'r', '+']
