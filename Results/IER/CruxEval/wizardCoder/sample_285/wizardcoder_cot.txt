Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, ch):
    """Counting vowels in Pirates' Curse"""
    return text.count(ch)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!",'')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, text and ch.
The text argument is a string that contains the text to be analyzed.
The ch argument is a character that is used to count the number of occurrences of that character in the text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!" and the character'', we need to count the number of occurrences of the space character in the text.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!" and the character'' is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
