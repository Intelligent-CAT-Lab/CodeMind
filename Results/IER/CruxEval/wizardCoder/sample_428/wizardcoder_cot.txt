Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if not i % 2:
            nums.append(nums[i] * nums[i + 1])
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input.
The for loop iterates over the indices of the list nums.
The if statement checks if the current index i is even or odd.
If i is even, the code appends the square of the current number to the list nums.
If i is odd, the code does nothing.
Finally, the function returns the modified list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [], we need to iterate over an empty list and append the square of each number to the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [] is [].
<<<Output>>>
[]
