Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(strs):
    strs = strs.split()
    for i in range(1, len(strs), 2):
        strs[i] = ''.join(reversed(strs[i]))
    return''.join(strs)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('K zBK')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string strs as input and returns a new string that is the concatenation of the reversed words in strs.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "K zBK", we need to split the input string into words "K" and "zBK".
The first word "K" is not reversed, so it is not included in the output.
The second word "zBK" is reversed to "KBZ", so the output is "KBZ".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "K zBK" is "KBZ".
<<<Output>>>
'KBZ'
