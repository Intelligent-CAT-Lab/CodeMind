Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(num):
    letter = 1
    for i in '1234567890':
        num = num.replace(i,'')
        if len(num) == 0: break
        num = num[letter:] + num[:letter]
        letter += 1
    return num
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('bwmm7h')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string num as input and returns the string with all digits removed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "bwmm7h", we need to remove all digits from the string.
The first step is to replace all digits with an empty string using the replace() method.
The second step is to check if the resulting string is empty. If it is, we have removed all digits and can return the empty string.
If the resulting string is not empty, we need to reverse the string using slicing.
The third step is to return the reversed string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "bwmm7h" is "bwmh".
<<<Output>>>
'bwmh'
