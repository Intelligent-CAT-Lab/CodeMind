Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, substr, occ):
    n = 0
    while True:
        i = text.rfind(substr)
        if i == -1:
            break
        elif n == occ:
            return i
        else:
            n += 1
            text = text[:i]
    return -1
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('zjegiymjc', 'j', 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, substr, and occ.
The text parameter is a string that contains the text to search in.
The substr parameter is a string that represents the substring to search for.
The occ parameter is an integer that represents the occurrence of the substring to search for.

The function f uses a while loop to search for the last occurrence of the substring in the text.
The loop starts by setting the variable i to -1, which is the index of the last character in the text.
The loop then enters a loop that continues until the substring is not found in the text.
Inside the loop, the function f uses the rfind method to search for the last occurrence of the substring in the text.
If the substring is found, the function f increments the variable n by 1 and updates the value of the text variable to exclude the last occurrence of the substring.
If the variable n reaches the value of the occ parameter, the function f returns the index of the last occurrence of the substring in the text.
If the loop completes without finding the substring, the function f returns -1 to indicate that the substring was not found in the text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "zjegiymjc", "j", and 2, we need to search for the last occurrence of the substring "j" in the text "zjegiymjc" and return the index of the second occurrence.

The function f first initializes the variable n to 0.
The function f then enters the while loop and searches for the last occurrence of the substring "j" in the text "zjegiymjc".
The function f finds the last occurrence of "j" at index 5, which is the second occurrence of "j" in the text.
The function f increments the value of n to 1 and updates the value of the text variable to exclude the last occurrence of "j".
The function f then enters the while loop again and searches for the last occurrence of "j" in the updated text "zjegiymjc".
The function f finds the last occurrence of "j" at index 2, which is the second occurrence of "j" in the text.
The function f increments the value of n to 2 and updates the value of the text variable to exclude
