Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    k = 0
    l = array.copy()
    for i in l:
        if i > elem:
            array.insert(k, elem)
            break
        k += 1
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, an array and an element elem.
The function creates a copy of the input array and initializes a variable k to 0.
The function iterates through the copy of the input array and checks if each element is greater than the input element elem.
If an element is greater than elem, the function inserts the input element elem at the index k and breaks out of the loop.
If no element is greater than elem, the function increments the value of k and continues iterating through the copy of the input array.
Finally, the function returns the modified input array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] and elem=3, we need to insert 3 at the index 2 of the input array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] and elem=3 is [5, 4, 3, 3, 1, 0].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 4, 3, 3, 1, 0]
