Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(student_marks, name):
    if name in student_marks:
        value = student_marks.pop(name)
        return value
    return 'Name unknown'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'882afmfp': 56}, '6f53p')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a dictionary student_marks and a string name.
The dictionary student_marks contains the marks of different students.
The string name represents the name of the student whose mark we want to retrieve.

If the name is present in the dictionary student_marks, we pop the value corresponding to the name from the dictionary and return it.
If the name is not present in the dictionary, we return the string 'Name unknown'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'882afmfp': 56}, '6f53p', we need to check if '6f53p' is present in the dictionary {'882afmfp': 56}.
'6f53p' is not present in the dictionary, so the function returns the string 'Name unknown'.
<<<Output>>>
'Name unknown'
