Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, len(text)):
        s += len(text.rpartition(text[i])[0])
    return s
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('wdj')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the sum of the lengths of all the substrings of text that are formed by removing one character at a time.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "wdj", we need to remove one character at a time and calculate the length of each substring.
The substrings of "wdj" that are formed by removing one character at a time are: "w", "wd", "wdj", "d", "dj", "j".
The lengths of these substrings are: 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "wdj" is 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
