Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, suffix, num):
    str_num = str(num)
    return text.endswith(suffix + str_num)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('friends and love', 'and', 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, suffix, and num.
The text parameter is a string that represents the original text.
The suffix parameter is a string that represents the suffix that we want to check if the text ends with.
The num parameter is an integer that represents the number that we want to append to the suffix to form the final string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "friends and love", "and", and 3, we need to check if the text ends with the concatenated string "and3".

The function f first converts the integer num to a string using the str() function.
Then it concatenates the suffix and the string representation of num to form the final string "and3".
Finally, it checks if the text ends with the final string using the endswith() method.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "friends and love", "and", and 3 is True.
<<<Output>>>
True
