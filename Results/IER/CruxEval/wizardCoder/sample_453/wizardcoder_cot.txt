Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string, c):
    return string.endswith(c)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('wrsch)xjmb8', 'c')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, string and c.
The string argument is a string that we want to check if it ends with the character c.
The c argument is the character we want to check if the string ends with.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "wrsch)xjmb8" and 'c', we need to check if the string "wrsch)xjmb8" ends with the character 'c'.
The string "wrsch)xjmb8" does not end with the character 'c'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "wrsch)xjmb8" and 'c' is False.
<<<Output>>>
False
