Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, value):
    text_list = list(text)
    text_list.append(value)
    return ''.join(text_list)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('bcksrut', 'q')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and value.
The first line of the function converts the input text into a list of characters using the list() function.
The second line appends the value to the end of the list.
The third line joins the list of characters back into a string using the ''.join() function.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "bcksrut" and "q", we need to convert "bcksrut" into a list of characters, append "q" to the end of the list, and then join the list of characters back into a string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "bcksrut" and "q" is "bcksrutq".
<<<Output>>>
'bcksrutq'
