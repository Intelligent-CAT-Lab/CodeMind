Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    if str(n).find('.')!= -1:
        return str(int(n)+2.5)
    return str(n)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('800')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a number n as input and checks if it contains a decimal point. If it does, it converts the number to an integer and adds 2.5 to it, and then converts the result back to a string. If it doesn't contain a decimal point, it simply converts the number to a string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "800", we need to check if it contains a decimal point. Since it does, we convert it to an integer (800) and add 2.5 to it (802.5), and then convert the result back to a string ("802"). If it doesn't contain a decimal point, we simply convert the number to a string ("800").
<<<Output>>>
'802'
