Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, to_place):
    after_place = text[:text.find(to_place, 0) + 1]
    before_place = text[text.find(to_place, 0) + 1:]
    return after_place + before_place
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('some text','some')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and to_place.
The function first finds the index of the first occurrence of the substring to_place in the string text using the find() method.
The function then extracts the substring of text from the index of the first occurrence of to_place to the end of the string using slicing.
The function then extracts the substring of text from the beginning of the string to the index of the first occurrence of to_place + 1 using slicing.
Finally, the function returns the concatenation of the two substrings obtained in the previous step.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "some text" and "some", we need to concatenate the substring of "some text" from the beginning to the index of the first occurrence of "some" + 1 with the substring of "some text" from the index of the first occurrence of "some" + 1 to the end.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "some text" and "some" is "some text".
<<<Output>>>
'some text'
