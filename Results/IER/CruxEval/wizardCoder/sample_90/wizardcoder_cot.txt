Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    return_arr = []
    for a in array:
        return_arr.append(a.copy())
    return return_arr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array with the same elements as the input array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]], we need to create a new array with the same elements as the input array.
The new array should have three sub-arrays, each containing the same elements as the corresponding sub-array in the input array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]] is [[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]].
<<<Output>>>
[[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]]
