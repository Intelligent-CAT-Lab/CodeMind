Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, p):
    prev_p = p - 1
    if prev_p < 0: prev_p = len(nums) - 1
    return nums[prev_p]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7], 6)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a list of numbers nums and an integer p.
The function first calculates the previous index of p in the list using the formula prev_p = p - 1.
If prev_p is less than 0, it is set to the last index of the list.
The function then returns the value of the element at index prev_p in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7], 6), we need to calculate the previous index of 6 in the list.
The previous index of 6 is 5, so the function returns the value of the element at index 5, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
