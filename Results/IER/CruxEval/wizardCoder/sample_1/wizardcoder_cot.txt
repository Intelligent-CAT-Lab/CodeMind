Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b, c):
    result = {}
    for d in a, b, c:
        result.update(dict.fromkeys(d))
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f((1, ), (1, ), (1, 2))`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments a, b, and c.
The first line creates an empty dictionary called result.
The second line iterates over the three arguments a, b, and c using a for loop.
For each argument d, the third line creates a new dictionary from the keys of d using the dict.fromkeys() method.
The fourth line updates the result dictionary with the new dictionary from the keys of d.
Finally, the fifth line returns the result dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (1, 1, 1, 2), we need to create a dictionary with keys 1, 1, and 2.
The first argument (1, ) creates a dictionary with key 1.
The second argument (1, ) creates a dictionary with key 1.
The third argument (1, 2) creates a dictionary with keys 1 and 2.
The result dictionary is updated with the dictionaries from the keys of the three arguments.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (1, 1, 1, 2) is {1: None, 2: None}.
<<<Output>>>
{1: None, 2: None}
