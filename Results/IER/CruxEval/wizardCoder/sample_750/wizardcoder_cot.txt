Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(char_map, text):
    new_text = ''
    for ch in text:
        val = char_map.get(ch)
        if val is None:
            new_text += ch
        else:
            new_text += val
    return new_text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({}, 'hbd')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a dictionary char_map and a string text.
The function initializes an empty string new_text.
The function iterates over each character ch in the string text.
For each character ch, the function retrieves the corresponding value from the dictionary char_map using the get() method.
If the value is None, the function appends the character ch to the new_text string.
If the value is not None, the function appends the value to the new_text string.
Finally, the function returns the new_text string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {}, 'hbd', we need to initialize an empty string new_text.
Then, we iterate over each character ch in the string 'hbd'.
For the character 'h', the function retrieves the corresponding value from the dictionary {}, which is None.
Therefore, the function appends 'h' to the new_text string.
For the character 'b', the function retrieves the corresponding value from the dictionary {}, which is None.
Therefore, the function appends 'b' to the new_text string.
For the character 'd', the function retrieves the corresponding value from the dictionary {}, which is None.
Therefore, the function appends 'd' to the new_text string.
Finally, the function returns the new_text string, which is 'hbd'.
<<<Output>>>
'hbd'
