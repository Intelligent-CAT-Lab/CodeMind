Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    ls = text[::-1]
    text2 = ''
    for i in range(len(ls) - 3, 0, -3):
        text2 += '---'.join(ls[i:i + 3]) + '---'
    return text2[:-3]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('scala')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string.
The string text is reversed using slicing and stored in the variable ls.
A new string text2 is initialized as an empty string.
The for loop iterates over the indices of ls starting from the third last index and ending at the second index in steps of -3.
For each iteration, the slice ls[i:i+3] is joined using the '---' separator and appended to text2.
Finally, the last three characters of text2 are removed using slicing and the resulting string is returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "scala", we need to reverse the string "scala" to get "lasca".
Then, we iterate over the indices of "lasca" starting from the third last index and ending at the second index in steps of -3.
For each iteration, we join the slice "lasca"[i:i+3] using the '---' separator to get "---las---".
We append this string to text2.
Finally, we remove the last three characters of text2 to get "---las".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "scala" is "---las".
<<<Output>>>
'---las'
