Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, chars):
    if chars:
        text = text.rstrip(chars)
    else:
        text = text.rstrip(' ')
    if text == '':
        return '-'
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', '0123456789-')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and chars.
The first if statement checks if chars is not empty. If it is not empty, it removes the specified characters from the right end of the text using the rstrip() method.
The second if statement checks if the resulting text is empty. If it is empty, it returns the string '-'.
If the resulting text is not empty, it returns the text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', '0123456789-', we need to remove the specified characters from the right end of the text.
The specified characters are '0123456789-'.
The resulting text is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'.
The second if statement checks if the resulting text is empty. Since the resulting text is not empty, it returns the text.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', '0123456789-' is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'.
<<<Output>>>
'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'
