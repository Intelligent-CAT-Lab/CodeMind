Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, prefix):
    idx = 0
    for letter in prefix:
        if text[idx]!= letter:
            return None
        idx += 1
    return text[idx:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('bestest', 'bestest')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, text and prefix.
The prefix is a string that is compared with the first few characters of the text.
If the prefix does not match the text, the function returns None.
If the prefix matches the text, the function returns the remaining part of the text after the prefix.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "bestest" and "bestest", we need to compare the prefix "bestest" with the first few characters of the text "bestest".
The first few characters of the text are "bestest", so the prefix matches the text.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "bestest" and "bestest" is "test".
<<<Output>>>
'test'
