Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, separator):
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == separator:
            new_s = list(s)
            new_s[i] = '/'
            return''.join(new_s)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('h grateful k','')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, s and separator.
The separator parameter is used to split the string s into a list of words.
The function iterates over each character in the string s and checks if it matches the separator.
If it does, the function creates a new list of characters by copying the original list of characters and replacing the separator character with '/'.
The function then joins the list of characters with a space separator and returns the resulting string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'h grateful k' and separator'', we need to split the string into a list of words and replace the separator character with '/'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'h grateful k' and separator'' is 'h/grateful/k'.
<<<Output>>>
'h/grateful/k'
