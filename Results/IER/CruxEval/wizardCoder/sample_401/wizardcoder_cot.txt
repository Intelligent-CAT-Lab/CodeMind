Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, suffix):
    if suffix and text.endswith(suffix):
        return text[:- len(suffix)]
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('mathematics', 'example')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and suffix.
The if statement checks if the suffix is not empty and if the text ends with the suffix.
If both conditions are true, the function returns the text with the suffix removed.
If the conditions are not met, the function returns the original text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "mathematics" and "example", we need to check if "mathematics" ends with "example".
Since "mathematics" does not end with "example", the function returns "mathematics".
<<<Output>>>
'mathematics'
