Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(numbers, index):
    for n in numbers[index:]:
        numbers.insert(index, n)
        index += 1
    return numbers[:index]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-2, 4, -4], 0)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a list of numbers and an index.
The function iterates over the list of numbers starting from the index and inserts each number at the current index.
The function returns a slice of the list from the beginning up to the current index.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-2, 4, -4], 0), we need to insert each number in the list at the beginning of the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-2, 4, -4], 0) is [-2, -4, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[-2, -4, 4]
