What would be the return value of `f("xabxfiwoexahxaxbxs", "xbabcabccb")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, perc and full.
The function initializes a variable reply to an empty string.
The function initializes a variable i to 0.
The function enters a while loop that continues as long as i is less than the length of perc and i is less than the length of full.
Inside the while loop, the function checks if perc[i] is equal to full[i].
If perc[i] is equal to full[i], the function appends the string "yes " to the variable reply.
If perc[i] is not equal to full[i], the function appends the string "no " to the variable reply.
The function increments i by 1.
The function returns the value of the variable reply.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "xabxfiwoexahxaxbxs" and "xbabcabccb", we need to compare the characters of the two strings and determine if they match.

The first character of perc is "x", the first character of full is "x".
The function appends the string "yes " to the variable reply.

The second character of perc is "a", the second character of full is "b".
The function appends the string "no " to the variable reply.

The third character of perc is "b", the third character of full is "c".
The function appends the string "yes " to the variable reply.

The fourth character of perc is "x", the fourth character of full is "a".
The function appends the string "no " to the variable reply.

The fifth character of perc is "f", the fifth character of full is "b".
The function appends the string "yes " to the variable reply.

The sixth character of perc is "i", the sixth character of full is "c".
The function appends the string "yes " to the variable reply.

The seventh character of perc is "w", the seventh character of full is "b".
The function appends the string "no " to the variable reply.

The eighth character of perc is "o", the eighth character of full is "c
