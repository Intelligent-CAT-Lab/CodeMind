Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, position, value):
   length = len(text)
   index = position % (length)
   if position < 0:
       index = length // 2
   new_text = list(text)
   new_text.insert(index, value)
   new_text.pop(length-1)
   return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('sduyai', 1, 'y')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, position, and value.
The first parameter, text, is a string that represents the original text.
The second parameter, position, is an integer that represents the position where the new character should be inserted.
The third parameter, value, is a string that represents the new character to be inserted.

The function first calculates the length of the text using the len() function.
Then, it calculates the index of the character to be inserted using the modulo operator (%).
If the position is negative, the index is set to the middle of the text.

Next, the function creates a new list from the original text using the list() function.
The new character is inserted at the calculated index using the insert() method.
The last character of the list is removed using the pop() method.

Finally, the function returns the modified text as a string using the join() method.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "sduyai", 1, and "y", we need to insert "y" at position 1 in the text "sduyai".
The index of the character to be inserted is 1, which is the second character of the text.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "sduyai", 1, and "y" is "sdyua".
<<<Output>>>
'sdyua'
