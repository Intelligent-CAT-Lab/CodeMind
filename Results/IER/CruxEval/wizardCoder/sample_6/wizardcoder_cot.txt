Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(dic):
    for k,v in sorted(dic.items(), key=lambda x: len(str(x)))[:-1]:
        dic.pop(k)
    return list(dic.items())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'11': 52, '65': 34, 'a': 12, '4': 52, '74': 31})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary dic as input.
The function iterates over the items of the dictionary dic and sorts them based on the length of the string representation of the key.
The function removes the last item from the sorted list of items.
The function returns the list of remaining items in the dictionary.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'11': 52, '65': 34, 'a': 12, '4': 52, '74': 31}, we need to sort the items of the dictionary based on the length of the string representation of the key, remove the last item, and return the list of remaining items.
The sorted list of items would be [('a', 12), ('4', 52), ('11', 52), ('74', 31)], and the last item would be ('65', 34).
The function would then remove the last item from the sorted list of items, which would be ('65', 34).
The remaining items in the dictionary would be [('a', 12), ('4', 52), ('11', 52), ('74', 31)].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'11': 52, '65': 34, 'a': 12, '4': 52, '74': 31} is [('a', 12), ('4', 52), ('11', 52), ('74', 31)].
<<<Output>>>
[('a', 12), ('4', 52), ('11', 52), ('74', 31)]
