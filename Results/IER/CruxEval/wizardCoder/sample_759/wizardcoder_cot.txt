Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, sub):
    index = []
    starting = 0
    while starting!= -1:
        starting = text.find(sub, starting)
        if starting!= -1:
            index.append(starting)
            starting += len(sub)
    return index
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('egmdartoa', 'good')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and sub.
The function initializes an empty list index to store the starting indices of sub in text.
The function initializes a variable starting to 0.
The function enters a while loop that continues until starting is equal to -1.
Inside the while loop, the function finds the starting index of sub in text starting from the index starting.
If the starting index is not equal to -1, the function appends the starting index to the list index and updates the starting index by adding the length of sub to it.
The function continues the while loop until starting is equal to -1.
The function returns the list index.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "egmdartoa" and "good", we need to find the starting indices of "good" in "egmdartoa".
The starting indices of "good" in "egmdartoa" are 0, 5, and 10.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "egmdartoa" and "good" is [0, 5, 10].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 5, 10]
