Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    ls = list(text)
    total = (len(text) - 1) * 2
    for i in range(1, total+1):
        if i % 2:
            ls.append('+')
        else:
            ls.insert(0, '+')
    return ''.join(ls).rjust(total)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('taole')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string that contains the input string with the characters '+' inserted in odd positions and appended in even positions.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "taole", we need to insert '+' in odd positions and append '+' in even positions.
The first character of the input string is at position 0, the second character is at position 1, and so on.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "taole" is "ta+o+le".
<<<Output>>>
'ta+o+le'
