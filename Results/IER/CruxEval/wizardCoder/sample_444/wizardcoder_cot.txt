Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    count = len(nums)
    for i in range(count-1, 0, -2):
        nums.insert(i, nums.pop(0) + nums.pop(0))
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-5, 3, -2, -3, -1, 3, 5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The first line initializes a variable count to the length of the input list.
The second line uses a for loop to iterate over the indices of the list in reverse order, starting from the second-to-last index and decrementing by 2 in each iteration.
Inside the loop, the function uses the insert() method to insert the sum of the first two elements of the list at the current index, and then uses the pop() method to remove the first two elements of the list.
The function continues to iterate over the list in reverse order until it reaches the first index.
Finally, the function returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-5, 3, -2, -3, -1, 3, 5], we need to apply the function to the input list and print the result.

The first iteration of the loop will insert the sum of -5 and 3 at index 1 (i.e., nums[1]), and remove the first two elements of the list, resulting in [-5, 8].
The second iteration of the loop will insert the sum of 8 and -2 at index 0 (i.e., nums[0]), and remove the first two elements of the list, resulting in [10].
The third iteration of the loop will insert the sum of 10 and -3 at index 0 (i.e., nums[0]), and remove the first two elements of the list, resulting in [13].
The fourth iteration of the loop will insert the sum of 13 and -1 at index 0 (i.e., nums[0]), and remove the first two elements of the list, resulting in [14].
The fifth iteration of the loop will insert the sum of 14 and 3 at index 1 (i.e., nums[1]), and remove the first two elements of the list, resulting in [14, 7].
The sixth iteration of the loop will insert the sum of 7 and 5 at index 2 (i.e., nums[2]), and remove the first two elements of the list, resulting in [14, 7, 12].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the
