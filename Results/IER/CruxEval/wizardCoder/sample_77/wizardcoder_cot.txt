Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, character):
    subject = text[text.rfind(character):]
    return subject*text.count(character)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('h,lpvvkohh,u', 'i')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and character.
The variable subject is assigned the substring of text that starts from the last occurrence of character and continues to the end of the string.
The function returns the subject repeated the number of times it appears in the text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "h,lpvvkohh,u" and 'i', we need to find the last occurrence of 'i' in the string "h,lpvvkohh,u" which is at index 2.
The substring of text that starts from the last occurrence of 'i' and continues to the end of the string is "h,lpvvkohh,u".
The variable subject is assigned the value "h,lpvvkohh,u".
The function returns the subject repeated the number of times it appears in the text which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
'h,lpvvkohh,u'
