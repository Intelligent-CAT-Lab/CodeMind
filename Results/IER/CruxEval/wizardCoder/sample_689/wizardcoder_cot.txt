Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(arr):
    count = len(arr)
    sub = arr.copy()
    for i in range(0, count, 2):
        sub[i] *= 5
    return sub
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-3, -6, 2, 7])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array arr as input and returns a new array with each even index element multiplied by 5.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-3, -6, 2, 7], we need to create a new array with the same length as the input array.
We can use the copy() method to create a new array with the same elements as the input array.
Next, we can loop through the input array and multiply each even index element by 5.
Finally, we can return the new array with the modified elements.
<<<Output>>>
[15, -30, 10, 35]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
