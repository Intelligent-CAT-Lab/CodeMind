Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, mos):
    for num in mos:
        nums.pop(nums.index(num))
    nums.sort()
    for num in mos:
        nums += [num]
    for i in range(len(nums)-1):
        if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:
            return False
    return True
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1], [1])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two lists as input, nums and mos.
The first loop iterates over the elements of mos and removes the corresponding elements from nums using the index method.
The second loop sorts the elements of nums in ascending order.
The third loop iterates over the elements of mos and appends them to nums.
The fourth loop iterates over the elements of nums and checks if the elements are in ascending order.
If any element is found to be greater than the next element, the function returns False.
If all elements are in ascending order, the function returns True.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1], [1], we need to remove the element 1 from the list [3, 2, 4] and append it to the end of the list [3, 2, 4, 1].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1], [1] is False.
<<<Output>>>
False
