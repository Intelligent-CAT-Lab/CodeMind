Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(dic):
    dic2 = dict(zip(dic.values(), dic.keys()))
    return dic2
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({-1: "a", 0: "b", 1: "c"})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary dic as input and returns a new dictionary dic2.
The new dictionary dic2 is created by zipping the values of the input dictionary with the keys of the input dictionary.
The resulting list of tuples is then converted back to a dictionary using the dict() constructor.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {-1: "a", 0: "b", 1: "c"}, we need to create a new dictionary with the keys and values swapped.
The keys of the input dictionary are the values of the new dictionary, and the values of the input dictionary are the keys of the new dictionary.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {-1: "a", 0: "b", 1: "c"} is {0: -1, 1: 0, 2: 1}.
<<<Output>>>
{0: -1, 1: 0, 2: 1}
