Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, limit, char):
    if limit < len(text):
        return text[0:limit]
    return text.ljust(limit, char)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('tqzym', 5, 'c')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, limit, and char.
The text parameter is a string that represents the input text.
The limit parameter is an integer that represents the maximum length of the output string.
The char parameter is a string that represents the character to use for padding the output string.

The function first checks if the length of the input text is less than the limit. If it is, then it returns the first limit characters of the input text.
If the length of the input text is greater than or equal to the limit, then it returns the input text left-justified with the specified character.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "tqzym", 5, and 'c', we need to check if the length of "tqzym" is less than 5.
Since it is not, we need to left-justify "tqzym" with the character 'c' to make it 5 characters long.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "tqzym", 5, and 'c' is "tqzymc".
<<<Output>>>
'tqzymc'
