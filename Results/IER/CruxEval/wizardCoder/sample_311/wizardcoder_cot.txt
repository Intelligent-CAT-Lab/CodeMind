Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    text = text.replace('#', '1').replace('$', '5')
    return 'yes' if text.isnumeric() else 'no'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('A')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input.
The first line of the function replaces all occurrences of the character '#' with the character '1' and all occurrences of the character '$' with the character '5'.
The second line of the function checks if the resulting string is numeric using the isnumeric() method.
If the resulting string is numeric, the function returns the string 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'no'.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'A', we need to replace all occurrences of '#' and '$' with '1' and '5', respectively. The resulting string is 'A15'. Since 'A15' is not numeric, the function returns 'no'.
<<<Output>>>
'no'
