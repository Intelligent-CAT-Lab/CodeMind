Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, ch):
    sl = s
    if ch in s:
        sl = s.lstrip(ch)
        if len(sl) == 0:
            sl = sl + '!?'
    else:
        return 'no'
    return sl
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("@@@ff", '@')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, s and ch.
The first line of the function assigns the value of s to a new variable sl.
The second line checks if ch is a substring of s. If it is, the function proceeds to the next line.
The third line removes any leading occurrences of ch from the string s using the lstrip() method.
The fourth line checks if the resulting string s is empty. If it is, the function proceeds to the next line.
The fifth line appends the string '!?' to the string s.
The sixth line returns the resulting string s.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "@@@ff" and the character '@', we need to remove any leading occurrences of '@' from the string "ff". Since the resulting string is empty, the function appends the string '!?' to the string "ff" and returns the resulting string "ff!?".

<<<Output>>>
'ff!?'
