Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, num):
    reverse = False
    if num < 0:
        reverse = True
        num *= -1
    array = array[::-1] * num
    l = len(array)
    
    if reverse:
        array = array[::-1]
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2], 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, an array and a number.
The variable reverse is initialized to False.
If the number is negative, then reverse is set to True and num is multiplied by -1.
The array is reversed and multiplied by num.
The length of the array is stored in the variable l.
If reverse is True, then the array is reversed again.
The function returns the modified array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2] and 1, we need to reverse the array twice and multiply it by 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2] and 1 is [2, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 1]
