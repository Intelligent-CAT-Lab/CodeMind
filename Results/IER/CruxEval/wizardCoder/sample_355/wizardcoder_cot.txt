Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, prefix):
    return text[len(prefix):]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('123x John z', 'z')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and prefix.
The prefix parameter is a string that is used to identify the start of the desired substring.
The text parameter is the string that contains the substring to be extracted.
The function returns the substring of text starting from the index immediately after the index of the last occurrence of the prefix string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '123x John z' and prefix 'z', we need to extract the substring 'John z' from the input string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '123x John z' and prefix 'z' is 'John z'.
<<<Output>>>
'John z'
