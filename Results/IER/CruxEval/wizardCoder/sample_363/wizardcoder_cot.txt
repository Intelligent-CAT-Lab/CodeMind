Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    new_nums = [nums[n//2]]
    
    if n % 2 == 0:
        new_nums = [nums[n//2 - 1], nums[n//2]]
    
    for i in range(0, n//2):
        new_nums.insert(0, nums[n-i-1])
        new_nums.append(nums[i])
    return new_nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The function sorts the list in ascending order using the sort() method.
The length of the sorted list is stored in the variable n.
The function creates a new list new_nums with the middle element of the sorted list.
If the length of the sorted list is even, the function creates a new list with the two middle elements of the sorted list.
The function then iterates over the sorted list from the beginning and from the end, and inserts the elements in the new_nums list in the correct order.
Finally, the function returns the new_nums list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1], we need to sort the list [1] in ascending order, which results in [1].
The length of the sorted list is 1, so the function creates a new list new_nums with the middle element of the sorted list, which is 1.
The length of the sorted list is even, so the function creates a new list with the two middle elements of the sorted list, which is [1].
The function then iterates over the sorted list from the beginning and from the end, and inserts the elements in the new_nums list in the correct order, which is [1, 1].
Finally, the function returns the new_nums list, which is [1, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 1]
