Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, changes):
    result = ''
    count = 0
    changes = list(changes)
    for char in text:
        result += char if char in 'e' else changes[count % len(changes)]
        count += (1 if char not in 'e' else 0)
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('fssnvd', 'yes')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and changes.
The text parameter is a string that represents the input text.
The changes parameter is a string that represents the characters to be replaced with.
The function initializes an empty string called result and a counter called count.
The changes parameter is converted to a list so that we can access its elements using the modulo operator.
The function iterates through each character in the text parameter.
If the character is 'e', the character is added to the result string.
If the character is not 'e', the character at the current index of the changes list is added to the result string.
The count is incremented by 1 if the character is not 'e'.
The function returns the result string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "fssnvd" and "yes", we need to replace all's' with 'y' and all 'n' with 'e'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "fssnvd" and "yes" is "fyyevd".
<<<Output>>>
'fyyevd'
