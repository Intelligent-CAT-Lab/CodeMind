Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(dict1, dict2):
    result = dict1.copy()
    result.update([(__, dict2[__]) for __ in dict2])
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'disface': 9, 'cam': 7}, {'mforce': 5})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two dictionaries as input, dict1 and dict2.
The first line creates a new dictionary called result by copying the contents of dict1.
The second line updates the result dictionary by adding the key-value pairs from dict2 to it.
The third line returns the result dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'disface': 9, 'cam': 7}, {'mforce': 5}, we need to copy the contents of {'disface': 9, 'cam': 7} into a new dictionary called result. Then we need to add the key-value pairs from {'mforce': 5} to the result dictionary.

The updated result dictionary would be {'disface': 9, 'cam': 7,'mforce': 5}.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'disface': 9, 'cam': 7}, {'mforce': 5} is {'disface': 9, 'cam': 7,'mforce': 5}.
<<<Output>>>
{'disface': 9, 'cam': 7,'mforce': 5}
