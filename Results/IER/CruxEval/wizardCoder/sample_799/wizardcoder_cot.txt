Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(st):
    if st[0] == '~':
        e = st.rjust(10,'s')
        return f(e)
    else:
        return st.rjust(10, 'n')
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('eqe-;ew22')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string st as input.
If the first character of st is '~', then the function creates a new string e by right-justifying st with 10's' characters.
The function then recursively calls itself on the new string e.
If the first character of st is not '~', then the function creates a new string e by right-justifying st with 10 'n' characters.
The function then returns the new string e.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'eqe-;ew22', we need to recursively call itself on the string 'eqe-;ew22snnnnn'.
The first character of this string is not '~', so the function creates a new string 'eqe-;ew22nnnnnn'.
The function then recursively calls itself on the new string 'eqe-;ew22nnnnnn'.
This process continues until the length of the string is 10 characters.
At this point, the function returns the string 'eqe-;ew22nnnnnn'.
The final output of executing the function f on the input 'eqe-;ew22' is 'eqe-;ew22nnnnnn'.
<<<Output>>>
'eqe-;ew22nnnnnn'
