Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, value):
    length = len(text)
    index = 0
    while length > 0:
        value = text[index] + value
        length -= 1
        index += 1
    return value
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('jao mt', 'house')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and value.
The length of the text is calculated using the len() function.
The index variable is initialized to 0.
The while loop runs until the length of the text is 0.
Inside the while loop, the value variable is updated by concatenating the current character of the text with the value variable.
The length variable is decremented by 1.
The index variable is incremented by 1.
The function returns the updated value variable after the while loop completes.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "jao mt" and "house", we need to concatenate each character of the text with the value variable in reverse order.
The first character of the text is "j", so the value variable is updated to "housej".
The second character of the text is "a", so the value variable is updated to "houseja".
The third character of the text is "o", so the value variable is updated to "housejo".
The fourth character of the text is " ", so the value variable is updated to "housejo ".
The fifth character of the text is "m", so the value variable is updated to "housejo m".
The sixth character of the text is "t", so the value variable is updated to "housejo mt".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "jao mt" and "house" is "housejo mt".
<<<Output>>>
'housejo mt'
