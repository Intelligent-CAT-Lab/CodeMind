Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    digits = []
    for num in nums:
        if (isinstance(num, str) and num.isnumeric()) or isinstance(num, int):
            digits.append(num)
    digits = list(map(int, digits))
    return digits
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([0, 6, '1', '2', 0])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers and strings as input.
The function creates an empty list called digits to store the digits from the input list.
The function iterates through each element in the input list.
If the element is a string and is numeric, or if the element is an integer, the element is appended to the digits list.
The function then converts each element in the digits list to an integer using the map function.
Finally, the function returns the digits list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, '1', '2', 0], we need to extract the digits from the input list and convert them to integers.
The digits in the input list are 0, 6, 1, 2, and 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, '1', '2', 0] is [0, 6, 1, 2, 0].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 6, 1, 2, 0]
