Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(book):
    a = book.rsplit(':', 1)
    if a[0].split(' ')[-1] == a[1].split(' ')[0]:
        return f(' '.join(a[0].split(' ')[:-1]) +'' + a[1])
    return book
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string book as input.
The string book is split into two parts using the ':' character.
The first part is assigned to variable a[0] and the second part is assigned to variable a[1].
The first part is split into two parts using the'' character.
The last word of the first part is compared with the first word of the second part.
If they are equal, the function f is called recursively with the input as the concatenation of the first part of the first part (excluding the last word) and the second part.
If they are not equal, the function f returns the original input book.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun", we need to call the function f with the input "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd erwuyawa pun".
The first part of the input "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun" is "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd".
The second part of the input "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun" is "erwuyawa pun".
The last word of the first part "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd" is "nhtnfyd".
The first word of the second part "erwuyawa pun" is "erwuyawa".
Since they are not equal, the function f returns the original input book "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun".
<<<Output>>>
'udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun'
