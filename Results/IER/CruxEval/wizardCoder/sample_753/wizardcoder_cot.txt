Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(bag):
    values = list(bag.values())
    tbl = {}
    for v in range(100):
        if v in values:
            tbl[v] = values.count(v)
    return tbl
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary bag as input and returns a dictionary tbl.
The values of the dictionary bag are converted to a list of values using the list() function.
A new dictionary tbl is created to store the count of each value in the list of values.
The for loop iterates over the range of values from 0 to 99.
If the current value v is in the list of values, its count is added to the dictionary tbl.
The final dictionary tbl is returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0}, we need to count the number of occurrences of each value in the list of values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
The values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all present in the list of values, so their counts are 1 each.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0} is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}.
<<<Output>>>
{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}
