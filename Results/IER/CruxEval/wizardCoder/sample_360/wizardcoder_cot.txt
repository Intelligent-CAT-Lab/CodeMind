Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, n):
    if len(text) <= 2:
        return text
    leading_chars = text[0] * (n - len(text) + 1)
    return leading_chars + text[1:-1] + text[-1]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('g', 15)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and n.
The first line of the function checks if the length of the input text is less than or equal to 2. If it is, then it returns the input text as it is.
If the length of the input text is greater than 2, then it creates a string of leading characters by multiplying the first character of the input text n-1 times.
The second line of the function returns the concatenation of the leading characters, the middle characters of the input text (excluding the first and last characters), and the last character of the input text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "g" and n=15, we need to concatenate the string "ggggggggggg" with the middle characters of the input text "g" (excluding the first and last characters) and the last character of the input text "g".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "g" and n=15 is "ggggggggggg".
<<<Output>>>
'ggggggggggg'
