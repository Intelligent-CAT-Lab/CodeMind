Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    count = len(nums)
    for i in range(0, count):
        nums.insert(i, nums[i]*2)
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([2, 8, -2, 9, 3, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The function initializes a variable count to the length of the input list.
The function then iterates over the indices of the input list using a for loop.
For each index i in the range [0, count), the function inserts the value of nums[i] multiplied by 2 at index i in the input list.
Finally, the function returns the modified input list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 8, -2, 9, 3, 3], we need to insert the values 4, 16, -4, 18, 6, 6 at the corresponding indices in the input list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 8, -2, 9, 3, 3] is [2, 4, -2, 9, 6, 6, 8, 16, -4, 18, 3, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 4, -2, 9, 6, 6, 8, 16, -4, 18, 3, 3]
