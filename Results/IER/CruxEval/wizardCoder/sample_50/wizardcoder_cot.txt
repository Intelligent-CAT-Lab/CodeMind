Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    lst.clear()
    lst += [1] * (len(lst) + 1)
    return lst
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['a', 'c', 'v'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and modifies it in the following way:
- It clears the list by calling the clear() method.
- It appends 1 to the list len(lst) + 1 times using the += operator.
- It returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['a', 'c', 'v'], we need to clear the list, append 1 to it len(lst) + 1 times, and return the modified list.

The modified list would be [1, 1, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1]
