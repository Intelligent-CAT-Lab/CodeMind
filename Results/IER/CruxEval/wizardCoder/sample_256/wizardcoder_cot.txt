Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, sub):
    a = 0
    b = len(text) - 1

    while a <= b:
        c = (a + b) // 2
        if text.rfind(sub) >= c:
            a = c + 1
        else:
            b = c - 1

    return a
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('dorfunctions', '2')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and sub.
The variable a is initialized to 0 and b is initialized to the length of the text minus 1.
The while loop runs until a is less than or equal to b.
Inside the while loop, the variable c is calculated as the average of a and b.
The function f uses the rfind method to find the last occurrence of the sub string in the text string.
If the last occurrence of the sub string is greater than or equal to c, then a is set to c plus 1.
Otherwise, b is set to c minus 1.
The function f returns the value of a.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "dorfunctions" and "2", we need to find the index of the last occurrence of the sub string "2" in the text string "dorfunctions".
The last occurrence of the sub string "2" in the text string "dorfunctions" is at index 5.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "dorfunctions" and "2" is 6.
<<<Output>>>6
