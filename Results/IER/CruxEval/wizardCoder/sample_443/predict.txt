What would be the return value of `f("lorem ipsum")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following operations:
1. Iterate over each character in the string text.
2. If the character is a space, remove all leading spaces from the string text using the lstrip() method.
3. If the character is not a space, replace all occurrences of the substring "cd" with the current character in the iteration using the replace() method.
4. Return the modified string text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "lorem ipsum", we need to perform the following operations:
1. Iterate over each character in the string "lorem ipsum".
2. The first character is 'l', so we don't need to do anything.
3. The second character is 'o', so we don't need to do anything.
4. The third character is 'r', so we don't need to do anything.
5. The fourth character is 'e', so we don't need to do anything.
6. The fifth character is'm', so we don't need to do anything.
7. The sixth character is a space, so we remove all leading spaces from the string "lorem ipsum" using the lstrip() method.
8. The resulting string is "orem ipsum".
9. The seventh character is 'i', so we replace all occurrences of the substring "cd" with 'i' in the string "orem ipsum" using the replace() method.
10. The resulting string is "orem ipsum".
11. The eighth character is 'p', so we replace all occurrences of the substring "cd" with 'p' in the string "orem ipsum" using the replace() method.
12. The resulting string is "orem ipsum".
13. The ninth character is's', so we replace all occurrences of the substring "cd" with's' in the string "orem ipsum" using the replace() method.
14. The resulting string is "orem ipsum".
15. The tenth character is'', so we replace all occurrences of the substring "cd" with'' in the string "orem ipsum" using the replace() method.
16. The resulting string is "orem ipsum".
17. The eleventh character is 'i', so we replace all occurrences
