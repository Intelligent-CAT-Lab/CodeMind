Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    if len(text) == 0:
        return ''
    text = text.lower()
    return text[0].upper() + text[1:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('xzd')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input.
If the length of the string is 0, the function returns an empty string.
Otherwise, the function converts the string to lowercase and returns the first character of the string capitalized and the rest of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "xzd", we need to check the length of the string.
Since the length of the string is not 0, we need to convert the string to lowercase.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "xzd" is "Xzd".
<<<Output>>>
'Xzd'
