Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    tmp = string.lower()
    for char in string.lower():
        if char in tmp:
            tmp = tmp.replace(char, '', 1)
    return tmp
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('[ Hello ]+ Hello, World!!_ Hi')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and performs the following steps:
1. Convert the input string to lowercase using the `lower()` method.
2. Create a temporary variable `tmp` and set it equal to the lowercase input string.
3. Iterate over each character in the lowercase input string.
4. If the character is present in the temporary variable `tmp`, remove it using the `replace()` method with the count parameter set to 1.
5. After iterating over all characters, return the temporary variable `tmp`.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "[ Hello ]+ Hello, World!!_ Hi", we need to perform the following steps:
1. Convert the input string to lowercase: "[ hello ]+ hello, world!!_ hi"
2. Create a temporary variable `tmp` and set it equal to the lowercase input string: "hello hello, world!!_ hi"
3. Iterate over each character in the lowercase input string:
    a. If the character is present in the temporary variable `tmp`, remove it using the `replace()` method with the count parameter set to 1: "hello, world!!_ hi"
    b. If the character is not present in the temporary variable `tmp`, do nothing.
4. After iterating over all characters, return the temporary variable `tmp`: "hello, world!!_ hi"

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "[ Hello ]+ Hello, World!!_ Hi" is "hello, world!!_ hi".
<<<Output>>>
'hello, world!!_ hi'
