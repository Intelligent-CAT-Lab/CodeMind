Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    result = []
    index = 0
    while index < len(array):
        result.append(array.pop())
        index += 2
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array that contains every other element of the input array in reverse order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8], we need to iterate through the input array and append every other element to a new array in reverse order.
The first element of the input array is 8, which is the first element of the output array.
The second element of the input array is 8, which is the second element of the output array.
The third element of the input array is -4, which is not included in the output array because it is the third element and we are only appending every other element.
The fourth element of the input array is -9, which is not included in the output array because it is the fourth element and we are only appending every other element.
The fifth element of the input array is 2, which is the fifth element of the output array.
The sixth element of the input array is 8, which is the sixth element of the output array.
The seventh element of the input array is -1, which is not included in the output array because it is the seventh element and we are only appending every other element.
The eighth element of the input array is 8, which is the eighth element of the output array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8] is [8, 8, 2, 8, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[8, 8, 2, 8, 8]
