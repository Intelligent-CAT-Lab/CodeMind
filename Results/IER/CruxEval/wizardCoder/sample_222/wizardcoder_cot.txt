Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(mess, char):
    while mess.find(char, mess.rindex(char) + 1)!= -1:
        mess = mess[:mess.rindex(char) + 1] + mess[mess.rindex(char) + 2:]
    return mess
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('0aabbaa0b', 'a')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, mess and char.
The while loop iterates until the char is not found in the mess.
Inside the loop, the function finds the last occurrence of char in the mess using the rindex() method.
Then it removes the char from the mess using slicing and concatenates the remaining mess.
The function continues to iterate until the char is not found in the mess.
Finally, the function returns the modified mess.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "0aabbaa0b" and 'a', we need to remove all the 'a's from the string.
The first 'a' is at index 1 and the last 'a' is at index 7.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "0aabbaa0b" and 'a' is "0bb0".
<<<Output>>>
'0bb0'
