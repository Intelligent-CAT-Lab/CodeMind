Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(plot, delin):
    if delin in plot:
        split = plot.index(delin)
        first = plot[:split]
        second = plot[split + 1:]
        return first + second
    else:
        return plot
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3, 4], 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, plot and delin.
The if statement checks if delin is present in plot.
If delin is present, the function splits the plot into two parts based on the index of delin.
The first part is assigned to the variable first, and the second part is assigned to the variable second.
The function then returns the concatenation of first and second.
If delin is not present, the function returns the original plot.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4], 3), we need to split the list [1, 2, 3, 4] into two parts based on the index of 3.
The first part is [1, 2, 3], and the second part is [4].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4], 3) is [1, 2, 3, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4]
