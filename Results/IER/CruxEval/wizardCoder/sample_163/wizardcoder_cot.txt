Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, space_symbol, size):
    spaces = ''.join(space_symbol for i in range(size-len(text)))
    return text + spaces
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('w', '))', 7)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, space_symbol, and size.
The text parameter is a string that represents the text to be added spaces to.
The space_symbol parameter is a string that represents the symbol to be used for the spaces.
The size parameter is an integer that represents the total length of the resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "w", ")", and 7, we need to add spaces to the text "w" to make it 7 characters long.
The space_symbol parameter is ")", so we will use that symbol for the spaces.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "w", ")", and 7 is "w    )".
<<<Output>>>
'w    )'
