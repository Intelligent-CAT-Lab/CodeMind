Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    length = len(text)
    index = -1
    for i in range(length):
        if text[i] == char:
            index = i
    if index == -1:
        index = length // 2
    new_text = list(text)
    new_text.pop(index)
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('o horseto', 'r')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and char.
The length of the input text is calculated using the len() function.
The index of the last occurrence of the character char in the input text is initialized to -1.
The for loop iterates over the indices of the characters in the input text.
If the character at the current index is equal to the character char, the index is updated to the current index.
If the index is still -1, it means that the character char was not found in the input text.
In this case, the index is set to the middle index of the input text.
The new_text variable is initialized as a list of characters in the input text.
The pop() method is used to remove the character at the index position from the new_text list.
Finally, the new_text list is converted back to a string using the ''.join() method and returned as the output of the function.
<<<Output>>>The return value of the code for the input 'o horseto' and character 'r' is 'o hsesto'.
