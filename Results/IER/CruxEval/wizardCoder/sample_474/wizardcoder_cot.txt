Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(txt, marker):
    a = []
    lines = txt.split('\n')
    for line in lines:
        a.append(line.center(marker))
    return '\n'.join(a)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('#[)[]>[^e>\n 8', -5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, txt and marker.
The txt parameter is a string that contains multiple lines of text.
The marker parameter is an integer that specifies the width of the centered text.

The function first initializes an empty list a.
Then it splits the txt string into a list of lines using the split() method.
Next, it loops through each line in the list and appends the centered version of the line to the a list using the append() method.
Finally, it joins the elements of the a list into a single string using the join() method and returns the resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "#[)[]>[^e>\n 8", -5), we need to center each line of the input string with a marker width of -5.

The first line of the input string is "#[)[]>".
The centered version of this line with a marker width of -5 is "  #[)[]>".
The second line of the input string is "^e>".
The centered version of this line with a marker width of -5 is " ^e>".
The third line of the input string is "\n 8".
The centered version of this line with a marker width of -5 is " \n 8".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "#[)[]>[^e>\n 8", -5) is:

```
  #[)[]>
 ^e>
 \n 8
```

<<<Output>>>
```
  #[)[]>
 ^e>
 \n 8
```
