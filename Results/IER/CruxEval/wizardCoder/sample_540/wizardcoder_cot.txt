Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a):
    b = a.copy()
    for k in range(0, len(a) - 1, 2):
        b.insert(k + 1, b[k])
    b.append(b[0])
    return b
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list a as input and returns a new list b.
The new list b is a copy of the input list a.
The function then iterates over the even indices of the input list a and swaps the corresponding elements in the new list b.
Finally, the function appends the first element of the input list a to the end of the new list b.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9], we need to perform the following steps:
1. Create a copy of the input list [5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9] to create the new list b.
2. Iterate over the even indices of the input list [5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9] and swap the corresponding elements in the new list b.
3. Append the first element of the input list [5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9] to the end of the new list b.
4. Return the new list b.
The resulting new list b is [5, 5, 6, 5, 4, 9].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 5, 6, 5, 4, 9]
