Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, position):
    length = len(text)
    index = position % (length + 1)
    if position < 0 or index < 0:
        index = -1
    new_text = list(text)
    new_text.pop(index)
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('undbs l', 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and position.
The length of the text is calculated using the len() function.
The index is calculated by taking the modulus of position with the length of the text plus 1.
If the position is negative or the index is negative, the index is set to -1.
The new_text is created by converting the text to a list and removing the character at the index position.
The new_text is then converted back to a string using the ''.join() function.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "undbs l" and position 1, we need to remove the character at index 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "undbs l" and position 1 is "undbsl".
<<<Output>>>
'undbsl'
