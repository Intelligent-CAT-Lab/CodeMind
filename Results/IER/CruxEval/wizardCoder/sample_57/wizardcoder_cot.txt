Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    text = text.upper()
    count_upper = 0
    for char in text:
        if char.isupper():
            count_upper += 1
        else:
            return 'no'
    return count_upper // 2
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ax')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input.
The first line of the function converts the string to uppercase using the upper() method.
The second line initializes a variable count_upper to 0.
The third line iterates through each character in the string using a for loop.
The fourth line checks if the current character is uppercase using the isupper() method.
If the current character is uppercase, the count_upper variable is incremented by 1.
If the current character is not uppercase, the function returns the string 'no'.
Finally, the function returns the value of count_upper divided by 2.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ax', we need to convert 'ax' to uppercase, count the number of uppercase characters, and divide the count by 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ax' is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
