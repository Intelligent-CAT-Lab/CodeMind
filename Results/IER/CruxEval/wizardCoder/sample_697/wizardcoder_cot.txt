Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, sep):
    sep_index = s.find(sep)
    prefix = s[:sep_index]
    middle = s[sep_index:sep_index + len(sep)]
    right_str = s[sep_index + len(sep):]
    return prefix, middle, right_str
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("not it", "")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, s and sep.
The sep argument is used to find the index of the separator in the string s.
If the separator is not found, sep_index will be -1.
If sep_index is -1, the function will return a tuple of three empty strings.
If sep_index is not -1, the function will return a tuple of three strings:
- The prefix of s up to the separator, which is s[:sep_index]
- The separator itself, which is s[sep_index:sep_index + len(sep)]
- The suffix of s after the separator, which is s[sep_index + len(sep):]

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "not it", we need to find the index of the separator in the string "not it".
The separator is an empty string, so the index will be 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "not it" is:
- The prefix of "not it" up to the separator, which is "not"
- The separator itself, which is ""
- The suffix of "not it" after the separator, which is " it"

<<<Output>>>
('not', '','it')
