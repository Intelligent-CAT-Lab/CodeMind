Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    b = list(str(n))
    for i in range(2,len(b)): b[i] += '+'
    return b
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(44)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer n as input and returns a list of strings representing the digits of n.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 44, we need to convert 44 to a string "44" and then split it into a list of digits.
The list of digits will be [4, 4].
Next, we need to iterate over the list of digits and add the string "+" to each digit except the first one.
The modified list of digits will be [4, 4, '+'].
Finally, we need to convert the modified list of digits back to a string and split it into a list of strings representing the digits.
The output of executing the function f on the input 44 will be ['4', '4', '+'].
<<<Output>>>
['4', '4', '+']
