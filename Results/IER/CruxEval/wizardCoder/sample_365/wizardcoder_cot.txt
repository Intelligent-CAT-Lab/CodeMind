Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n, s):
    if s.startswith(n):
        pre, _ = s.split(n, 1)
        return pre + n + s[len(n):]
    return s
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('xqc','mRcwVqXsRDRb')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, n and s.
The if statement checks if s starts with n.
If it does, it splits s into two parts using n as the separator.
The first part is assigned to the variable pre and the second part is assigned to the variable _ (which is not used).
The function then returns the concatenation of pre, n, and the second part of s (which is s[len(n):]).
If s does not start with n, the function returns s as is.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "xqc" and "mRcwVqXsRDRb", we need to check if "mRcwVqXsRDRb" starts with "xqc".
Since it does, we split "mRcwVqXsRDRb" into two parts using "xqc" as the separator.
The first part is "mRcwVqX" and the second part is "sRDRb".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "xqc" and "mRcwVqXsRDRb" is "mRcwVqXxcRDRb".
<<<Output>>>
'mRcwVqXxcRDRb'
