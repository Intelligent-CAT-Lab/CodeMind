Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    string_a, string_b = text.split(',')
    return -(len(string_a) + (len(string_b)))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('dog,cat')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and splits it into two strings, string_a and string_b, using the comma as the separator.
The function then calculates the difference between the lengths of string_a and string_b, and returns the negative of that value.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "dog,cat", we need to split the input into "dog" and "cat", and then calculate the difference between their lengths.
The length of "dog" is 3, and the length of "cat" is 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "dog,cat" is -6.
<<<Output>>>
-6
