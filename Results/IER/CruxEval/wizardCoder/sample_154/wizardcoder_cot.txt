Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, c):
    s = s.split(' ')
    return ((c + "  ") + ("  ".join(s[::-1])))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Hello There', '*')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, s and c.
The first line of the function splits the string s into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter.
The second line of the function concatenates the string c with two spaces and then joins the list of words in reverse order using two spaces as the delimiter.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Hello There" and the character "*", we need to split the string "Hello There" into a list of words, reverse the order of the list, and then concatenate the character "*" with two spaces and the reversed list of words.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "Hello There" and the character "*" is "*  There   ello".
<<<Output>>>
'*  There   ello'
