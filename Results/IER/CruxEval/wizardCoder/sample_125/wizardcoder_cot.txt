Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, res):
    for c in '*\n"':
        text = text.replace(c, '!' + str(res))
    if text.startswith('!'):
        text = text[len(str(res)):]
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('"Leap and the net will appear', 123)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and res.
The first line of the function replaces all occurrences of the characters '*', '\n', and '"' with the string '!' + str(res).
The second line of the function checks if the text starts with '!', and if it does, it removes the first len(str(res)) characters from the text.
The third line of the function returns the modified text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '"Leap and the net will appear', 123', we need to replace all occurrences of '*', '\n', and '"' with '!' + str(123), which gives us '!123'.
The second line of the function checks if '!123' starts with '!', which it does, so it removes the first 3 characters from '!123', giving us '123'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '"Leap and the net will appear', 123' is '123'.
<<<Output>>>
'123'
