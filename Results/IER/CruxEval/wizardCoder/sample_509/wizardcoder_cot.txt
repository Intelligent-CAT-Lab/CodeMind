Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(value, width):
    if value >= 0:
        return str(value).zfill(width)

    if value < 0:
        return '-' + str(-value).zfill(width)
    return ''
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(5, 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, value and width.
The first if statement checks if the value is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it returns the string representation of the value with leading zeros added to the left to make it the specified width.
The second if statement checks if the value is less than 0. If it is, it returns the string representation of the absolute value of the value with leading zeros added to the left to make it the specified width, followed by a minus sign.
The third if statement handles the case where the value is 0. It returns an empty string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (5, 1), we need to check the first if statement. Since 5 is greater than or equal to 0, we need to return the string representation of 5 with leading zeros added to the left to make it 1 character wide. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (5, 1) is "5".
<<<Output>>>
'5'
