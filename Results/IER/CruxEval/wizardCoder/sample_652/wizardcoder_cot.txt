Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    if not string or not string[0].isnumeric:
        return 'INVALID'
    cur = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        cur = cur * 10 + int(string[i])
    return str(cur)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('3')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and checks if the string is empty or if its first character is not a numeric digit. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns 'INVALID'.
If the string is not empty and its first character is a numeric digit, the function iterates through the string and calculates the numerical value of the string.
The numerical value is then returned as a string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '3', we need to check if the string is empty or if its first character is not a numeric digit. Since the string is not empty and its first character is a numeric digit, we proceed to calculate the numerical value of the string.
The numerical value of the string '3' is 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '3' is '3'.
<<<Output>>>
'3'
