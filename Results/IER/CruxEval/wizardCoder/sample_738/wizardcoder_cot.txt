Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, characters):
    for i in range(len(characters)):
        text = text.rstrip(characters[i::len(characters)])
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r", "x.r")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, text and characters.
The text argument is a string that we want to remove characters from.
The characters argument is a string that contains the characters we want to remove from the text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r" and "x.r", we need to remove all the characters in the "x.r" string from the "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r" string.

We can remove the characters in the "x.r" string from the "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r" string by iterating over the characters in the "x.r" string and using the rstrip() method to remove all occurrences of the characters in the "x.r" string from the right side of the "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r" string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r" and "x.r" is "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r".
<<<Output>>>
'r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r'
