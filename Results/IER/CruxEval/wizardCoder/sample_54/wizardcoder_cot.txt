Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, s, e):
    sublist = text[s:e]
    if not sublist:
        return -1
    return sublist.index(min(sublist))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('happy', 0, 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, s, and e.
The parameter text is a string that represents the input text.
The parameter s is an integer that represents the starting index of the sublist.
The parameter e is an integer that represents the ending index of the sublist.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "happy", 0, and 3, we need to extract the sublist "app" from the input text.
The sublist "app" has a minimum value of "a", which is at index 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "happy", 0, and 3 is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
