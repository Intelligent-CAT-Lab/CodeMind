Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(test, sep, maxsplit):
    try:
        return test.rsplit(sep, maxsplit)
    except:
        return test.rsplit()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ab cd', 'x', 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: test, sep, and maxsplit.
The parameter test is a string that we want to split.
The parameter sep is the separator that we want to use to split the string.
The parameter maxsplit is the maximum number of splits to do.

The function f tries to split the string test using the separator sep and the maximum number of splits maxsplit.
If the split is successful, it returns the resulting list of substrings.
If the split is not successful, it returns the original string test.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "ab cd" using the separator "x" and a maximum of 2 splits, we need to split the string "ab cd" using the separator "x" and a maximum of 2 splits.

The resulting list of substrings is ['ab', 'cd'].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "ab cd" using the separator "x" and a maximum of 2 splits is ['ab', 'cd'].
<<<Output>>>
['ab', 'cd']
