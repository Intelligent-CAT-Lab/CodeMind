Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    a = 0
    for i in x.split(' '):
        a += len(i.zfill(len(i)*2))
    return a
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('999893767522480')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string x as input and returns the sum of the lengths of the zero-padded strings obtained by splitting x into words and then zero-padding each word to twice its length.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "999893767522480", we need to split the input into words and then zero-pad each word to twice its length.
The words in the input are "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480".
The zero-padded strings obtained by splitting each word in the input into words and then zero-padding each word to twice its length are:
"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
