What would be the return value of `f('999893767522480')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string x as input and returns the sum of the lengths of the zero-padded strings obtained by splitting x into words and then zero-padding each word to twice its length.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "999893767522480", we need to split the input into words and then zero-pad each word to twice its length.
The words in the input are "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480", "999893767522480".
The zero-padded strings obtained by splitting each word in the input into words and then zero-padding each word to twice its length are:
"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
