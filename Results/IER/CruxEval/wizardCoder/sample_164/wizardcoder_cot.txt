Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return lst[0:3]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, 8, 1, 3, 0])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and sorts it in ascending order. It then returns the first three elements of the sorted list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 1, 3, 0], we need to sort the list [5, 8, 1, 3, 0] in ascending order. After sorting, the sorted list is [0, 1, 3, 5, 8].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 1, 3, 0] is [0, 1, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 3]
