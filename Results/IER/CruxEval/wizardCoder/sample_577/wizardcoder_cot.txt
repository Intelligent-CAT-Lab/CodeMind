Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(items):
    result = []
    for number in items:
        d = dict(items).copy()
        d.popitem()
        result.append(d)
        items = d
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([(1, 'pos')])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of tuples as input and returns a list of dictionaries.
The list of tuples [(1, 'pos')] contains one tuple with the elements (1, 'pos').
The first step of the function is to initialize an empty list called result.
The second step is to iterate over each tuple in the input list.
For each tuple, the function creates a new dictionary by copying the input list of tuples.
The popitem() method is used to remove the last item from the dictionary.
The resulting dictionary is appended to the result list.
The input list of tuples is updated to be the resulting dictionary.
The loop continues until all tuples have been processed.
The final result is the list of dictionaries.
<<<Output>>>
[{1: 'pos'}]
