Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(price, product):
    inventory = ['olives', 'key', 'orange']
    if product not in inventory:
        return price
    else:
        price *=.85
        inventory.remove(product)
    return price
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(8.50, 'grapes')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, price and product.
The inventory list contains three items: 'olives', 'key', and 'orange'.
The if statement checks if the product is not in the inventory list.
If the product is not in the inventory list, the function returns the original price.
If the product is in the inventory list, the price is multiplied by 0.85 and the product is removed from the inventory list.
The function returns the updated price.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (8.50, 'grapes'), we need to check if 'grapes' is in the inventory list.
'grapes' is not in the inventory list, so the function returns the original price of 8.50.
<<<Output>>>
8.50
