Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, elem):
    if elem!= '':
        while text.startswith(elem):
            text = text.replace(elem, '')
        while elem.startswith(text):
            elem = elem.replace(text, '')
    return [elem, text]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("some", "1")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and elem.
The first if statement checks if elem is not an empty string. If it is not empty, it enters a while loop that removes all occurrences of elem from the beginning of text.
The second while loop removes all occurrences of text from the beginning of elem.
Finally, the function returns a list containing elem and text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "some" and "1", we need to remove all occurrences of "1" from the beginning of "some".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "some" and "1" is ["", "some"].
<<<Output>>>
['','some']
