Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, value):
    left, _, right = text.partition(value)
    return right + left
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('difkj rinpx', 'k')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and value.
The partition method of the string class is used to split the text into three parts based on the value.
The left part is the part of the string before the value, the middle part is the value itself, and the right part is the part of the string after the value.
The function returns the concatenation of the right part and the left part.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "difkj rinpx" and "k", we need to split the text into three parts based on the value "k".
The left part is "difkj ri", the middle part is "k", and the right part is "px".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "difkj rinpx" and "k" is "pxdifkj ri".
<<<Output>>>
'pxdifkj ri'
