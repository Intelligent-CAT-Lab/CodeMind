Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    lst.clear()
    for i in lst:
        if i == 3:
            return False
    else:
        return True
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([2, 0])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and clears the list. Then it iterates through the list and checks if the element is equal to 3. If it finds 3, it returns False. If it reaches the end of the list without finding 3, it returns True.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 0], we need to clear the list and then iterate through it. Since the list is empty, the function will return True.
<<<Output>>>
True
