Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(pattern, items):
    result = []
    for text in items:
        pos = text.rfind(pattern)
        if pos >= 0:
            result.append(pos)

    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(" B ", [" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, pattern and items.
The pattern is a string that we want to search for in the items.
The items is a list of strings that we want to search in.

The function initializes an empty list called result.

The function iterates through each string in the items list.
For each string, the function finds the last occurrence of the pattern in the string using the rfind() method.
If the pattern is found, the function appends the position of the pattern in the string to the result list.

Finally, the function returns the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input " B ", [" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"], we need to search for the pattern " B " in each string in the items list.

The first string in the items list is " bBb ".
The pattern " B " is found at the end of the string, so the function appends 2 to the result list.

The second string in the items list is " BaB ".
The pattern " B " is found at the beginning of the string, so the function appends 0 to the result list.

The third string in the items list is " bB".
The pattern " B " is found at the beginning of the string, so the function appends 0 to the result list.

The fourth string in the items list is " bBbB ".
The pattern " B " is found at the beginning of the string, so the function appends 0 to the result list.

The fifth string in the items list is " bbb".
The pattern " B " is not found in the string, so the function does not append anything to the result list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input " B ", [" bBb ", " BaB ", " bB", " bBbB ", " bbb"] is [2, 0, 0, 0].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 0, 0, 0]
