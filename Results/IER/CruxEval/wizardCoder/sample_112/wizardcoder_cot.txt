Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(sentence):
    ls = list(sentence)
    for letter in ls:
        if not letter.istitle():
            ls.remove(letter)
    return ''.join(ls)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('XYZ LittleRedRidingHood LiTTleBIGGeXEiT fault')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string sentence as input and returns a new string with all the uppercase letters removed from the original string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "XYZ LittleRedRidingHood LiTTleBIGGeXEiT fault", we need to remove all the uppercase letters from the string.
First, we convert the input string to a list of characters using the list() function.
Next, we iterate over each character in the list and check if it is uppercase using the istitle() method.
If the character is not uppercase, we remove it from the list using the remove() method.
Finally, we join the remaining characters in the list back into a string using the ''.join() method and return the resulting string.
<<<Output>>>
'XYZ littleRedRidingHood littlebiggxeit fault'
