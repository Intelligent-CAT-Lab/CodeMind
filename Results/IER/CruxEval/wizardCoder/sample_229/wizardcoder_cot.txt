Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(dic, value):
    result = []
    for e in dic:
        result.append(e[0])
        if e[1] == value:
            result.reverse()
        else:
            result.append(e[1])
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'9m':2,'mA':1, '10K':2, 'Lk':2}, 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary dic and a value value as input.
The function creates an empty list result to store the output.
The function iterates through each key-value pair in the dictionary dic.
For each key-value pair, the function appends the first element of the pair (i.e., the key) to the result list.
If the second element of the pair (i.e., the value) is equal to the input value, the function reverses the order of the result list.
Otherwise, the function appends the second element of the pair to the result list.
Finally, the function returns the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'9m':2,'mA':1, '10K':2, 'Lk':2}, 1), we need to append the keys '9m','mA', and 'Lk' to the result list, and then reverse the order of the result list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'9m':2,'mA':1, '10K':2, 'Lk':2}, 1) is ['9m','mA', 'Lk'].
<<<Output>>>
['9m','mA', 'Lk']
