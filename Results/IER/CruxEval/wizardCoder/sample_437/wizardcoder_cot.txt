Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(tap_hierarchy):
    hierarchy = {}
    for gift in tap_hierarchy:
        hierarchy = hierarchy.fromkeys(gift, None)
    return hierarchy
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['john', 'doe', 'the', 'john', 'doe'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns a dictionary.
The dictionary is initialized as an empty dictionary.
The for loop iterates over each string in the input list.
For each string, the function creates a new key in the dictionary with the value None.
The function returns the final dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['john', 'doe', 'the', 'john', 'doe'], we need to create a dictionary with keys 'john', 'doe', 'the', and 'john', and values None.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['john', 'doe', 'the', 'john', 'doe'] is {'john': None, 'doe': None, 'the': None, 'john': None}.
<<<Output>>>
{'john': None, 'doe': None, 'the': None, 'john': None}
