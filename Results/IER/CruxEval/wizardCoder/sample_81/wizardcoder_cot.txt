Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(dic, inx):
    try:
        dic[list(dic)[list(dic).index(inx)]] = list(dic)[list(dic).index(inx)].lower()
    except ValueError:
        pass
    return list(dic.items())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({"Bulls": 23, "White Sox": 45}, "Bulls")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary dic and an index inx as input.
The function tries to access the value of the key inx in the dictionary dic.
If the key is not found, a ValueError is raised.
If the key is found, the value corresponding to the key is converted to lowercase.
Finally, the function returns a list of key-value pairs in the dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {"Bulls": 23, "White Sox": 45}, "Bulls", we need to access the value of the key "Bulls" in the dictionary and convert it to lowercase.
The value of the key "Bulls" is 23, so the output of executing the function f on the input {"Bulls": 23, "White Sox": 45}, "Bulls" is [(23, 'bulls'), (45, 'white sox')].
<<<Output>>>
[(23, 'bulls'), (45, 'white sox')]
