Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
field = 0

def f(text):
    global g, field
    field = text.replace(' ', '')
    g = text.replace('0','')
    text = text.replace('1', 'i')

    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following operations:
- It replaces all spaces in the string with an empty string.
- It replaces all '0' characters in the string with a space character.
- It replaces all '1' characters in the string with the character 'i'.
- It assigns the modified string to the variable 'text'.
- It assigns the modified string without spaces to the global variable 'g'.
- It assigns the modified string without spaces to the global variable 'field'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110", we need to perform the following operations:
- Replace all spaces in the string with an empty string: "000000000000011011000110010101101110"
- Replace all '0' characters in the string with a space character: "00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110"
- Replace all '1' characters in the string with the character 'i': "00000000 00000000 i1101100 i1100101 i1101110"
- Assign the modified string to the variable 'text': "00000000 00000000 i1101100 i1100101 i1101110"
- Assign the modified string without spaces to the global variable 'g': "000000000000011011000110010101101110"
- Assign the modified string without spaces to the global variable 'field': "00000000000001101100011001
