Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(list, operation):
    new_list = list[:]
    new_list.sort()
    operation(new_list)
    return list
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([6, 4, 2, 8, 15], (lambda x: x.reverse()))`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list and an operation.
The list argument is assigned to a new list called new_list using slicing.
The new_list is sorted in ascending order.
The operation argument is a lambda function that reverses the new_list.
The lambda function is executed on the new_list.
Finally, the original list is returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 4, 2, 8, 15], (lambda x: x.reverse()), we need to first create a new list [6, 4, 2, 8, 15] using slicing. Then sort the new list in ascending order. Next, execute the lambda function (lambda x: x.reverse()) on the new list to reverse the order of the elements. Finally, return the original list [6, 4, 2, 8, 15].

The output of executing the function f on the input [6, 4, 2, 8, 15], (lambda x: x.reverse()) is [15, 8, 6, 4, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[15, 8, 6, 4, 2]
