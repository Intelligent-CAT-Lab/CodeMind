Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    d = {}
    for char in text.replace('-', '').lower():
        d[char] = d[char] + 1 if char in d else 1
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    return [val for i, val in d]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("x--y-z-5-C")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a list of characters sorted by their frequency in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "x--y-z-5-C", we need to count the frequency of each character in the string.
The string "x--y-z-5-C" is first cleaned by removing all dashes and converting all characters to lowercase.
The cleaned string is then iterated over and each character is added to a dictionary with its frequency as the value.
The dictionary is then sorted by the frequency of each character in descending order.
Finally, the sorted list of characters is returned.
<<<Output>>>
['c', 'x', 'y', 'z', '5']
