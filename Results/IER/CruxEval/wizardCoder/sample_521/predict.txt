What would be the return value of `f([43, 0, 4, 77, 5, 2, 0, 9, 77])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The maximum value of the list nums is 77.
We need to reverse the list nums for each integer i in the range of 0 to 77.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [43, 0, 4, 77, 5, 2, 0, 9, 77] is [77, 77, 77, 77, 77, 77, 77, 77, 77, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43
