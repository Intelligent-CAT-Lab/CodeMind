Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text1, text2):
    nums = []
    for i in range(len(text2)):
        nums.append(text1.count(text2[i]))
    return sum(nums)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('jivespdcxc','sx')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, text1 and text2.
The function creates an empty list nums.
The function loops through each character in text2 using a for loop.
For each character, the function appends the count of that character in text1 to the nums list.
Finally, the function returns the sum of the nums list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "jivespdcxc" and "sx", we need to count the number of occurrences of each character in "sx" in "jivespdcxc".
The character's' appears 2 times in "jivespdcxc", so we append 2 to the nums list.
The character 'x' appears 1 time in "jivespdcxc", so we append 1 to the nums list.
The function returns the sum of the nums list, which is 3.

<<<Output>>>
3
