Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    nums = ''.join(filter(lambda c:c.isdecimal(), s))
    if nums == '': return 'none'
    m = max([int(num) for num in nums.split(',')])
    return str(m)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('01,001')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input.
First, we use the filter() function to extract all the decimal digits from the input string s.
Then, we join the resulting list of digits into a single string using the join() method.
Next, we check if the resulting string is empty. If it is, we return the string "none".
Otherwise, we split the string of digits into a list of integers using the split() method.
Finally, we find the maximum integer in the list using the max() function and return it as a string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "01,001", we need to extract the decimal digits from the string "01,001" and concatenate them into a single string. Then, we split the resulting string into a list of integers and find the maximum integer. Since the maximum integer in the list is 1001, the output of executing the function f on the input "01,001" is "1001".
<<<Output>>>
'1001'
