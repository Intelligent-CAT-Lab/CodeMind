Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    values = text.split()
    return '${first}y, ${second}x, ${third}r, ${fourth}p' % dict({
        'first': values[0],
       'second': values[1],
        'third': values[2],
        'fourth': values[3]
    })
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('python ruby c javascript')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and splits it into a list of words.
The list of words is then used to create a string with the format '${first}y, ${second}x, ${third}r, ${fourth}p'.
The string is formatted using the values of the first, second, third, and fourth words of the list of words.
The resulting string is then returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'python ruby c javascript', we need to split the input string into a list of words.
The list of words is ['python', 'ruby', 'c', 'javascript'].
We then create a string with the format '${first}y, ${second}x, ${third}r, ${fourth}p' and format it using the values of the first, second, third, and fourth words of the list of words.
The resulting string is '${python}y, ${ruby}x, ${c}r, ${javascript}p'.

The output of executing the function f on the input 'python ruby c javascript' is '${python}y, ${ruby}x, ${c}r, ${javascript}p'.
<<<Output>>>
'${python}y, ${ruby}x, ${c}r, ${javascript}p'
