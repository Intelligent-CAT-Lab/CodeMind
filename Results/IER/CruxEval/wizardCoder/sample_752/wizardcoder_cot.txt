Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, amount):
    return (amount - len(s)) * 'z' + s
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('abc', 8)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, s and amount.
The first line of the function calculates the difference between amount and the length of s.
The second line of the function multiplies the result of the first line by the string 'z'.
The third line of the function concatenates the result of the second line with s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'abc' and amount 8, we need to calculate the difference between 8 and 3, which is 5.
The result of the first line is 5.
The result of the second line is 'zzzzz'.
The result of the third line is 'zzzzzabc'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'abc' and amount 8 is 'zzzzzabc'.
<<<Output>>>
'zzzzzabc'
