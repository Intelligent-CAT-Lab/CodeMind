Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, from_c, to_c):
    table = s.maketrans(from_c, to_c)
    return s.translate(table)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('aphid', 'i', '?')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: s, from_c, and to_c.
The first argument s is a string that we want to translate.
The second argument from_c is a string that represents the characters we want to replace.
The third argument to_c is a string that represents the characters we want to replace the from_c characters with.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "aphid", "i", and "?":
1. We create a translation table using the maketrans method of the string s.
2. We pass the translation table to the translate method of the string s.
3. The translate method replaces all occurrences of characters in the from_c string with the corresponding characters in the to_c string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "aphid", "i", and "?" is "ap?d".
<<<Output>>>
'ap?d'
