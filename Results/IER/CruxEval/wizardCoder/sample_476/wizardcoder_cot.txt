Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, split_on):
    t = a.split()
    a = []
    for i in t:
        for j in i:
            a.append(j)
    if split_on in a:
        return True
    else:
        return False
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("booty boot-boot bootclass", 'k')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a and split_on.
The first line of the function splits the input string a into a list of words using the split() method.
The second line initializes an empty list a.
The third line iterates over each word in the list t and appends each character to the list a.
The fourth line checks if the string split_on is present in the list a.
If it is present, the function returns True.
If it is not present, the function returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "booty boot-boot bootclass" and the argument 'k', we need to split the input string into a list of words and then iterate over each word to append its characters to a list. Finally, we check if the string 'k' is present in the list a. Since 'k' is not present in the list a, the function returns False.

<<<Output>>>
False
