Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n, array):
    final = [array.copy()] 
    for i in range(n):
        arr = array.copy()
        arr.extend(final[-1])
        final.append(arr)
    return final
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(1, [1, 2, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, n and array.
The first line of the function creates a list called final and initializes it with a copy of the input array.
The second line of the function uses a for loop to iterate n times.
Inside the for loop, the function creates a copy of the input array and extends it with the last element of the final list.
The resulting array is then appended to the final list.
Finally, the function returns the final list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (1, [1, 2, 3]), we need to call the function with the arguments (1, [1, 2, 3]).
The first line of the function creates a copy of the input array and initializes it as the first element of the final list.
The second line of the function extends the first element of the final list with the input array.
The resulting array is then appended to the final list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (1, [1, 2, 3]) is [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]].
<<<Output>>>
[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]]
