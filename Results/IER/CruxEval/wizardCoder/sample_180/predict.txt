What would be the return value of `f([-1, 5, 3, -2, -6, 8, 8])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The variable a is initialized to -1.
The variable b is initialized to a slice of nums starting from index 1.
The while loop runs until a is greater than or equal to the first element of b.
Inside the while loop, the first element of b is removed from nums using the remove() method.
The variable a is set to 0.
The variable b is set to a slice of b starting from index 1.
The while loop continues until a is greater than or equal to the first element of b.
Finally, the function returns the modified list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 5, 3, -2, -6, 8, 8], we need to remove the negative numbers from the list.
The first element of the list is -1, which is less than the first element of the slice b[1:], which is 5.
The first element of b is removed from nums using the remove() method.
The variable a is set to 0.
The variable b is set to a slice of b starting from index 1, which is [5, 3, -2, -6, 8, 8].
The while loop continues until a is greater than or equal to the first element of b, which is 5.
The first element of b is removed from nums using the remove() method.
The variable a is set to 0.
The variable b is set to a slice of b starting from index 1, which is [3, -2, -6, 8, 8].
The while loop continues until a is greater than or equal to the first element of b, which is 3.
The first element of b is removed from nums using the remove() method.
The variable a is set to 0.
The variable b is set to a slice of b starting from index 1, which is [-2, -6, 8, 8].
The while loop continues until a is greater than or equal to the first element of b, which is -2.
The first element of b is removed from nums using the remove() method.
The variable a is set to 0.
The variable b is set to a slice of
