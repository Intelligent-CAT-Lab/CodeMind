Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, value):
    return text.removeprefix(value.lower())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('coscifysu', 'cos')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and value.
The first parameter, text, is a string that we want to remove the prefix of the second parameter, value.
The second parameter, value, is a string that we want to remove the prefix of the first parameter, text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "coscifysu" and "cos", we need to remove the prefix "cos" from the string "coscifysu".

The removeprefix() method is used to remove the prefix of a string. It takes a prefix as an argument and returns the string with the prefix removed.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "coscifysu" and "cos" is "cifysu".
<<<Output>>>
'cifysu'
