Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(fruits):
    if fruits[-1] == fruits[0]:
        return 'no'
    else:
        fruits.pop(0)
        fruits.pop()
        fruits.pop(0)
        fruits.pop()
        return fruits
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['apple', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'pear', 'orange', 'orange'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of fruits as input.
The first if statement checks if the last element of the list is the same as the first element. If it is, the function returns the string 'no'.
If the last element is not the same as the first element, the function proceeds to the next line of code.
The next line of code uses the pop() method to remove the first and last elements of the list.
The third and fourth lines of code use the pop() method again to remove the first and last elements of the list.
Finally, the function returns the modified list of fruits.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['apple', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'pear', 'orange', 'orange'], we need to remove the first and last elements of the list and return the modified list.

The modified list of fruits after removing the first and last elements is ['pear', 'banana', 'pear', 'orange'].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['apple', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'pear', 'orange', 'orange'] is ['pear', 'banana', 'pear', 'orange'].
<<<Output>>>['pear', 'banana', 'pear', 'orange']
