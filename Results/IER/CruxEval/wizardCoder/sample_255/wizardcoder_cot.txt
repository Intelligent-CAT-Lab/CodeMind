Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, fill, size):
    if size < 0:
        size = -size
    if len(text) > size:
        return text[len(text) - size:]
    return text.rjust(size, fill)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('no asw', 'j', 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, fill, and size.
The first if statement checks if size is negative. If it is, it sets size to its absolute value.
The second if statement checks if the length of text is greater than size. If it is, it returns the last size characters of text.
If the length of text is not greater than size, it returns text right-justified with fill characters to make the length of the string equal to size.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "no asw", 'j', and 1, we need to check the first if statement. Since size is positive, it is not affected by the first if statement.
Then, we check the second if statement. Since the length of "no asw" is not greater than 1, it is not affected by the second if statement.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "no asw", 'j', and 1 is "no asw".
<<<Output>>>
'no asw'
