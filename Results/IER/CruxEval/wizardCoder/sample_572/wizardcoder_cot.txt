Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(data, num):
    new_dict = {}
    temp = list(data.items())
    for i in range(len(temp) - 1, num - 1, -1):
        new_dict[temp[i]] = None
    return temp[num:] + list(new_dict.items())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1}, 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, data and num.
The data argument is a dictionary with integer keys and integer values.
The num argument is an integer that specifies the index of the last element to be included in the output.

The function creates a new empty dictionary new_dict.
It then converts the dictionary data to a list of tuples using the items() method.
It then iterates over the list of tuples in reverse order using a for loop and the range function.
For each tuple, it adds the tuple to the new_dict with the key as the first element of the tuple and the value as None.

Finally, the function returns a list that contains the elements of the list of tuples that come after the num-th element in the original list of tuples.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1}, 1), we need to create a new dictionary new_dict with the key-value pairs {3: None}.
The list of tuples that comes after the 1-th element in the original list of tuples is [{2: 10}].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1}, 1) is [{2: 10}, {3: None}].
<<<Output>>>
[{2: 10}, {3: None}]
