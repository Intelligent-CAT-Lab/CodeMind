Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    new_text = text
    a = []
    while char in new_text:
        a.append(new_text.index(char))
        new_text = new_text.replace(char,"",1)
    return a
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('rvr', 'r')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and char.
The function creates a new string new_text which is a copy of the input text.
The function creates an empty list a.
The function loops through the new_text string and checks if the char is present in the string.
If the char is present, the function appends the index of the char in the new_text string to the list a.
The function then replaces the first occurrence of the char in the new_text string with an empty string.
Finally, the function returns the list a.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "rvr" and 'r', we need to loop through the string "rvr" and append the index of the character 'r' to the list a.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "rvr" and 'r' is [2].
<<<Output>>>
[2]
