Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(ints):
    counts = [0] * 301

    for i in ints:
        counts[i] += 1

    r = []
    for i in range(len(counts)):
        if counts[i] >= 3:
            r.append(str(i))
    counts.clear()
    return''.join(r)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns a string containing the integers that appear at least three times in the input list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89], we need to count the occurrences of each integer in the input list.
We can use a list of size 301 to store the counts of each integer from 0 to 300.
We can iterate over the input list and increment the count of each integer in the counts list.
We can then iterate over the counts list and append the integers that appear at least three times to a new list.
Finally, we can join the elements of the new list into a single string separated by spaces and return the resulting string.
<<<Output>>>
'2 5 89'
