Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    a = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        nums.insert(i, nums[a])
        a += 1
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 3, -1, 1, -2, 6])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The function initializes a variable a to 0.
The function iterates over the indices of the list using a for loop.
For each index i, the function inserts the value at index a into the list at index i.
The function increments the value of a by 1.
Finally, the function returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 3, -1, 1, -2, 6], we need to insert the values at indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 into the list.

The first value at index 0 is 1, so we insert it at index 0.
The second value at index 1 is 3, so we insert it at index 1.
The third value at index 2 is -1, so we insert it at index 2.
The fourth value at index 3 is 1, so we insert it at index 3.
The fifth value at index 4 is -2, so we insert it at index 4.
The sixth value at index 5 is 6, so we insert it at index 5.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 3, -1, 1, -2, 6] is [1, 3, -1, 1, -2, 6, 1, 3, -1, 1, -2, 6].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, -1, 1, -2, 6, 1, 3, -1, 1, -2, 6]
