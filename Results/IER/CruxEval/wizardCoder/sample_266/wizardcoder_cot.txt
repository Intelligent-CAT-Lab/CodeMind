Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)-1, -1, -1):
        if nums[i] % 2 == 1:
            nums.insert(i+1, nums[i])
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([2, 3, 4, 6, -2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The function iterates through the list of integers in reverse order using a for loop.
For each integer in the list, the function checks if it is odd using the modulo operator (%).
If the integer is odd, the function inserts it into the list after the current index using the insert() method.
The function returns the modified list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 3, 4, 6, -2], we need to insert -2 after the second index (index 1) in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 3, 4, 6, -2] is [2, -2, 3, 4, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[2, -2, 3, 4, 6]
