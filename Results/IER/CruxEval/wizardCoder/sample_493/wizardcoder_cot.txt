Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(d):
    keys = []
    for k in d:
        keys.append('%s => %s' % (k, d[k]))
    return keys
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'-4':'4','1':'2','-':'-3'})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns a list of strings.
The function iterates over the keys of the dictionary and appends a string to the list for each key-value pair.
The string is constructed using the format method, which takes two arguments: the key and the value of the current key-value pair.
For example, the first string in the list would be '-4 => 4'.
The function returns the list of strings.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'-4':'4','1':'2','-':'-3'}, we need to iterate over the keys of the dictionary and construct the list of strings.
The resulting list would be: ['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3'].
<<<Output>>>
['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3']
