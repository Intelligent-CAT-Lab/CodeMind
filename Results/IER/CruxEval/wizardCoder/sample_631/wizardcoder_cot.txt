Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, num):
    req = num - len(text)
    text = text.center(num, '*')
    return text[:req // 2: -req // 2]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('a', 19)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and num.
The variable req is assigned the difference between num and the length of text.
The variable text is assigned the result of calling the center() method on text, with num as the width and '*' as the fill character.
The return value of the function is the result of calling the slice notation on text, with the start index set to req // 2, the step set to -req // 2, and the stop index set to None.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "a" and 19, we need to call the function with the parameters "a" and 19.
The variable req is assigned the value 18.
The variable text is assigned the value "***a***".
The return value of the function is the value "a".
<<<Output>>>
'a'
