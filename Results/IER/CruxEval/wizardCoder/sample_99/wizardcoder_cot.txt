Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, sep, num):
    return '___'.join(text.rsplit(sep, num))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('aa+++bb', '+', 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, sep, and num.
The text parameter is a string that we want to split.
The sep parameter is the separator that we want to use to split the text.
The num parameter is the maximum number of splits to do.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "aa+++bb", "+", 1), we need to split the string "aa+++bb" using the separator "+" and only do one split.

The rsplit() method of the string class is used to split the string from the right side. It splits the string at the last occurrence of the separator and returns a list of substrings.

The join() method of the string class is used to concatenate the list of substrings using the separator "___".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "aa+++bb", "+", 1) is "aa___bb".
<<<Output>>>
'aa___bb'
