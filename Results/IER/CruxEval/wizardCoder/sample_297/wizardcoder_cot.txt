Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(num):
    if 0 < num < 1000 and num!= 6174:
        return 'Half Life'
    return 'Not found'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(6173)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a number num as input and checks if it is between 0 and 1000 (inclusive) and not equal to 6174.
If the condition is true, the function returns the string 'Half Life'.
If the condition is false, the function returns the string 'Not found'.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 6173, we need to check if 6173 is between 0 and 1000 (inclusive) and not equal to 6174.
Since 6173 is not between 0 and 1000 (inclusive) and not equal to 6174, the function returns 'Not found'.
<<<Output>>>
'Not found'
