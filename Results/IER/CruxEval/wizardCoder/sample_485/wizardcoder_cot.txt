Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(tokens):
    tokens = tokens.split()
    if len(tokens) == 2:
        tokens = list(reversed(tokens))
    result =''.join([tokens[0].ljust(5), tokens[1].ljust(5)])
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('gsd avdropj')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string tokens as input and splits it into a list of tokens using the split() method.
If the length of the list of tokens is 2, the list of tokens is reversed using the reversed() method.
The result is a string that is constructed by joining the first and second tokens with a space and using the ljust() method to ensure that each token is padded with spaces to a length of 5 characters.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "gsd avdropj", we need to split the input into two tokens "gsd" and "avdropj", reverse the order of the tokens if the length of the list of tokens is 2, and construct the result string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "gsd avdropj" is "gsd avdropj".
<<<Output>>>
'gsd avdropj'
