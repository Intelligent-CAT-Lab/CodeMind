Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(ans):
    if ans.isdecimal():
        total = int(ans) * 4 - 50
        total -= len([c for c in list(ans) if c not in '02468']) * 100
        return total
    return 'NAN'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('0')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string ans as input.
The first line of the function checks if ans is a decimal number using the isdecimal() method.
If ans is a decimal number, the function calculates the total by multiplying ans by 4 and subtracting 50.
The second line of the function calculates the total by subtracting 100 for each digit in ans that is not a 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
If ans is not a decimal number, the function returns the string 'NAN'.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '0', we need to check if '0' is a decimal number.
Since '0' is a decimal number, the first line of the function will execute and the total will be 0 - 50 = -50.
The second line of the function will not execute since there are no non-zero digits in '0'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '0' is -50.
<<<Output>>>
-50
