Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    if ',' in text:
        before, _, after = text.partition(',')
        return after +'' + before
    return ',' + text.partition(' ')[-1] +'0'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('244, 105, -90')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input.
The if statement checks if the string contains a comma.
If it does, the function splits the string into three parts: before the comma, the comma itself, and after the comma.
The function then returns the concatenation of the after part with a space and the before part.
If the string does not contain a comma, the function splits the string into two parts: the first word and the rest of the string.
The function then returns the concatenation of a comma, the last word of the string, and the string " 0".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "244, 105, -90", we need to split the string into three parts: "244", ",", " 105, -90".
The function then returns the concatenation of " 105, -90" with a space and "244".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "244, 105, -90" is " 105, -90 244".
<<<Output>>>
' 105, -90 244'
