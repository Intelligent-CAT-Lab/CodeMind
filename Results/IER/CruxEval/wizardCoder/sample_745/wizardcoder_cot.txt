Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(address):
    suffix_start = address.index('@') + 1
    if address[suffix_start:].count('.') > 1:
        address = address.removesuffix('.'.join(address.split('@')[1].split('.')[:2]))
    return address
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('minimc@minimc.io')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an email address as input and returns the modified email address.
The function first finds the index of '@' in the input address using the index() method.
The index of '@' is used to determine the start of the domain name.
The domain name is then split into two parts using the split() method.
The first two parts of the domain name are joined together using the join() method.
The resulting string is then used to remove the suffix of the email address using the removesuffix() method.
The modified email address is then returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input'minimc@minimc.io', we need to remove the suffix '.io' from the domain name'minimc.io'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input'minimc@minimc.io' is'minimc@minimc'.
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
