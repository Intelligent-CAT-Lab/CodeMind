Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(sb):
    d = {}
    for s in sb:
        d[s] = d.get(s, 0) + 1
    return d
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('meow meow')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string sb as input and returns a dictionary d.
The dictionary d will have keys as characters in the string sb and values as the number of occurrences of each character in the string sb.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "meow meow", we need to count the occurrences of each character in the string "meow meow".
The dictionary d will have the following key-value pairs:
{'m': 2, 'e': 3, 'o': 2, 'w': 2}
<<<Output>>>
{'m': 2, 'e': 3, 'o': 2, 'w': 2}
