Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    nums = ['{0:{fill}>{width}}'.format(val, **{'fill': '0', 'width': nums[0]}) for val in nums[1:]]
    return [str(val) for val in nums]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['1', '2', '2', '44', '0', '7', '20257'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings as input.
The first element of the list is the width of the output string.
The remaining elements of the list are the numbers to be converted to strings.
The function first creates a list of strings with the desired width by using a list comprehension.
The list comprehension iterates over the remaining elements of the list and uses the format method to create a string with the desired width.
The format method takes two arguments: the value to be formatted and a dictionary of keyword arguments.
The keyword arguments specify the fill character and the width of the output string.
The fill character is set to '0' and the width is set to the first element of the list.
The function then converts the list of strings to a list of integers using a list comprehension.
The list comprehension iterates over the elements of the list and uses the int function to convert each string to an integer.
The function then returns the list of integers as a list of strings using another list comprehension.
<<<Output>>>The return value of the code is:
['000001', '000002', '000002', '000044', '000000', '000007', '20257']
