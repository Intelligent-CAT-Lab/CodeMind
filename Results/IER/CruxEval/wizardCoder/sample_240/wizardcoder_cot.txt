Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(float_number):
    number = str(float_number)
    dot = number.find('.')
    if dot!= -1:
        return number[:dot] + '.' + number[dot+1:].ljust(2, '0')
    return number + '.00'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(3.121)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a float number as input and converts it to a string.
Then it finds the index of the first occurrence of the decimal point in the string.
If the decimal point is found, it extracts the integer part of the number and the fractional part of the number and concatenates them with a dot and two zeros.
If the decimal point is not found, it appends a dot and two zeros to the end of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 3.121, we need to convert 3.121 to a string and then extract the integer part and the fractional part.
The integer part is "3" and the fractional part is "121".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 3.121 is "3.12".
<<<Output>>>
'3.12'
