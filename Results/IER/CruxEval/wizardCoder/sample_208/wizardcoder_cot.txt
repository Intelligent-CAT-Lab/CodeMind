Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        for d in item:
            if not d.isdigit():
                result.append(d)
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['123', 'cat', 'd dee'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of characters that are not digits.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['123', 'cat', 'd dee'], we need to iterate over each string in the list and then iterate over each character in the string. If the character is not a digit, we append it to the result list.

The first string in the list is '123'. We iterate over each character in the string and find that none of them are digits. Therefore, we append each character to the result list.

The second string in the list is 'cat'. We iterate over each character in the string and find that none of them are digits. Therefore, we append each character to the result list.

The third string in the list is 'd dee'. We iterate over each character in the string and find that 'd' and 'e' are not digits. Therefore, we append 'd' and 'e' to the result list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['123', 'cat', 'd dee'] is ['1', '2', '3', 'c', 'a', 't', 'd', 'e', 'e'].
<<<Output>>>['1', '2', '3', 'c', 'a', 't', 'd', 'e', 'e']
