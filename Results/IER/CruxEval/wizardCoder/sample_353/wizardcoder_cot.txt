Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    if x == []:
        return -1
    else:
        cache = {}
        for item in x:
            if item in cache:
                cache[item] += 1
            else:
                cache[item] = 1
        return max(cache.values())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list x as input.
If the list x is empty, the function returns -1.
Otherwise, the function creates an empty dictionary cache.
The function then iterates over each item in the list x.
If the item is already in the cache, the function increments the count of the item in the cache.
Otherwise, the function adds the item to the cache with a count of 1.
Finally, the function returns the maximum count in the cache.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1], we need to count the occurrences of each item in the list.
The list [1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1] contains the items 1, 0, 2, and 1.
The count of 1 in the list is 2, the count of 0 is 3, and the count of 2 is 2.
Therefore, the maximum count in the cache is 2, which corresponds to the return value of the function f on the input [1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1].
<<<Output>>>
2
