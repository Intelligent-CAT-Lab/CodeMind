Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(names):
    count = len(names)
    numberOfNames = 0
    for i in names:
        if i.isalpha():
            numberOfNames += 1
    return numberOfNames
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of names as input and returns the number of names that contain only alphabetical characters.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee'], we need to count the number of names that contain only alphabetical characters.
The first name in the list is "sharron", which contains only alphabetical characters.
The second name in the list is "Savannah", which contains only alphabetical characters.
The third name in the list is "Mike Cherokee", which contains only alphabetical characters.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee'] is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
