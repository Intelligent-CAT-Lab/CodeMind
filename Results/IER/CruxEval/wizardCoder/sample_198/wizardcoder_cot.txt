Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, strip_chars):
    return text[::-1].strip(strip_chars)[::-1]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('tcmfsmj', 'cfj')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and strip_chars.
The first line of the function reverses the text using slicing.
The second line of the function strips the characters in strip_chars from the reversed text using the strip() method.
The third line of the function reverses the stripped text again using slicing.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "tcmfsmj" and "cfj", we need to reverse "tcmfsmj", strip "cfj" from the reversed text, and then reverse the result.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "tcmfsmj" and "cfj" is "jmmfsmt".
<<<Output>>>
'jmmfsmt'
