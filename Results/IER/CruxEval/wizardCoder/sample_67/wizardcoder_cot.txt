Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(num1, num2, num3):
    nums = [num1, num2, num3]
    nums.sort()    
    return f'{nums[0]},{nums[1]},{nums[2]}'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(6,8,8)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three numbers as input and sorts them in ascending order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (6,8,8), we need to sort the numbers [6,8,8] in ascending order.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (6,8,8) is "6,8,8".
<<<Output>>>
'6,8,8'
