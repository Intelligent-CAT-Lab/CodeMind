What would be the return value of `f('ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ', 'J')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and search_string.
The function initializes an empty list called indexes.
The function enters a while loop that continues as long as the search_string is found in the text.
Inside the while loop, the function appends the index of the last occurrence of the search_string in the text to the indexes list.
The function then updates the text by slicing it from the beginning up to the index of the last occurrence of the search_string.
The function continues the while loop until the search_string is no longer found in the text.
Finally, the function returns the indexes list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ" and "J", we need to find all the occurrences of "J" in the text and return their indexes.
The first occurrence of "J" is at index 10, the second occurrence is at index 15, and so on.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ" and "J" is [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 200, 205, 210, 215, 220, 225, 230, 235, 240, 245, 250, 255, 260, 265, 270
