Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(d, l):
	new_d = {}

	for k in l:
		if d.get(k) is not None:
			new_d[k] = d[k]

	return new_d.copy()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}, ["lorem ipsum", "dolor"])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a dictionary d and a list l.
The function creates a new dictionary new_d.
The function iterates over the keys of l and checks if the corresponding key exists in d.
If the key exists, the value of the key is added to new_d.
Finally, the function returns a copy of new_d.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}, ["lorem ipsum", "dolor"], we need to create a new dictionary new_d with the key-value pairs {"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}.
Then, we iterate over the keys of ["lorem ipsum", "dolor"] and check if the corresponding key exists in {"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}.
The key "lorem ipsum" exists in the input dictionary, so its value 12 is added to new_d.
The key "dolor" also exists in the input dictionary, so its value 23 is added to new_d.
Finally, we return a copy of new_d, which is {"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}.

<<<Output>>>
{"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}
