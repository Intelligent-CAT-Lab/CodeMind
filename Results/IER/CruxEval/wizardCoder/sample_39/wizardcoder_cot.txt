Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    if elem in array:
        return array.index(elem)
    return -1
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([6, 2, 7, 1], 6)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, an array and an element.
The function checks if the element is present in the array using the "in" operator.
If the element is present, the function returns the index of the element in the array using the "index" method.
If the element is not present, the function returns -1.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 2, 7, 1], 6), we need to check if 6 is present in the array [6, 2, 7, 1].
6 is present in the array at index 0, so the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 2, 7, 1], 6) is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
