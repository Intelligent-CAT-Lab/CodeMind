Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(k, j):
    arr = []
    for i in range(k):
        arr.append(j)
    return arr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(7, 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters k and j. It initializes an empty list arr. It then iterates over the range of k and appends the value of j to the list arr. Finally, it returns the list arr.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (7, 5), we need to append 5 to an empty list 7 times.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (7, 5) is [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
