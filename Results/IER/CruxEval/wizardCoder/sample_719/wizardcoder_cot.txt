Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(code):
    lines = code.split(']')
    result = []
    level = 0
    for line in lines:
        result.append(line[0] +'' +''* level + line[1:])
        level += line.count('{') - line.count('}')
    return '\n'.join(result)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("if (x) {y = 1;} else {z = 1;}")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string code as input and returns a string that represents the code in a formatted way.
The input code is a string that represents a program.
The code is split into lines using the split method.
A list is initialized to store the formatted lines.
A variable level is initialized to 0.
For each line in the code, the first character is added to the result list, followed by two spaces, and then the rest of the line is added.
The level variable is updated by adding the number of opening curly braces to the number of closing curly braces in the line.
The formatted lines are joined together using the join method and returned as a string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "if (x) {y = 1;} else {z = 1;}", we need to format the code in a way that is easy to read.
The formatted code should look like this:

if (x) {
  y = 1;
} else {
  z = 1;
}

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "if (x) {y = 1;} else {z = 1;}" is the formatted code.
<<<Output>>>
if (x) {
  y = 1;
} else {
  z = 1;
}
