Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    count = len(nums)
    for i in range(-count+1, 0):
        nums.extend([nums[i], nums[i]])
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([0, 6, 2, -1, -2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The variable count is initialized to the length of the nums list.
The for loop iterates over the range of indices from -count+1 to 0.
Inside the loop, the nums list is extended by appending the value of nums[i] twice.
The return value of the function is the modified nums list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, 2, -1, -2], we need to apply the following steps:
- Initialize count to 5 (the length of the input list).
- Iterate over the range of indices from -count+1 to 0.
- Inside the loop, nums is extended by appending the values of nums[i] twice:
  - nums is extended by [0, 0]
  - nums is extended by [6, 6]
  - nums is extended by [2, 2]
  - nums is extended by [-1, -1]
  - nums is extended by [-2, -2]
- The modified nums list is [0, 0, 6, 6, 2, 2, -1, -1, -2, -2].
- The return value of the function is [0, 0, 6, 6, 2, 2, -1, -1, -2, -2].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 0, 6, 6, 2, 2, -1, -1, -2, -2]
