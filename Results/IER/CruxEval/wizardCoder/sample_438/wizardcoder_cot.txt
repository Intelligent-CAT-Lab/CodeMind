Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    bigTab = 100
    for i in range(10, 30):
        if 0 < string.count('\t') < 20:
            bigTab = i
            break
    return string.expandtabs(bigTab)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('1  \t\t\t3')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and returns the string with the maximum number of tabs expanded to 100.
The function first initializes a variable bigTab to 100.
The function then loops through the range of numbers from 10 to 30.
For each number in the range, the function checks if the number of tabs in the input string is less than 20.
If the number of tabs is less than 20, the function sets the value of bigTab to the current number.
The function then breaks out of the loop.
Finally, the function returns the input string with the maximum number of tabs expanded to the value of bigTab.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "1  \t\t\t3", we need to expand the tabs to the maximum number of tabs possible.
The input string has 3 tabs.
The maximum number of tabs possible is 100.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "1  \t\t\t3" is "1  \t\t\t3".
<<<Output>>>
'1  \t\t\t3'
