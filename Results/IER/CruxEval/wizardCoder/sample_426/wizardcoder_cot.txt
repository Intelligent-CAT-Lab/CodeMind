Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(numbers, elem, idx):
    numbers.insert(idx, elem)
    return numbers
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3], 8, 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a list of numbers, an element to be inserted into the list, and the index at which the element should be inserted.
The function inserts the element into the list at the specified index and returns the updated list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], 8, and 5, we need to insert 8 at index 5 of the list [1, 2, 3].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], 8, and 5 is [1, 2, 3, None, None, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, None, None, 8]
