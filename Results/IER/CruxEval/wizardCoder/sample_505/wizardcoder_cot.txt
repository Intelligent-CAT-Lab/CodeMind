Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    while string:
        if string[-1].isalpha():
            return string
        string = string[:-1]
    return string
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('--4/0-209')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and returns the last alphabetic character in the string.
The input string is "--4/0-209".
The first character of the string is "-". It is not alphabetic.
The second character of the string is "4". It is not alphabetic.
The third character of the string is "/". It is not alphabetic.
The fourth character of the string is "0". It is not alphabetic.
The fifth character of the string is "-". It is not alphabetic.
The sixth character of the string is "2". It is not alphabetic.
The seventh character of the string is "0". It is not alphabetic.
The eighth character of the string is "9". It is not alphabetic.
Therefore, the last alphabetic character in the string is "9".
<<<Output>>>
'9'
