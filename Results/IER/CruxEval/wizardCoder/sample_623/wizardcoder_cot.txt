Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, rules):
    for rule in rules:
        if rule == '@':
            text = text[::-1]
        elif rule == '~':
            text = text.upper()
        elif text and text[len(text)-1] == rule:
            text = text[0:len(text)-1]
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('hi~!', ['~', '`', '!', '&'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, text and rules.
The rules argument is a list of characters that can be used to modify the text.
The function iterates over each rule in the rules list.
If the rule is '@', the function reverses the text.
If the rule is '~', the function converts the text to uppercase.
If the rule is the last character in the text, the function removes the last character from the text.
Finally, the function returns the modified text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi~!", we need to apply the following rules:
- Reverse the text: "hi~!" -> "!~ih"
- Convert the text to uppercase: "!~IH"
- Remove the last character: "!~I"
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi~!" is "!~I".
<<<Output>>>
'!~I'
