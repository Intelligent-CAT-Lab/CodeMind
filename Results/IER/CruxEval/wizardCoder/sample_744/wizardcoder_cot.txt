Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, new_ending):
    result = list(text)
    result.extend(new_ending)
    return ''.join(result)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('jro', 'wdlp')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and new_ending.
The first line of the function creates a list called result by converting the input text into a list of characters.
The second line extends the result list by appending the characters in the new_ending parameter.
The third line returns the result list as a string by joining the characters together with the empty string as a separator.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "jro" and "wdlp", we need to concatenate the two strings into a new string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "jro" and "wdlp" is "jrowdlp".
<<<Output>>>
'jrowdlp'
