Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    count = text.count(char*2)
    return text[count:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('vzzv2sg', 'z')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and char.
The first line of the function counts the number of occurrences of the string char*2 in the text.
The second line of the function returns the substring of text starting from the index count.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "vzzv2sg" and the character 'z', we need to count the number of occurrences of 'zz' in 'vzzv2sg'.
Therefore, the count is 2.
The second line of the function returns the substring of 'vzzv2sg' starting from the index 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "vzzv2sg" and the character 'z' is "v2sg".
<<<Output>>>
'v2sg'
