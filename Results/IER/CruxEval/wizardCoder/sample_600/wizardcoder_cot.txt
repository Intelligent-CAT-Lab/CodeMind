Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    just_ns = list(map(lambda num: 'n'*num, array))
    final_output = []
    for wipe in just_ns:
        final_output.append(wipe)
    return final_output
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a list of strings.
The list comprehension inside the function uses the map() function to apply a lambda function to each element of the input array.
The lambda function takes a number num as input and returns a string 'n'*num, which is the number of 'n's equal to the value of num.
The list comprehension then creates a new list by concatenating each string returned by the lambda function.
Finally, the function returns the final list of strings.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [], we need to apply the lambda function to each element of the input array, resulting in an empty list.
The list comprehension then creates a new list by concatenating each string returned by the lambda function, resulting in an empty list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [] is an empty list.
<<<Output>>>
[]
