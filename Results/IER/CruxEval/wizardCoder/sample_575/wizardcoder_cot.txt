Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, val):
    new_list = []
    [new_list.extend([i] * val) for i in nums]
    return sum(new_list)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([10, 4], 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, nums and val.
nums is a list of integers, and val is an integer.
The function creates a new empty list called new_list.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of nums and append val copies of each element to new_list.
Finally, the function returns the sum of the elements in new_list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [10, 4] and val=3, we need to create a new list [10, 10, 10, 4, 4, 4] and return the sum of its elements, which is 45.
<<<Output>>>45
