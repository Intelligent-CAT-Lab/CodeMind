Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, amount):
    length = len(text)
    pre_text = '|'
    if amount >= length:
        extra_space = amount - length
        pre_text +='' * (extra_space // 2)
        return pre_text + text + pre_text
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('GENERAL NAGOOR', 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and amount.
The length of the text is calculated using the len() function.
If the amount is greater than or equal to the length of the text, then the function adds extra spaces before and after the text to make the total length equal to the amount.
If the amount is less than the length of the text, then the function returns the original text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "GENERAL NAGOOR" and amount 5, we need to check if the amount is greater than or equal to the length of the text.
Since the length of the text is 16, the amount is greater than or equal to the length of the text.
Therefore, the function adds extra spaces before and after the text to make the total length equal to the amount.
The extra spaces are added to the left and right of the text.
The total length of the text is 5, so the function adds 2 spaces before and after the text.
The final output is '|  GENERAL NAGOOR  |'.
<<<Output>>>
'|  GENERAL NAGOOR  |'
