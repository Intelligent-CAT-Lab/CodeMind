Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    array_2 = []
    for i in array:
        if i>0:
            array_2 += [i]
    array_2.sort(reverse=True)
    return array_2
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array containing only the positive integers from the input array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14], we need to iterate through the input array and add all positive integers to a new array.
The new array should contain [17, 89, 43, 14].
Next, we need to sort the new array in descending order.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14] is [17, 89, 43, 14].
<<<Output>>>
[17, 89, 43, 14]
