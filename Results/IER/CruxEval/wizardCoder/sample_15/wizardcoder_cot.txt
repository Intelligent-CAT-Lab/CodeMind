Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, wrong, right):
    new_text = text.replace(wrong, right)
    return new_text.upper()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("zn kgd jw lnt", "h", "u")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, wrong, and right.
The function replaces all occurrences of the string wrong in the string text with the string right.
The function then converts the modified string to uppercase and returns it.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "zn kgd jw lnt", "h", and "u", we need to replace all occurrences of "h" with "u" in the string "zn kgd jw lnt". Then we need to convert the modified string to uppercase.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "zn kgd jw lnt", "h", and "u" is "zn kgd jw lnt".
<<<Output>>>
'ZN KGD JW LNT'
