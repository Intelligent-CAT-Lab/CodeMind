Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, index):
    return nums[index] % 42 + nums.pop(index) * 2
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([3, 2, 0, 3, 7], 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a list of integers nums and an integer index.
The function returns the remainder of the element at the specified index in the list when divided by 42, plus twice the value of the element that is removed from the list at the specified index.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 2, 0, 3, 7], 3), we need to calculate the remainder of the element at index 3 (which is 3) when divided by 42, plus twice the value of the element that is removed from the list at index 3 (which is 3).
The element that is removed from the list at index 3 is 3, so the value of the element that is removed from the list at index 3 multiplied by 2 is 6.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 2, 0, 3, 7], 3) is 3 % 42 + 3 * 2 = 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
