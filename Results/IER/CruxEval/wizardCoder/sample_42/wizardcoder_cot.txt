Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    nums.clear()
    for num in nums:
        nums.append(num*2)
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The function clears the list nums using the clear() method.
The function then iterates over each element num in the list nums.
For each element num, the function appends the result of multiplying num by 2 to the list nums using the append() method.
Finally, the function returns the modified list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2], we need to clear the list [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2] using the clear() method.
Then, we need to iterate over each element num in the cleared list [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2] and append the result of multiplying num by 2 to the list [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2] using the append() method.
Therefore, the modified list [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2] is [8, 6, 4, 2, 4, -2, 8, 4].

The return value of the function f on the input [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2] is [8, 6, 4, 2, 4, -2, 8, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[8, 6, 4, 2, 4, -2, 8, 4]
