Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, rmvalue):
    res = nums[:]
    while rmvalue in res:
        popped = res.pop(res.index(rmvalue))
        if popped!= rmvalue:
            res.append(popped)
    return res
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([6, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1], 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a list of integers nums and an integer rmvalue.
The function creates a copy of the input list using the slicing operator [:].
The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as rmvalue is in the list.
Inside the while loop, the function pops the first occurrence of rmvalue from the list using the index method and appends it to the end of the list if it is not equal to rmvalue.
The function continues to pop and append elements from the list until rmvalue is no longer in the list.
Finally, the function returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1], 5), we need to remove all occurrences of 5 from the list [6, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1].
The modified list after removing all occurrences of 5 is [6, 2, 1, 4].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1], 5) is [6, 2, 1, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[6, 2, 1, 4]
