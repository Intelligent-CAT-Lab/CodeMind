Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, delim):
    return text[:text[::-1].find(delim)][::-1]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('dsj osq wi w','')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and delim.
The first line of the function uses slicing to extract the substring of text that comes before the first occurrence of the delimiter (in reverse order).
The second line of the function uses the find method to find the index of the delimiter in the reversed text.
The third line of the function uses slicing again to extract the substring of text that comes after the delimiter (in reverse order).
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "dsj osq wi w" and the delimiter " " is "w i w".
<<<Output>>>
'w i w'
