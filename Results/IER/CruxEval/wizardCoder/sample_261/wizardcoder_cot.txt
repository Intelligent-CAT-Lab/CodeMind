Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, target):
    lows, higgs = [], []
    for i in nums:
        if i < target:
            lows.append(i)
        else:
            higgs.append(i)
    lows.clear()
    return lows, higgs
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, nums and target.
The nums argument is a list of integers.
The target argument is an integer.
The function creates two empty lists, lows and higgs.
The function iterates through the nums list and appends each integer to the appropriate list based on whether it is less than or greater than the target.
The function clears the lows list.
The function returns a tuple containing the lows list and the higgs list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], 5), we need to execute the function with the given input.
The lows list will be [12, 5, 2, 3, 214] and the higgs list will be [516, 51].
The function returns a tuple containing the lows list and the higgs list.

<<<Output>>>
([12, 5, 2, 3, 214], [516, 51])
