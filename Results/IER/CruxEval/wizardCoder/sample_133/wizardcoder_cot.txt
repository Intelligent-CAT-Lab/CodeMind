Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, elements):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(elements)):
        result.append(nums.pop())
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2], [9, 0, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, nums and elements.
nums is a list of integers, and elements is a list of integers.
The function creates an empty list called result.
The function iterates over the elements list using a for loop and the range function.
Inside the loop, the function pops the last element from the nums list and appends it to the result list.
After the loop is finished, the function returns the nums list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2], [9, 0, 3], we need to execute the function with the given input.
The nums list is [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2] and the elements list is [9, 0, 3].
The function first creates an empty list called result.
The function then iterates over the elements list using a for loop and the range function.
Inside the loop, the function pops the last element from the nums list and appends it to the result list.
The result list is [7, 1, 2, 6, 0].
The function then returns the nums list, which is [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2], [9, 0, 3] is [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2]
