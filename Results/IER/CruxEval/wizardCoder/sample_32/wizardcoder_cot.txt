Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, sep):
    reverse = ['*' + e for e in s.split(sep)]
    return ';'.join(reversed(reverse))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('volume', 'l')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, s and sep.
The parameter s is a string that represents the input string.
The parameter sep is a string that represents the separator to split the input string.

The function first splits the input string s using the separator sep.
Then it creates a list of strings where each string is the concatenation of the separator and an element of the split list.
For example, if s is 'volume' and sep is 'l', the list of strings would be ['*o', '*u', '*m', '*e', '*t', '*r', '*a'].

The function then reverses the order of the list of strings using the reversed() function.
Finally, it joins the list of strings using the separator ';' and returns the resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'volume' and separator 'l', we need to split the input string 'volume' using the separator 'l' and create a list of strings where each string is the concatenation of the separator and an element of the split list.
Then we reverse the order of the list of strings using the reversed() function.
Finally, we join the list of strings using the separator ';' and return the resulting string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'volume' and separator 'l' is '*o;*u;*m;*e;*t;*r;*a'.
<<<Output>>>
'*o;*u;*m;*e;*t;*r;*a'
