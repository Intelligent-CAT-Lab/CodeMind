Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    count = len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
        nums.insert(i, nums.pop(0))
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([0, -5, -4])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The variable count is initialized to the length of the list nums.
The for loop iterates over the indices of the list nums in reverse order.
Inside the loop, the first element of the list nums is popped and inserted at the current index i.
The loop continues until all elements of the list nums have been shifted one position to the right.
Finally, the function returns the modified list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, -5, -4], we need to shift the elements of the list to the right.
The first element of the list is -5, which is popped and inserted at index 0.
The second element of the list is -4, which is popped and inserted at index 1.
The third element of the list is 0, which is popped and inserted at index 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, -5, -4] is [-5, -4, 0].
<<<Output>>>
[-5, -4, 0]
