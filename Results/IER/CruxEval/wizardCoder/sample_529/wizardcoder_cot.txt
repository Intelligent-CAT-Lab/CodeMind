Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    prev = array[0]
    newArray = array[:]
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        if prev!= array[i]:
            newArray[i] = array[i]
        else:
            del newArray[i]
        prev = array[i]
    return newArray
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array with the same elements as the input array, but with duplicates removed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to iterate over the array and compare each element with the previous element. If the current element is different from the previous element, we add it to the new array. If the current element is the same as the previous element, we remove it from the new array.

The first iteration of the loop will compare 1 with None, so we add 1 to the new array.
The second iteration of the loop will compare 2 with 1, so we remove 2 from the new array.
The third iteration of the loop will compare 3 with 2, so we remove 3 from the new array.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1].
<<<Output>>>
[1]
