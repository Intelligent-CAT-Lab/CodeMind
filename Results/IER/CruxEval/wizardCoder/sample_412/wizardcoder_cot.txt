Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(start, end, interval):
    steps = list(range(start, end + 1, interval))
    if 1 in steps:
        steps[-1] = end + 1
    return len(steps)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(3, 10, 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: start, end, and interval.
The function creates a list of integers from start to end with a step size of interval.
If the list contains the integer 1, the last element of the list is replaced with the value of end + 1.
Finally, the function returns the length of the list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (3, 10, 1), we need to create a list of integers from 3 to 10 with a step size of 1.
The list is [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
The list does not contain the integer 1, so the last element is not replaced.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (3, 10, 1) is 8.
<<<Output>>>8
