Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(txt, alpha):
    txt = sorted(txt)
    if txt.index(alpha) % 2 == 0:
        return txt[::-1]
    return txt
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['8', '9', '7', '4', '3', '2'], '9')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, txt and alpha.
The txt argument is a list of strings.
The alpha argument is a string.

The function first sorts the list txt in ascending order.
Then it checks if the index of alpha in the sorted list is even or odd.
If the index is even, the function returns the reversed list txt.
If the index is odd, the function returns the original list txt.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['8', '9', '7', '4', '3', '2'], '9', we need to sort the list ['8', '9', '7', '4', '3', '2'] to get ['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9'].
The index of '9' in the sorted list is 2, which is odd.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['8', '9', '7', '4', '3', '2'], '9' is ['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9'].
<<<Output>>>
['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9']
