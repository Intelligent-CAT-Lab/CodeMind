Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    for i in str(n):
        if not i.isdigit():
            n = -1
            break
    return n
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("6 ** 2")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string n as input and converts it to an integer using the int() function.
The for loop iterates over each character in the string n and checks if it is a digit using the isdigit() method.
If a non-digit character is found, the variable n is set to -1 and the loop is broken using the break statement.
If all characters in the string n are digits, the variable n remains unchanged and the function returns its value.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "6 ** 2", we need to convert "6 ** 2" to an integer using the int() function.
The string "6 ** 2" is a valid Python expression that evaluates to 36.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "6 ** 2" is 36.
<<<Output>>>
36
