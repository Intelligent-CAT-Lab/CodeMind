Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(items, target):
    for i in items.split():
        if i in target:
            return items.index(i)+1
        if i.index('.') == len(i)-1 or i.index('.') == 0:
            return 'error'
    return '.'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("qy. dg. rnvprt rse.. irtwv tx..", "wtwdoacb")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, items and target.
The items argument is a string that contains a list of items separated by spaces.
The target argument is a string that contains a list of items separated by spaces.

The function f iterates through each item in the items string using the split() method.
For each item, the function checks if it is in the target string using the in operator.
If the item is in the target string, the function returns the index of the item in the items string plus 1.
If the item is not in the target string, the function checks if it has a period at the beginning or end of the string using the index() method.
If the item has a period at the beginning or end of the string, the function returns the string 'error'.
If none of the items in the items string match the target string and none of the items have a period at the beginning or end of the string, the function returns the string '.'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "qy. dg. rnvprt rse.. irtwv tx..", "wtwdoacb", we need to iterate through each item in the items string and check if it is in the target string.
The first item in the items string is "qy", which is not in the target string.
The second item in the items string is "dg", which is not in the target string.
The third item in the items string is "rnvprt", which is not in the target string.
The fourth item in the items string is "rse", which is not in the target string.
The fifth item in the items string is "irtwv", which is not in the target string.
The sixth item in the items string is "tx", which is not in the target string.
The seventh item in the items string is ".", which is not in the target string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "qy. dg. rnvprt rse.. irtwv tx..", "wtwdoacb" is "error".
<<<Output>>>
'error'
