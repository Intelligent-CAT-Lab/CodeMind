Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    a = text.strip().split(' ')
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i].isdigit() is False:
            return '-'
    return " ".join(a)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("d khqw whi fwi bbn 41")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following operations:
1. Remove leading and trailing whitespaces using the strip() method.
2. Split the string into a list of words using the split() method.
3. Iterate over the list of words using a for loop.
4. Check if each word is a digit using the isdigit() method.
5. If a word is not a digit, return the string "-".
6. If all words are digits, join the list of words into a single string using the join() method.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41", we need to perform the following operations:
1. Remove leading and trailing whitespaces from the input string to get "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41".
2. Split the string into a list of words using the split() method to get ["d", "khqw", "whi", "fwi", "bbn", "41"].
3. Iterate over the list of words using a for loop.
4. Check if each word is a digit using the isdigit() method.
5. The first word "d" is not a digit, so the function returns "-".
6. The function does not reach the end of the loop, so it joins the list of words into a single string using the join() method to get "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41" is "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41".
<<<Output>>>
'd khqw whi fwi bbn 41'
