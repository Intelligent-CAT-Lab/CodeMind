Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(marks):
    highest = 0
    lowest = 100
    for value in marks.values():
        if value > highest:
            highest = value
        if value < lowest:
            lowest = value
    return highest, lowest
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'x': 67, 'v': 89, '': 4, 'alij': 11, 'kgfsd': 72, 'yafby': 83})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary marks as input.
The function initializes two variables highest and lowest with the values 0 and 100 respectively.
The function iterates over the values of the dictionary marks using a for loop.
For each value, the function checks if it is greater than the current value of highest. If it is, then highest is updated to the new value.
Similarly, the function checks if the value is less than the current value of lowest. If it is, then lowest is updated to the new value.
Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the values of highest and lowest.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'x': 67, 'v': 89, '': 4, 'alij': 11, 'kgfsd': 72, 'yafby': 83}, we need to find the highest and lowest values in the dictionary marks.
The highest value is 89 and the lowest value is 4.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'x': 67, 'v': 89, '': 4, 'alij': 11, 'kgfsd': 72, 'yafby': 83} is (89, 4).
<<<Output>>>
(89, 4)
