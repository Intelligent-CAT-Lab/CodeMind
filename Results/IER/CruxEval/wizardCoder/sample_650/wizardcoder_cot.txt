Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string, substring):
    while string.startswith(substring):
        string = string[len(substring):len(string)]
    return string
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('', 'A')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, string and substring.
The while loop checks if the string starts with the substring.
If it does, the string is sliced from the length of the substring to the end of the string.
If the string does not start with the substring, the function returns the original string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('', 'A'), we need to check if the string '' starts with the substring 'A'.
Since the string '' does not start with 'A', the function returns the original string ''.
<<<Output>>>
''
