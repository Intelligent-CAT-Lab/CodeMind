Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    if text == '42.42':
        return True
    for i in range(3, len(text) - 3):
        if text[i] == '.' and text[i - 3:].isdigit() and text[:i].isdigit():
            return True
    return False
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("123E-10")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and checks if it is equal to '42.42'. If it is, it returns True.
If it is not equal to '42.42', the function checks if the string contains a decimal point and the digits before and after the decimal point are both integers. If it does, it returns True.
If the string does not contain a decimal point or the digits before and after the decimal point are not both integers, the function returns False.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "123E-10", we need to check if the string contains a decimal point and the digits before and after the decimal point are both integers.
The digits before and after the decimal point are both integers because the string "123E-10" contains an exponent, which is denoted by "E" and a negative exponent, which is denoted by "-10". Therefore, the digits before and after the decimal point are both integers.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "123E-10" is True.
<<<Output>>>
True
