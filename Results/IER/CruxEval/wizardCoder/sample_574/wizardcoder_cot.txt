Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(simpons):
    while simpons:
        pop = simpons.pop()
        if pop == pop.title():
            return pop
    return pop
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['George', 'Michael', 'George', 'Costanza'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns the last string that is in title case.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['George', 'Michael', 'George', 'Costanza'], we need to iterate through the list and check if each string is in title case.
The first string in the list is 'George', which is in title case.
The second string in the list is 'Michael', which is not in title case.
The third string in the list is 'George', which is in title case.
The fourth string in the list is 'Costanza', which is not in title case.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['George', 'Michael', 'George', 'Costanza'] is 'George'.
<<<Output>>>
'George'
