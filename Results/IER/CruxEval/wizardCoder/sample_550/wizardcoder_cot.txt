Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        nums.insert(i, nums[i]**2)
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 4])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The for loop iterates over the indices of the list nums.
Inside the loop, the value of nums[i] is squared and inserted at index i in the list nums.
The function returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 4], we need to square each element of the list and insert it at the corresponding index.
The modified list would be [1, 4, 16, 2, 4, 16].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 16, 2, 4, 16]
