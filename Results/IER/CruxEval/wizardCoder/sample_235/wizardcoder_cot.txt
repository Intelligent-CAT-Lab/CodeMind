Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, arr):
    result = []
    for s in arr:
        result += list(filter(lambda l: l!= '', s.split(arr[array.index(s)])))
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([], [])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arrays as input, array and arr.
The function initializes an empty list called result.
The function iterates through each string s in arr.
For each string s, the function uses the index of s in array to find the corresponding element in arr.
The function then uses the filter() function to remove any empty strings from the split() of s using the corresponding element in arr.
The function appends the filtered list to the result list.
Finally, the function returns the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [], []:
- array is an empty array, so the index of any element in array will be out of range.
- arr is also an empty array, so there are no elements to split.
- Therefore, the result list will be empty.

Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input [], [] is an empty list.
<<<Output>>>
[]
