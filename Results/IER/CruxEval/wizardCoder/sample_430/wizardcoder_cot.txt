Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(arr1, arr2):
    new_arr = arr1.copy()
    new_arr.extend(arr2)
    return new_arr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, 1, 3, 7, 8], ['', 0, -1, []])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arrays as input, arr1 and arr2.
The function creates a new array new_arr by copying the elements of arr1 using the copy() method.
The function extends new_arr with the elements of arr2 using the extend() method.
The function returns the new_arr as the output.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 1, 3, 7, 8], ['', 0, -1, []], we need to create a new array new_arr by copying the elements of [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] using the copy() method. Then we need to extend new_arr with the elements of ['', 0, -1, []] using the extend() method. Finally, we need to return the new_arr as the output.

The new_arr will be [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []].

<<<Output>>>
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]
