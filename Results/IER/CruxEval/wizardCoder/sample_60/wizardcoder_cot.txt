Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(doc):
    for x in doc:
        if x.isalpha():
            return x.capitalize()
    return '-'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('raruwa')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string doc as input and iterates over each character in the string.
For each character, it checks if it is an alphabet using the isalpha() method.
If the character is an alphabet, it returns the capitalized version of the character using the capitalize() method.
If the character is not an alphabet, it returns the string '-'.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "raruwa", we need to iterate over each character in the string and check if it is an alphabet.
The first character 'r' is an alphabet, so it returns the capitalized version of 'r' which is 'R'.
The second character 'a' is an alphabet, so it returns the capitalized version of 'a' which is 'A'.
The third character 'r' is an alphabet, so it returns the capitalized version of 'r' which is 'R'.
The fourth character 'u' is an alphabet, so it returns the capitalized version of 'u' which is 'U'.
The fifth character 'w' is an alphabet, so it returns the capitalized version of 'w' which is 'W'.
The sixth character 'a' is an alphabet, so it returns the capitalized version of 'a' which is 'A'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "raruwa" is "RARUWA".
<<<Output>>>
'RARUWA'
