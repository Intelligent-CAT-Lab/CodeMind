Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(parts):
    return list(dict(parts).values())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([('u', 1), ('s', 7), ('u', -5)])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of tuples as input and returns a list of values of the dictionary created from the input list of tuples.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [('u', 1), ('s', 7), ('u', -5)], we need to create a dictionary from the input list of tuples.
The dictionary created from the input list of tuples will have the keys 'u' and's' and the values 1, 7, and -5 respectively.
The list of values of the dictionary created from the input list of tuples will be [1, 7, -5].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [('u', 1), ('s', 7), ('u', -5)] is [1, 7, -5].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 7, -5]
