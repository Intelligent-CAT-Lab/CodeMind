Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    result = []
    for elem in array:
        if elem.isascii() or (isinstance(elem, int) and not str(abs(elem)).isascii()):
            result.append(elem)
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(["a", "b", "c"])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array containing only the ASCII characters of the input array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ["a", "b", "c"], we need to iterate over each element of the input array and check if it is an ASCII character or an integer that is not an ASCII character.
The first element of the input array is "a", which is an ASCII character, so it is added to the result array.
The second element of the input array is "b", which is not an ASCII character, so it is not added to the result array.
The third element of the input array is "c", which is an ASCII character, so it is added to the result array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ["a", "b", "c"] is ["a", "c"].
<<<Output>>>
["a", "c"]
