Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, values):
    array.reverse()
    for value in values:
        array.insert(len(array) // 2, value)
    array.reverse()
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([58], [21, 92])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, an array and a list of values.
The first line of the function reverses the array.
The second line of the function iterates over the values and inserts them into the array at the middle index of the array.
The third line of the function reverses the array again.
Finally, the function returns the modified array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [58] and [21, 92], we need to reverse the array [58] to get [85], then insert the values [21, 92] into the middle index of the array [85] to get [85, 21, 92], and finally reverse the array again to get [92, 21, 85].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [58] and [21, 92] is [92, 21, 85].
<<<Output>>>
[92, 21, 85]
