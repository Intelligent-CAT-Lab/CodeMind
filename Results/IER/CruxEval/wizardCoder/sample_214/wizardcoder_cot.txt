Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(sample):
    i = -1
    while sample.find('/', i+1)!= -1:
        i = sample.find('/', i+1)
    return sample.rindex('/', 0, i)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('present/here/car%2Fwe')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string sample as input and returns the index of the last occurrence of the character '/' in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'present/here/car%2Fwe', we need to find the index of the last occurrence of the character '/' in the string.
The string 'present/here/car%2Fwe' is first decoded using the urldecode() function to convert the %2F character to the '/' character.
The function then finds the index of the last occurrence of the character '/' in the string using the rindex() method.
The rindex() method searches for the character '/' in the string starting from the end of the string and ending at the index i.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'present/here/car%2Fwe' is 21.
<<<Output>>>
21
