Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(line, char):
    count = line.count(char)
    for i in range(count+1, 0, -1):
        line = line.center(len(line)+i // len(char), char)
    return line
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('$78'.upper(), '$')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, line and char.
The line parameter is a string that represents a line of text.
The char parameter is a string that represents a single character.

The function first counts the number of occurrences of the character char in the line.

Next, the function uses a loop to iterate over the range of numbers from count+1 to 1, in reverse order.
For each number i, the function uses the center() method to add i // len(char) occurrences of the character char to the center of the line.

Finally, the function returns the modified line.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "$78".upper(), '$', we need to count the number of occurrences of '$' in the uppercase version of '$78'.

The uppercase version of '$78' is '$78'.upper().

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "$78".upper(), '$', is:

'$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$78$
