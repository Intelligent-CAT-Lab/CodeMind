Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    new_text = []
    for character in text:
        if character.isupper():
            new_text.insert(len(new_text) // 2, character)
    if len(new_text) == 0:
        new_text = ['-']
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('String matching is a big part of RexEx library.')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string with the uppercase characters in the input string inserted in the middle of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "String matching is a big part of RexEx library.", we need to insert the uppercase characters in the input string in the middle of the string.
The uppercase characters in the input string are "S", "M", "R", "X", "E", "G", "I", "L", "B", "P", "T", "A", "N", "H", "Y", "W".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "String matching is a big part of RexEx library." is "S-M-R-X-E-G-I-L-B-P-T-A-N-H-Y-W-S-M-R-X-E-G-I-L-B-P-T-A-N-H-Y-W".
<<<Output>>>
'S-M-R-X-E-G-I-L-B-P-T-A-N-H-Y-W-S-M-R-X-E-G-I-L-B-P-T-A-N-H-Y-W'
