Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, value):
    if isinstance(value, str):
        return text.count(value) + text.count(value.lower())
    return text.count(value)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('eftw{ьТсk_1', '\\')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and value.
The first if statement checks if the value is a string. If it is, it returns the sum of the counts of the value and its lowercase version in the text.
If the value is not a string, it returns the count of the value in the text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "eftw{ьТсk_1" and "\", we need to count the number of occurrences of "\\" and "\\\\", which are both present in the text.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "eftw{ьТсk_1" and "\\" is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
