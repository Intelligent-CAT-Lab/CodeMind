Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, separator):
    splitted = text.splitlines()
    if separator:
        return [' '.join(s) for s in splitted]
    else:
        return splitted
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('dga nqdk\rull qcha kl', 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and separator.
The text parameter is a string that contains multiple lines of text.
The separator parameter is a boolean value that determines whether to split the text into lines or to split each line into words.

If the separator parameter is True, the function splits the text into lines and then joins each line into a single string using a space as the separator.
If the separator parameter is False, the function splits each line of the text into words and returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains the words of a single line.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "dga nqdk\rull qcha kl" and separator 1, we need to split the text into lines and then join each line into a single string using a space as the separator.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "dga nqdk\rull qcha kl" and separator 1 is:
```
['dga nqdk', 'ull qcha', 'kl']
```

If the separator parameter is False, the function splits each line of the text into words and returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains the words of a single line.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "dga nqdk\rull qcha kl" and separator 0, we need to split each line of the text into words and return a list of lists, where each inner list contains the words of a single line.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "dga nqdk\rull qcha kl" and separator 0 is:
```
[['dga', 'nqdk'], ['ull', 'qcha'], ['kl']]
```

<<<Output>>>
```
['dga nqdk', 'ull qcha', 'kl']
```
