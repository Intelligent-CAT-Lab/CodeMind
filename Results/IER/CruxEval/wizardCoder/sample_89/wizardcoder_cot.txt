Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(char):
    if char not in 'aeiouAEIOU':
        return None
    if char in 'AEIOU':
        return char.lower()
    return char.upper()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('o')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a character char as input and returns the corresponding vowel in lowercase or uppercase.
The function first checks if the input character is a vowel or not. If it is not a vowel, it returns None.
If the input character is a vowel, it checks if it is an uppercase or lowercase vowel. If it is an uppercase vowel, it returns the lowercase vowel. If it is a lowercase vowel, it returns the uppercase vowel.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'o', we need to check if 'o' is a vowel or not. 'o' is a lowercase vowel, so the output of executing the function f on the input 'o' is 'o'.
<<<Output>>>
'o'
