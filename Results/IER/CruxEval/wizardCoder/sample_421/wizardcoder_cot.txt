Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(str, n):
    if len(str) < n:
        return str
    else:
        return str.removeprefix(str[:n])
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("try.", 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, str and n.
The first if statement checks if the length of the string is less than n.
If it is, then the function returns the original string.
If it is not, then the function removes the first n characters of the string using the removeprefix() method.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "try." and n=5, we need to check if the length of "try." is less than 5.
Since it is not, then the function removes the first 5 characters of "try." using the removeprefix() method.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "try." and n=5 is "try".
<<<Output>>>
'try'
