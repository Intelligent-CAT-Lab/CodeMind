Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    t = 5
    tab = []
    for i in text:
        if i.lower() in 'aeiouy':
            tab.append(i.upper() * t)
        else:
            tab.append(i * t)
    return''.join(tab)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('csharp')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string.
The variable t is initialized to 5.
The variable tab is initialized as an empty list.
The for loop iterates over each character in the string text.
If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y), the character is converted to uppercase and repeated t times and appended to the list tab.
If the character is not a vowel, the character is repeated t times and appended to the list tab.
The list tab is then joined into a single string using the join method with a space as the separator.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "csharp", we need to apply the above steps to each character in the string "csharp".
The first character is "c", which is not a vowel, so it is repeated 5 times and appended to the list tab as "ccccc".
The second character is "s", which is a vowel, so it is converted to uppercase and repeated 5 times and appended to the list tab as "SSSSS".
The third character is "h", which is not a vowel, so it is repeated 5 times and appended to the list tab as "hhhhh".
The fourth character is "r", which is a vowel, so it is converted to uppercase and repeated 5 times and appended to the list tab as "RRRRR".
The fifth character is "p", which is not a vowel, so it is repeated 5 times and appended to the list tab as "ppppp".
The list tab is then joined into a single string using the join method with a space as the separator, resulting in the output "ccccc SSSSS hhhhh RRRRR ppppp".
<<<Output>>>
'ccccc SSSSS hhhhh RRRRR ppppp'
