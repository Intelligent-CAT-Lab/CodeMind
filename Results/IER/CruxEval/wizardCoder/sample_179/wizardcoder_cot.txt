Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    # Pass in a copy to avoid modifying nums
    nums = nums[:]
    count = len(nums)
    for i in range(-count+1, 0):
        nums.insert(0, nums[i])
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The function creates a copy of the input list using the slicing operator [:].
The function initializes a variable count to the length of the input list.
The function iterates over the range of indices from -count+1 to 0 (inclusive) using the for loop.
For each index i, the function inserts the value at index i into the beginning of the list using the insert() method.
Finally, the function returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2], we need to create a copy of the input list, [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2], using the slicing operator [:].
The length of the copy is 6.
The function then iterates over the range of indices from -6+1 to 0 (inclusive) and inserts the value at each index into the beginning of the list.
The resulting list is [2, 6, 0, 2, 7, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[2, 6, 0, 2, 7, 1]
