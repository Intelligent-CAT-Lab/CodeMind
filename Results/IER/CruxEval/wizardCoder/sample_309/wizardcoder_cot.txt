Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, suffix):
    text += suffix
    while text[-len(suffix):] == suffix:
        text = text[:-1]
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('faqo osax f', 'f')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and suffix.
The function adds the suffix to the end of the text using the += operator.
The function then checks if the last len(suffix) characters of the text are the same as the suffix.
If they are, the function removes the last character from the text using the text[:-1] syntax.
The function continues to remove characters from the end of the text until it no longer ends with the suffix.
Finally, the function returns the modified text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "faqo osax f" and suffix "f", we need to add "f" to the end of the text "faqo osax f".
Then, we need to remove the last character from the text "faqo osax" until it no longer ends with "f".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "faqo osax f" and suffix "f" is "faqo osax".
<<<Output>>>
'faqo osax'
