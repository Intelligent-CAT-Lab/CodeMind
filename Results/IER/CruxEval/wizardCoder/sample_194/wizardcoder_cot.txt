Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(matr, insert_loc):
    matr.insert(insert_loc, [])
    return matr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([[5, 6, 2, 3], [1, 9, 5, 6]], 0)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a matrix matr and an integer insert_loc.
The matrix matr is a list of lists, and the integer insert_loc specifies the index where the new list should be inserted.
The function inserts a new empty list at the specified index and returns the modified matrix.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [[5, 6, 2, 3], [1, 9, 5, 6]], 0), we need to insert an empty list at index 0 of the matrix.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [[5, 6, 2, 3], [1, 9, 5, 6]], 0) is [[], [5, 6, 2, 3], [1, 9, 5, 6]].
<<<Output>>>
[[], [5, 6, 2, 3], [1, 9, 5, 6]]
