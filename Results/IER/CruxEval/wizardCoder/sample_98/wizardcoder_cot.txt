Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return sum([s.istitle() for s in s.split()])
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the sum of the boolean values of each word in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!", we need to split the string into words, and then check if each word is title case.
The boolean values of each word are 1 if the word is title case, and 0 otherwise.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!" is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
