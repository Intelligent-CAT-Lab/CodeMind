Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, chars):
    num_applies = 2
    extra_chars = ''
    for i in range(num_applies):
        extra_chars += chars
        text = text.replace(extra_chars, '')
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('zbzquiuqnmfkx','mk')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and chars.
The variable num_applies is set to 2.
The variable extra_chars is initialized as an empty string.
The for loop iterates num_applies times, adding chars to extra_chars each time.
The replace method is used to remove the extra_chars from the text.
The function returns the modified text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "zbzquiuqnmfkx" and "mk", we need to apply the replace method twice on the input text.
The first time, we remove the characters "mk" from the text.
The second time, we remove the characters "mkmk" from the modified text.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "zbzquiuqnmfkx" and "mk" is "zbzquiuqnmfkx".
<<<Output>>>
'zbzquiuqnmfkx'
