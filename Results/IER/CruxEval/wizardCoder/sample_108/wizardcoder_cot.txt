Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(var):
    amount = len(var) if type(var) == list else 0
    if type(var) == dict:
        amount = len(var.keys())
    nonzero = amount if amount > 0 else 0
    return nonzero
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a variable var as input.
If var is a list, the function calculates the length of the list and assigns it to the variable amount.
If var is a dictionary, the function calculates the number of keys in the dictionary and assigns it to the variable amount.
If amount is greater than 0, the function assigns amount to the variable nonzero.
If amount is not greater than 0, the function assigns 0 to the variable nonzero.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1, we need to check the type of the input.
Since 1 is not a list or a dictionary, the function assigns 0 to the variable amount.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 is 0.
<<<Output>>>0
