Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(length, text):
    if len(text) == length:
        return text[::-1]
    return False
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(-5, 'G5ogb6f,c7e.EMm')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, length and text.
The length argument is an integer that specifies the length of the desired output.
The text argument is a string that is the input to the function.

If the length of the input text is equal to the length argument, the function returns the reverse of the input text.
Otherwise, the function returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (-5, 'G5ogb6f,c7e.EMm'), we need to check if the length of the input text is equal to -5.
Since the length of the input text is 22, which is not equal to -5, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
