Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(strand, zmnc):
    poz = strand.find(zmnc)
    while poz!= -1:
        strand = strand[poz + 1:]
        poz = strand.find(zmnc)
    return strand.rfind(zmnc)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('', 'abc')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, strand and zmnc.
The function initializes a variable poz to the index of the first occurrence of zmnc in strand.
The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as poz is not equal to -1.
Inside the while loop, the function removes the first occurrence of zmnc from strand by slicing the string from the index poz + 1 to the end.
The function then updates poz to the index of the next occurrence of zmnc in the updated strand.
The function continues the while loop until poz is equal to -1, indicating that all occurrences of zmnc have been removed from strand.
Finally, the function returns the index of the last occurrence of zmnc in the updated strand.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('', 'abc'), we need to remove all occurrences of 'abc' from the empty string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('', 'abc') is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
