Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(bots):
    clean = []
    for username in bots:
        if not username.isupper():
            clean.append(username[:2] + username[-3:])
    return len(clean)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['yR?TAJhIW?n', 'o11BgEFDfoe', 'KnHdn2vdEd', 'wvwruuqfhXbGis'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns the number of strings in the list that are clean.
To determine the clean strings, we iterate through the list of strings and check if each string is in uppercase. If it is not in uppercase, we append the first two characters and the last three characters of the string to a new list called clean.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['yR?TAJhIW?n', 'o11BgEFDfoe', 'KnHdn2vdEd', 'wvwruuqfhXbGis'] is 2.
<<<Output>>>2
