Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, verdict):
    res = [x for x in nums if x!= 0]
    result = [[x, verdict(x)] for x in res]
    if result:
        return result
    return 'error - no numbers or all zeros!'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([0, 3, 0, 1], lambda x: x < 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of numbers nums and a function verdict.
The list nums contains 0, 3, 0, and 1.
The function verdict takes a number x as input and returns True if x is less than 2, and False otherwise.
The code creates a new list res by filtering out the zeros from nums.
The new list res contains 3 and 1.
The code then creates a new list result by mapping each number in res to a list containing the number and the result of applying the verdict function to the number.
The new list result contains [[3, False], [1, True]].
Finally, the code checks if the list result is not empty. If it is not empty, it returns the list result. Otherwise, it returns the string 'error - no numbers or all zeros!'.
<<<Output>>>
[[3, False], [1, True]]
