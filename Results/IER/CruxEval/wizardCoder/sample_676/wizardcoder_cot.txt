Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, tab_size):
    return text.replace('\t',''*tab_size)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('a', 100)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and tab_size.
The text parameter is a string that contains tabs.
The tab_size parameter is an integer that specifies the number of spaces to replace each tab with.
The function replaces each tab in the text string with a string of spaces equal to the tab_size parameter.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "a" and tab_size 100, we need to replace each tab in the string "a" with a string of spaces equal to 100.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "a" and tab_size 100 is "        a".
<<<Output>>>
'        a'
