Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(c, st, ed):
    d = {}
    a, b = 0, 0
    for x, y in c.items():
        d[y] = x
        if y == st:
            a = x
        if y == ed:
            b = x
    w = d[st]
    return (w, b) if a > b else (b, w)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'TEXT': 7, 'CODE': 3}, 7, 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary c, starting index st, and ending index ed as input.
The function creates an empty dictionary d to store the key-value pairs of c.
The function initializes two variables a and b to 0.
The function loops through the items of c and stores the key-value pairs in d.
The function checks if the key of the current item is equal to st or ed.
If the key is equal to st, the function updates the value of a to the current key.
If the key is equal to ed, the function updates the value of b to the current key.
The function retrieves the value of the key corresponding to the starting index st from d.
The function retrieves the value of the key corresponding to the ending index ed from d.
The function returns a tuple containing the values of w and b, based on the comparison of a and b.
<<<Output>>>The return value of the code is (7, 3).
