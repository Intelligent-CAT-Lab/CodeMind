Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    new = list()
    i = len(lst)-1
    for _ in range(len(lst)):
        if i%2 == 0:
            new.append(-lst[i])
        else:
            new.append(lst[i])
        i -= 1
    return new
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 7, -1, -3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and returns a new list new.
The new list is initialized as an empty list.
The loop iterates over the length of the input list lst.
For each iteration, the loop checks if the index i is even or odd.
If i is even, the element at index i is appended to the new list with a negative sign.
If i is odd, the element at index i is appended to the new list without a negative sign.
Finally, the loop decrements i by 1 and repeats the process until all elements of the input list have been processed.
The output of executing the function f on the input [1, 7, -1, -3] is [-1, 7, -1, -3].
<<<Output>>>
[-1, 7, -1, -3]
