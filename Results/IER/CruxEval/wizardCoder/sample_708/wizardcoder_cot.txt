Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    l = list(string)
    for i in reversed(range(len(l))):
        if l[i]!='':
            break
        l.pop(i)
    return ''.join(l)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('    jcmfxv     ')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and returns a new string with all the leading spaces removed from the original string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input'   jcmfxv     ', we need to remove all the leading spaces from the string.
The string'   jcmfxv    'has 6 leading spaces and 9 trailing spaces.
We can remove all the leading spaces by iterating over the string in reverse order and removing the first space we encounter.
The resulting string will be 'jcmfxv     '.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input'   jcmfxv    'is 'jcmfxv     '.
<<<Output>>>
'jcmfxv     '
