Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(dict):
    result = dict.copy()
    remove_keys = []
    for k, v in dict.items():
        if v in dict:
            del result[k]
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({-1: -1, 5: 5, 3: 6, -4: -4})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary with the same key-value pairs as the input dictionary, except for those keys that have the same value as another key in the dictionary.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {-1: -1, 5: 5, 3: 6, -4: -4}, we need to remove the key-value pairs where the value is the same as another key in the dictionary.
The input dictionary has the following key-value pairs: {-1: -1, 5: 5, 3: 6, -4: -4}.
The first step is to create a copy of the input dictionary using the copy() method.
The resulting dictionary is: {5: 5, 3: 6}.
The second step is to create an empty list to store the keys to be removed.
The third step is to iterate over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary using the items() method.
For each key-value pair, if the value is the same as another key in the dictionary, the key is added to the remove_keys list.
The fourth step is to remove the keys from the resulting dictionary using the del statement.
The resulting dictionary is: {5: 5}.
The final step is to return the resulting dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{5: 5}
