Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    return ', '.join(text.splitlines())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("BYE\nNO\nWAY")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the concatenation of the elements of the list obtained by splitting the input string into lines using the splitlines() method and then joining the elements of the list using the join() method with a comma and a space as the separator.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "BYE\nNO\nWAY", we need to split the input string into lines using the splitlines() method, which gives us the list ["BYE", "NO", "WAY"].
Then we join the elements of the list using the join() method with a comma and a space as the separator, which gives us the string "BYE, NO, WAY".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "BYE\nNO\nWAY" is "BYE, NO, WAY".
<<<Output>>>
'BYE, NO, WAY'
