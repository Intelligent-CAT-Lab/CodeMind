Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(label1, char, label2, index):
    m = label1.rindex(char)
    if m >= index:
        return label2[:m - index + 1]
    return label1 + label2[index - m - 1:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ekwies','s', 'rpg', 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes four parameters: label1, char, label2, and index.
The function first finds the last index of the character's' in the string 'ekwies' using the rindex() method.
If the last index of's' is greater than or equal to the index parameter, then the function returns the substring of 'rpg' starting from the index position minus the last index of's' plus one.
Otherwise, the function returns the concatenation of 'ekwies' and the substring of 'rpg' starting from the index position minus the last index of's' minus one.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ekwies','s', 'rpg', and 1, we need to find the last index of's' in 'ekwies' using rindex().
The last index of's' in 'ekwies' is 3.
Since 3 is greater than or equal to 1, the function returns the substring of 'rpg' starting from the index position minus the last index of's' plus one, which is 'r'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ekwies','s', 'rpg', and 1 is 'r'.
<<<Output>>>
'r'
