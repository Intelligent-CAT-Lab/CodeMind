Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(multi_string):
    cond_string = map(str.isascii, multi_string.split())
    if True in cond_string:
        return ', '.join(x for x in multi_string.split() if x.isascii())
    return ''
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('I am hungry! eat food.')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a multi-line string as input and returns a string.
The first step is to split the multi-line string into a list of words using the split() method.
The second step is to use the map() function to apply the isascii() method to each word in the list.
The isascii() method returns True if the word contains only ASCII characters, and False otherwise.
The third step is to use the any() function to check if any of the words in the list is ASCII.
If any of the words is ASCII, the function returns a string that is the concatenation of the words in the list that are ASCII, separated by commas.
If none of the words is ASCII, the function returns an empty string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "I am hungry! eat food.", we need to split the input into a list of words, apply the isascii() method to each word, and concatenate the words that are ASCII, separated by commas.
The list of words is: ['I', 'am', 'hungry!', 'eat', 'food.']
The list of words that are ASCII is: ['I', 'am', 'eat', 'food.']
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "I am hungry! eat food." is "I, am, eat, food.".
<<<Output>>>
'I, am, eat, food.'
