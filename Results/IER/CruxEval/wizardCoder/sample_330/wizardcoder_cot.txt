Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    ans = []
    for char in text:
        if char.isdigit():
            ans.append(char)
        else:
            ans.append(' ')
    return ''.join(ans)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('m4n2o')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string where all the digits in the input string are replaced with spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "m4n2o", we need to iterate over each character in the input string and check if it is a digit. If it is a digit, we append it to a new list called ans. If it is not a digit, we append a space to the ans list. Finally, we join the elements of the ans list to form a new string and return it.
The output of executing the function f on the input "m4n2o" is "m n o".
<<<Output>>>
'm n o'
