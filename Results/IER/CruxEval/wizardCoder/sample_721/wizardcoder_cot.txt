Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    count = len(nums)
    for num in range(2, count):
        nums.sort()
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-6, -5, -7, -8, 2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The variable count is initialized to the length of the nums list.
The for loop iterates over the range of 2 to count-1.
Inside the loop, the nums list is sorted in ascending order.
The sorted nums list is returned as the output of the function.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-6, -5, -7, -8, 2], we need to sort the list [-6, -5, -7, -8, 2] in ascending order.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-6, -5, -7, -8, 2] is [-8, -7, -6, -5, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[-8, -7, -6, -5, 2]
