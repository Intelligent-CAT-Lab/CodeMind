Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    for idx, e in enumerate(array):
        if e > elem and array[idx - 1] < elem:
            array.insert(idx, elem)
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3, 5, 8], 6)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, an array and an element elem.
The function iterates over the elements of the array using a for loop and checks if each element is greater than the given element elem and the previous element is less than the given element elem.
If both conditions are true, the function inserts the given element elem at the index where the conditions are true.
Finally, the function returns the modified array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 5, 8] and 6, we need to insert 6 at the index where the conditions are true.
The first element of the array is 1, which is less than 6, so the function does not insert 6 at the beginning of the array.
The second element of the array is 2, which is greater than 6 and the previous element is 1, which is less than 6, so the function inserts 6 at index 1.
The third element of the array is 3, which is greater than 6 and the previous element is 2, which is less than 6, so the function inserts 6 at index 2.
The fourth element of the array is 5, which is greater than 6 and the previous element is 3, which is less than 6, so the function inserts 6 at index 3.
The fifth element of the array is 8, which is greater than 6 and the previous element is 5, which is less than 6, so the function inserts 6 at index 4.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 5, 8] and 6 is [1, 6, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 6, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8]
