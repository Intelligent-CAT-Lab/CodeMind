Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(val, text):
    indices = [index for index in range(len(text)) if text[index] == val]
    if len(indices) == 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return indices[0]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('o', 'fnmart')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, val and text.
The variable val is the character we are looking for in the text.
The variable text is the string we are searching in.

The function creates a list of indices where the character val appears in the text.
If the list is empty, the function returns -1.
Otherwise, the function returns the first index in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('o', 'fnmart'), we need to find the index of the first occurrence of the character 'o' in the string 'fnmart'.

The character 'o' appears at index 4 in the string 'fnmart'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('o', 'fnmart') is 4.
<<<Output>>>4
