Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    chars = []
    for c in text:
        if c.isdigit():
            chars.append(c)
    return ''.join(chars[::-1])
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('--4yrw 251-//4 6p')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string that contains only the digits of the input string in reverse order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "--4yrw 251-//4 6p", we need to extract the digits from the input string and append them to a list. Then, we need to reverse the list and join the digits to form a string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "--4yrw 251-//4 6p" is "46251".
<<<Output>>>
'46251'
