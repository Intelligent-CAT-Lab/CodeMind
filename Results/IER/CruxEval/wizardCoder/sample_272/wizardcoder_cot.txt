Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(base_list, nums):
    base_list.extend(nums)
    res = base_list.copy()
    for i in range(-len(nums), 0):
        res.append(res[i])
    return res
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([9, 7, 5, 3, 1], [2, 4, 6, 8, 0])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, base_list and nums.
The base_list is a list of integers, and nums is a list of integers.
The function first extends the base_list with the elements of nums using the extend method.
The function then creates a copy of the base_list using the copy method.
The function then iterates over the range from -len(nums) to 0 (inclusive) and appends the element at index i to the copy of the base_list.
Finally, the function returns the copy of the base_list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([9, 7, 5, 3, 1], [2, 4, 6, 8, 0]), we need to extend the list [9, 7, 5, 3, 1] with the elements of [2, 4, 6, 8, 0], create a copy of the extended list, and then append the elements of the copy to the copy in reverse order.

The output of executing the function f on the input ([9, 7, 5, 3, 1], [2, 4, 6, 8, 0]) is [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9].
<<<Output>>>
[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
