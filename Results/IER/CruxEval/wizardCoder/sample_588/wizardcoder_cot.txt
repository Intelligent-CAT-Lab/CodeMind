Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(items, target):
    if target in items:
        return items.index(target)
    return -1
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['''1''', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+'], '**')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, items and target.
The items argument is a list of strings representing mathematical operations.
The target argument is a string representing a mathematical operation.

The function checks if the target is present in the items list using the "in" operator.
If the target is present, the function returns the index of the target in the items list using the "index" method.
If the target is not present, the function returns -1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['''1''', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+'], '**', we need to check if '**' is present in the items list.
The items list contains the mathematical operations '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', and '+'.
'**' is not present in the items list, so the function returns -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
