Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, characters):
    character_list = list(characters) + [' ', '_']

    i = 0
    while i < len(text) and text[i] in character_list:
        i += 1

    return text[i:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("2nm_28in", "nm")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, text and characters.
The characters argument is converted to a list of characters and the list is concatenated with a list containing'' and '_'.
The function then iterates through the text string, starting from the first character, and checks if the current character is in the list of allowed characters.
If the current character is in the list of allowed characters, the iteration continues.
If the current character is not in the list of allowed characters, the iteration stops and the function returns the substring of the text string starting from the current position.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "2nm_28in" and "nm", we need to iterate through the text string starting from the first character and stop when we encounter the first character that is not in the list of allowed characters.
The first character that is not in the list of allowed characters is the'm' in "2nm_28in".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "2nm_28in" and "nm" is "2nm_28in".
<<<Output>>>
'2nm_28in'
