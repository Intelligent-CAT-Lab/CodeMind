Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(seq, v):
    a = []
    for i in seq:
        if i.endswith(v):
            a.append(i*2)
    return a
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([ 'oH', 'ee','mb', 'deft', 'n', 'zz', 'f', 'abA' ], 'zz')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a sequence seq and a string v.
The function creates an empty list a to store the modified strings.
The function iterates over each element i in the sequence seq.
If the element i ends with the string v, the function appends the string i repeated twice to the list a.
Finally, the function returns the list a.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [ 'oH', 'ee','mb', 'deft', 'n', 'zz', 'f', 'abA' ], 'zz', we need to apply the function f on the input sequence and the string 'zz'.

The function f iterates over the sequence [ 'oH', 'ee','mb', 'deft', 'n', 'zz', 'f', 'abA' ] and checks if each element ends with the string 'zz'.

The first element 'oH' does not end with 'zz', so it is not appended to the list a.
The second element 'ee' does not end with 'zz', so it is not appended to the list a.
The third element'mb' does not end with 'zz', so it is not appended to the list a.
The fourth element 'deft' does not end with 'zz', so it is not appended to the list a.
The fifth element 'n' does not end with 'zz', so it is not appended to the list a.
The sixth element 'zz' does end with 'zz', so it is appended to the list a as 'zzzz'.
The seventh element 'f' does not end with 'zz', so it is not appended to the list a.
The eighth element 'abA' does not end with 'zz', so it is not appended to the list a.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [ 'oH', 'ee','mb', 'deft', 'n', 'zz', 'f', 'abA' ], 'zz' is [ 'zzzz' ].
<<<Output>>>
[ 'zzzz' ]
