Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(line, equalityMap):
    rs = {
        k[0]: k[1] for k in equalityMap
    }
    return line.translate(str.maketrans(rs))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('abab', [('a', 'b'), ('b', 'a')])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, line and equalityMap.
The equalityMap is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two strings.
The function creates a dictionary rs by iterating over the tuples in equalityMap and using the first string as the key and the second string as the value.
The function then uses the translate method of the string line to replace all occurrences of the keys in rs with their corresponding values.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "abab" and the equalityMap [('a', 'b'), ('b', 'a')], we need to replace all occurrences of 'a' with 'b' and all occurrences of 'b' with 'a'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "abab" and the equalityMap [('a', 'b'), ('b', 'a')] is "bbba".
<<<Output>>>
'bbba'
