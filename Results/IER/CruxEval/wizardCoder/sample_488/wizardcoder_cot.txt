Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    count = text.count(char)
    chars = list(text)
    if count > 0:
        index = chars.index(char) + 1
        chars[:index:index+1] = [c for c in chars[index:index+count:1]]
    return ''.join(chars)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('tezmgvn 651h', '6')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and char.
The first line of the function counts the number of occurrences of the character char in the string text.
The second line of the function converts the string text to a list of characters.
The third line of the function checks if the count is greater than 0. If it is, it finds the index of the first occurrence of the character char in the list of characters.
The fourth line of the function replaces the characters from the index of the first occurrence of the character char to the index of the first occurrence of the character char plus the count of occurrences of the character char with the character char repeated count times.
The fifth line of the function converts the list of characters back to a string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "tezmgvn 651h" and the character '6', we need to replace the characters '6' with '6' repeated 3 times.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "tezmgvn 651h" and the character '6' is "tezmgvn 666h".
<<<Output>>>
'tezmgvn 666h'
