Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, target):
    cnt = nums.count(target)
    return cnt * 2
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 1], 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, nums and target.
The nums argument is a list of integers, and the target argument is an integer.
The function counts the number of occurrences of the target integer in the nums list using the count() method.
The count() method returns the number of occurrences of the target integer in the nums list.
The function returns the count of the target integer multiplied by 2.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1] and target 1, we need to count the number of occurrences of 1 in the list [1, 1], which is 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1] and target 1 is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
