Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1):
        if nums[i] % 2 == 0:
            nums.remove(nums[i])
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, 3, 3, 7])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The function iterates over the list of integers from the end to the beginning using a for loop.
For each integer in the list, the function checks if it is even or odd using the modulo operator (%).
If the integer is even, the function removes it from the list using the remove() method.
Finally, the function returns the modified list of integers.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 3, 3, 7], we need to remove the even integers from the list [5, 3, 3, 7] to get [5, 7].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 3, 3, 7] is [5, 7].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 7]
