Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(d, get_ary):
    result = []
    for key in get_ary:
        result.append(d.get(key))
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({3: "swims like a bull"}, [3, 2, 'c', True, 5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a dictionary d and a list get_ary.
The dictionary d has keys 3 and "c" and values "swims like a bull" and None respectively.
The list get_ary has elements 3, 2, 'c', True, 5.

The function f initializes an empty list result.

The function f iterates over the elements of the list get_ary using a for loop.
For each element, the function f retrieves the corresponding value from the dictionary d using the get() method.
The get() method returns the value associated with the given key if it exists in the dictionary, otherwise it returns None.
The retrieved values are appended to the list result.

Finally, the function f returns the list result.

The output of executing the function f on the input {3: "swims like a bull"}, [3, 2, 'c', True, 5] is [None,'swims like a bull', None, None, None].

<<<Output>>>
[None,'swims like a bull', None, None, None]
