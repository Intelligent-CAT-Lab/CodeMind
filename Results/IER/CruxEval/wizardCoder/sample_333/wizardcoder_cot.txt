Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(places, lazy):
    places.sort()
    for lazy in lazy:
        places.remove(lazy)
    if len(places) == 1:
        return 1
    for i, place in enumerate(places):
        if places.count(place+1) == 0:
            return i+1
    return i+1
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([375, 564, 857, 90, 728, 92], [728])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, places and lazy.
The first line of the function sorts the list places in ascending order.
The second line of the function removes all occurrences of lazy from the list places.
The third line of the function checks if the length of the list places is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns 1.
The fourth line of the function iterates over the list places using the enumerate function.
The fifth line of the function checks if the number of occurrences of the next place in the list places is equal to 0. If it is, the function returns the index of the next place.
The sixth line of the function returns the index of the last place in the list places.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [375, 564, 857, 90, 728, 92], [728], we need to sort the list [375, 564, 857, 90, 728, 92] to [90, 375, 564, 728, 857, 92], remove the element 728 from the list, and then check if the length of the list is equal to 1. Since the length of the list is not equal to 1, we need to iterate over the list and check if the number of occurrences of the next place is equal to 0. Since the number of occurrences of the next place is not equal to 0 for the first place (90), the function returns 1.
<<<Output>>>
