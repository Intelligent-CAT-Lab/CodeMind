Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(str, char):
    base = char * (str.count(char) + 1)
    return str.removesuffix(base)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('mnmnj krupa...##!@#!@#$$@##', '@')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, str and char.
The base variable is created by multiplying the char parameter with the count of char in the str parameter plus one.
The removesuffix method is used to remove the base string from the str parameter.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input'mnmnj krupa...##!@#!@#$$@##' and '@', we need to count the number of '@' in the input string and multiply it by '@' to create the base string. Then we need to remove the base string from the input string using the removesuffix method.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input'mnmnj krupa...##!@#!@#$$@##' and '@' is'mnmnj krupa...##!@#!@#$$@##'.
<<<Output>>>
'mnmnj krupa...##!@#!@#$$@##'
