Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, pref):
    length = len(pref)
    if pref == text[:length]:
        return text[length:]
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('kumwwfv', 'k')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and pref.
The length of pref is calculated using the len() function.
If pref is equal to the first length characters of text, then the function returns the substring starting from the length+1th character of text.
Otherwise, the function returns the original text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "kumwwfv" and "k", we need to check if "k" is a prefix of "kumwwfv".
Since "k" is a prefix of "kumwwfv", the function returns the substring starting from the 2nd character of "kumwwfv", which is "umwwfv".
<<<Output>>>
'umwwfv'
