Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for odd in nums[:]:
        if odd % 2!= 0:
            nums.remove(odd)
    sum_ = 0
    for num in nums:
        sum_ += num
    return sum_
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([11, 21, 0, 11])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The first line of the function creates a copy of the input list using slicing.
The second line of the function iterates over the odd numbers in the copy of the input list.
The third line of the function checks if the current odd number is not divisible by 2.
If it is not divisible by 2, the function removes the current odd number from the copy of the input list.
The fourth line of the function initializes a variable sum_ to 0.
The fifth line of the function iterates over the remaining numbers in the copy of the input list.
The sixth line of the function adds each remaining number to the sum_.
The seventh line of the function returns the sum_.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [11, 21, 0, 11], we need to remove the odd number 0 and the duplicate number 11.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [11, 21, 0, 11] is 32.
<<<Output>>>32
