Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(strings, substr):
    list = [s for s in strings if s.startswith(substr)]
    return sorted(list, key=len)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['condor', 'eyes', 'gay', 'isa' ], 'd')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, strings and substr.
The strings argument is a list of strings.
The substr argument is a string.

The function creates a new list by iterating over the strings in the input list and selecting only those strings that start with the substring substr.

The function then sorts the new list in ascending order based on the length of the strings.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['condor', 'eyes', 'gay', 'isa' ], 'd', we need to create a new list by selecting only those strings that start with the substring 'd', which is ['condor', 'gay'].

The function then sorts the new list in ascending order based on the length of the strings, which gives us ['gay', 'condor'].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['condor', 'eyes', 'gay', 'isa' ], 'd' is ['gay', 'condor'].
<<<Output>>>
['gay', 'condor']
