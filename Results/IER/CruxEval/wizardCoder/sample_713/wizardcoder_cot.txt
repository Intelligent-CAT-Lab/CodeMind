Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    if char in text:
        text = [t.strip() for t in text.split(char) if t]
        if len(text) > 1:
            return True
    return False
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('only one line','')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and char.
The if statement checks if the char is present in the text.
If the char is present, the text is split into a list of strings using the char as the delimiter.
The list comprehension removes any empty strings from the list.
If the length of the list is greater than 1, the function returns True.
If the char is not present or the length of the list is 1, the function returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "only one line" and the delimiter'', we need to split the text into a list of strings using the delimiter''.
The list comprehension removes any empty strings from the list.
The length of the list is 1, so the function returns False.

<<<Output>>>
False
