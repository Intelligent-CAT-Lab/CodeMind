Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(dct):
    lst = []
    for key in sorted(dct):
        lst.append((key, dct[key]))
    return lst
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary dct as input and returns a list of tuples.
The list contains a tuple for each key-value pair in the dictionary, sorted by the keys in ascending order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, we need to create a list of tuples containing the key-value pairs in the dictionary, sorted by the keys in ascending order.
The list of tuples would be: [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)].
<<<Output>>>
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
