Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, index, value):
    array.insert(0, index + 1)
    if value >= 1:
        array.insert(index, value)
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([2], 0, 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: array, index, and value.
The array parameter is a list of integers.
The index parameter is an integer representing the index at which the value should be inserted.
The value parameter is an integer representing the value to be inserted.

The function first inserts the value of index + 1 at the beginning of the array.
Next, it checks if the value is greater than or equal to 1. If it is, it inserts the value at the index specified.
Finally, it returns the modified array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2], 0, 2, we need to insert 3 at the beginning of the array, and then insert 2 at index 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2], 0, 2 is [3, 2, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[3, 2, 2]
