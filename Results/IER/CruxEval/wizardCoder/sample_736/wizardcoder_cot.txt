Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, insert):
    whitespaces = {'\t', '\r', '\v','', '\f', '\n'}
    clean = ''
    for char in text:
        if char in whitespaces:
            clean += insert
        else:
            clean += char
    return clean
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('pi wa', 'chi')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and insert.
The function initializes an empty string clean.
The function iterates through each character in the text parameter.
If the character is a whitespace character, the insert parameter is added to the clean string.
Otherwise, the character is added to the clean string.
Finally, the clean string is returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "pi wa" and "chi", we need to iterate through each character in the text parameter.
The first character is "p", which is not a whitespace character. Therefore, it is added to the clean string.
The second character is "i", which is not a whitespace character. Therefore, it is added to the clean string.
The third character is "w", which is not a whitespace character. Therefore, it is added to the clean string.
The fourth character is "a", which is a whitespace character. Therefore, the insert parameter "chi" is added to the clean string.
The fifth character is " ", which is a whitespace character. Therefore, the insert parameter "chi" is added to the clean string.
The sixth character is "c", which is not a whitespace character. Therefore, it is added to the clean string.
The seventh character is "h", which is not a whitespace character. Therefore, it is added to the clean string.
The eighth character is "i", which is not a whitespace character. Therefore, it is added to the clean string.
The ninth character is " ", which is a whitespace character. Therefore, the insert parameter "chi" is added to the clean string.
The tenth character is "w", which is not a whitespace character. Therefore, it is added to the clean string.
The eleventh character is "a", which is not a whitespace character. Therefore, it is added to the clean string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "pi wa" and "chi" is "pichiwa".
<<<Output>>>
'pichiwa'
