Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    for i in range(len(text)-1):
        if text[i:].islower():
            return text[i + 1:]
    return ''
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('wrazugizoernmgzu')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and iterates over the characters of the string.
For each character, it checks if the substring starting from that character and ending at the end of the string is all lowercase.
If it is, it returns the substring starting from the next character and ending at the end of the string.
If none of the characters satisfy the condition, it returns an empty string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "wrazugizoernmgzu", we need to iterate over each character of the string and check if the substring starting from that character and ending at the end of the string is all lowercase.
The first character "w" satisfies the condition, so the function returns the substring starting from the next character "r" and ending at the end of the string "razugizoernmgzu".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "wrazugizoernmgzu" is "razugizoernmgzu".
<<<Output>>>
'razugizoernmgzu'
