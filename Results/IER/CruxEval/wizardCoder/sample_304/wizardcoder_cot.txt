Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(d):
    key1 = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)[0][0]
    val1 = d.pop(key1)
    key2 = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)[0][0]
    val2 = d.pop(key2)
    return dict({key1: val1, key2: val2})
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({2: 3, 17: 3, 16: 6, 18: 6, 87: 7})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input.
First, we sort the items of the dictionary d based on their keys in descending order using the sorted() function and a lambda function as the key parameter.
We then take the first key-value pair from the sorted list and assign it to key1 and val1.
Next, we remove the key-value pair with key1 from the dictionary d using the pop() method.
We repeat the same process for the second key-value pair, assigning it to key2 and val2.
Finally, we create a new dictionary with key1 and val1 as its key-value pairs and key2 and val2 as its key-value pairs.
The output of executing the function f on the input {2: 3, 17: 3, 16: 6, 18: 6, 87: 7} is {18: 6, 17: 3}.
<<<Output>>>
{18: 6, 17: 3}
