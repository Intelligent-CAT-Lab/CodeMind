Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(input_string):
    table = str.maketrans('aioe', 'ioua')
    while 'a' in input_string or 'A' in input_string:
        input_string = input_string.translate(table)
    return input_string
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('biec')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string input_string as input.
The function creates a translation table using the str.maketrans() method, which maps each character in the string 'aioe' to the corresponding character in the string 'ioua'.
The function then uses the translate() method to replace each occurrence of 'a' or 'A' in the input string with the corresponding character in the translation table.
The function repeats this process until there are no more occurrences of 'a' or 'A' in the input string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'biec', we need to replace each occurrence of 'a' or 'A' in the input string with the corresponding character in the translation table.
The first iteration of the while loop replaces 'a' with 'i', 'i' with 'o', and 'e' with 'u'.
The second iteration of the while loop replaces 'A' with 'i', 'i' with 'o', and 'e' with 'u'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'biec' is 'biceu'.
<<<Output>>>
'biceu'
