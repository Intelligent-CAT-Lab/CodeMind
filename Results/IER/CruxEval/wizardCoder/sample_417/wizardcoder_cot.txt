Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    lst.reverse()
    lst.pop()
    lst.reverse()
    return lst
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([7, 8, 2, 8])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input.
The first line of the function reverses the list lst.
The second line of the function removes the last element of the list lst.
The third line of the function reverses the list lst again.
Finally, the function returns the modified list lst.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 8, 2, 8], we need to reverse the list [8, 2, 8, 7], remove the last element 7, and then reverse the list again to get [8, 2, 8].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 8, 2, 8] is [8, 2, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[8, 2, 8]
