Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    count = len(nums)
    for i in [i % 2 for i in range(count)]:
        nums.append(nums[i])
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-1, 0, 0, 1, 1])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The first line initializes a variable count to the length of the nums list.
The second line creates a new list using a list comprehension that iterates over the range of count and takes the remainder of each number divided by 2.
The third line iterates over the new list created in the previous step and appends the element at the current index to the nums list.
Finally, the function returns the modified nums list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1], we need to append the elements at indices 0 and 2 to the nums list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] is [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
