Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, length, index):
    ls = text.rsplit(None, index)
    return '_'.join([l[:length] for l in ls])
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('hypernimovichyp', 2, 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, length, and index.
The text parameter is a string that represents the input text.
The length parameter is an integer that represents the maximum length of each word in the output.
The index parameter is an integer that represents the index of the word to split the text.

The function first splits the text into a list of words using the rsplit() method. The rsplit() method splits the text at the specified index, starting from the right side of the string. In this case, the index is 2, which means to split the text at the second to last word.

Next, the function creates a new list by iterating over the list of words and selecting the first length characters of each word.

Finally, the function joins the list of words using the join() method and returns the resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hypernimovichyp", 2, and 2, we need to split the text at the second to last word, select the first two characters of each word, and join the resulting list of words with underscores.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hypernimovichyp", 2, and 2 is "hyper_nimovichyp".
<<<Output>>>
'hyper_nimovichyp'
