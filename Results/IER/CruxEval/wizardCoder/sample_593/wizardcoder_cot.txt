Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, n):
    pos = len(nums) - 1
    for i in range(-len(nums), 0):
        nums.insert(pos, nums[i])
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([], 14)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a list of integers nums and an integer n.
The function initializes a variable pos to the index of the last element in the list nums.
The function then iterates over the range from -len(nums) to 0 (inclusive) using a for loop.
Inside the loop, the function inserts the element at index i into the list nums at position pos.
Finally, the function returns the modified list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([], 14), we need to insert 14 elements into an empty list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ([], 14) is an empty list.
<<<Output>>>
[]
