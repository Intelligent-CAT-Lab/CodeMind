Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    values = {0: 3, 1: 4.5, 2: '-'}
    res = {}
    for i, j in values.items():
        if i % n!= 2:
            res[j] = n // 2
    return sorted(res)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(12)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer n as input and returns a sorted list of values from the dictionary values.
The dictionary values has three keys and their corresponding values are 3, 4.5, and '-'.
The for loop iterates over the items in the dictionary values and checks if the key is not divisible by n.
If the key is not divisible by n, the value is added to the dictionary res with the key as the value.
Finally, the sorted list of values from the dictionary res is returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 12, we need to iterate over the items in the dictionary values and check if the key is not divisible by 12.
The key 0 is not divisible by 12, so the value 3 is added to the dictionary res with the key as the value.
The key 1 is not divisible by 12, so the value 4.5 is added to the dictionary res with the key as the value.
The key 2 is divisible by 12, so it is not added to the dictionary res.
Finally, the sorted list of values from the dictionary res is [3, 4.5].

<<<Output>>>
[3, 4.5]
