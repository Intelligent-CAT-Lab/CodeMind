Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    d = dict(array)
    for key, value in d.items():
        if value < 0 or value > 9:
            return None
    return d
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(((8, 5), (8, 2), (5, 3)))`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array of tuples as input and returns a dictionary.
The dictionary is created by converting the array of tuples into a dictionary using the dict() function.
Next, the function iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary using the items() method.
For each key-value pair, the function checks if the value is less than 0 or greater than 9.
If the value is outside the range of 0 to 9, the function returns None.
If all the values are within the range of 0 to 9, the function returns the dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ((8, 5), (8, 2), (5, 3)), we need to create a dictionary from the input array.
The dictionary should have two keys (8 and 5) and their corresponding values should be 5 and 2, respectively.
Since the value 3 is outside the range of 0 to 9, the function should return None.

<<<Output>>>
None
