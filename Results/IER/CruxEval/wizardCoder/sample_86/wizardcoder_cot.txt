Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(instagram, imgur, wins):
    photos = [instagram, imgur]
    if instagram == imgur:
        return wins
    if wins == 1:
        return photos.pop()
    else:
        photos.reverse()
        return photos.pop()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e'], ['sdfs', 'dr2c', 'QWERTY'], 0)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: instagram, imgur, and wins.
instagram and imgur are lists of strings representing the photos uploaded by Instagram and Imgur, respectively.
wins is an integer representing the number of wins the user has.

The function first creates a list called photos by concatenating instagram and imgur.

Next, the function checks if instagram and imgur are equal. If they are, the function returns wins.

If wins is 1, the function returns the last element of photos (which is the photo uploaded by Instagram).

If wins is greater than 1, the function reverses the order of photos and returns the last element of the reversed list (which is the photo uploaded by Imgur).

<<<Output>>>The return value of the code is'sdfs'.
