Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(obj):
    for k, v in obj.items():
        if v >= 0:
            obj[k] = -v
    return obj
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'R': 0, 'T': 3, 'F': -6, 'K': 0})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary obj as input.
The for loop iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
For each key-value pair, if the value is greater than or equal to 0, the value is negated and assigned back to the same key in the dictionary.
Finally, the function returns the modified dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'R': 0, 'T': 3, 'F': -6, 'K': 0}, we need to negate the values of the keys 'T' and 'F'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'R': 0, 'T': 3, 'F': -6, 'K': 0} is {'R': 0, 'T': -3, 'F': 6, 'K': 0}.
<<<Output>>>
{'R': 0, 'T': -3, 'F': 6, 'K': 0}
