Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    if string.isalnum():
        return "ascii encoded is allowed for this language"
    return "more than ASCII"
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Str zahrnuje anglo-ameriæske vasi piscina and kuca!')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and checks if it contains only alphanumeric characters. If it does, it returns the string "ascii encoded is allowed for this language". Otherwise, it returns the string "more than ASCII".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Str zahrnuje anglo-ameriæske vasi piscina and kuca!", we need to check if it contains only alphanumeric characters.
The input string contains non-alphanumeric characters, so the output of executing the function f on the input is "more than ASCII".
<<<Output>>>
'more than ASCII'
