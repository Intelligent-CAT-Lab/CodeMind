Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, start):
    return text.startswith(start)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("Hello world", "Hello")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and start.
The function checks if the text starts with the start string.
If the text starts with the start string, the function returns True.
If the text does not start with the start string, the function returns False.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Hello world" and "Hello", we need to check if "Hello world" starts with "Hello".
The text "Hello world" starts with "Hello", so the function returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
