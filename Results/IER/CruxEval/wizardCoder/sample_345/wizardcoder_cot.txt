Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b):
    if a < b:
        return (b, a)
    return (a, b)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ml','mv')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments a and b.
If a is less than b, the function returns a tuple containing b and a.
Otherwise, the function returns a tuple containing a and b.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "ml" and "mv", we need to compare "ml" and "mv".
Since "ml" comes before "mv" in the alphabetical order, the function returns a tuple containing "mv" and "ml".
<<<Output>>>
('mv','ml')
