Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, i):
    nums.pop(i)
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47], 0)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums and an integer i as input.
The function removes the element at index i from the list nums using the pop() method.
The function returns the modified list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47], 0), we need to remove the first element of the list [35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47] which is 35.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47], 0) is [45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47].
<<<Output>>>
[45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]
