Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    array.reverse()
    try:
        found = array.index(elem)
    finally:
        array.reverse()
    return found
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, -3, 3, 2], 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, an array and an element.
The function reverses the array using the reverse() method.
The function tries to find the index of the element in the array using the index() method.
If the element is found, the function sets the found variable to the index of the element.
If an exception occurs during the execution of the try block, the finally block is executed.
The finally block reverses the array again to restore the original order of the elements.
The function returns the found variable.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, -3, 3, 2], 2), we need to reverse the array to [-3, 3, 5] and then find the index of 2 in the reversed array. Since 2 is not present in the original array, the function returns -1.

<<<Output>>>
-1
