Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, to_remove):
    new_text = list(text)
    if to_remove in new_text:
        index = new_text.index(to_remove)
        new_text.remove(to_remove)
        new_text.insert(index, '?')
        new_text.remove('?')
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('sjbrlfqmw', 'l')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and to_remove.
The first line creates a new list called new_text by converting the input text into a list of characters.
The second line checks if the to_remove character is present in the new_text list.
If it is present, the third line finds the index of the to_remove character in the new_text list.
The fourth line removes the to_remove character from the new_text list.
The fifth line inserts a '?' character at the index of the to_remove character in the new_text list.
The sixth line removes the '?' character from the new_text list.
Finally, the seventh line joins the characters in the new_text list into a single string and returns it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "sjbrlfqmw" and "l", we need to remove the 'l' character from the input string and replace it with a '?'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "sjbrlfqmw" and "l" is "sjb?rlfqmw".
<<<Output>>>
'sjb?rlfqmw'
