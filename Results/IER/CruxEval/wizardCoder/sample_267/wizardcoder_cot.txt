Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, space):
    if space < 0:
        return text
    return text.ljust(len(text) // 2 + space)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('sowpf', -7)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and space.
The space parameter is used to determine the number of spaces to add to the text.
If the space parameter is negative, the function returns the original text.
Otherwise, the function uses the ljust() method to add spaces to the text.
The ljust() method takes two parameters, the length of the resulting string and the character to use for padding.
In this case, the length of the resulting string is calculated as len(text) // 2 + space.
Since space is negative, the length of the resulting string is calculated as len(text) // 2 + space, which is equivalent to len(text) // 2.
The ljust() method then pads the text with spaces on the right side until the resulting string has the desired length.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "sowpf" and space -7 is "sowp  ".
<<<Output>>>
'sowp  '
