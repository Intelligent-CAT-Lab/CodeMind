Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    result_list = ['3', '3', '3', '3']
    if result_list:
        result_list.clear()
    return len(text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("mrq7y")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and initializes a list result_list with 4 elements.
The if statement checks if the list is empty or not. If it is not empty, it clears the list.
Finally, the function returns the length of the input string text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "mrq7y", we need to initialize the list with 4 elements, clear it, and return the length of the string "mrq7y".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "mrq7y" is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
