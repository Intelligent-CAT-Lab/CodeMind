Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    ind = array.index(elem)
    return ind * 2 + array[-ind - 1] * 3
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array and an element elem as input.
The function first finds the index of the element elem in the array using the index() method.
The function then multiplies the index by 2 and adds the product of the last element of the array (array[-1]) and 3.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2), we need to find the index of 2 in the array [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2] which is 1.
Therefore, the index of 2 in the array is 1.
The function then multiplies 1 by 2 and adds the product of the last element of the array (array[-1]) and 3.
The last element of the array is -8, so the product is -24.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2) is 1 * 2 + (-8) * 3 = 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
