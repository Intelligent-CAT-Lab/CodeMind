Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, letter):
    if letter in text:
        start = text.index(letter)
        return text[start + 1:] + text[:start + 1]
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('19kefp7', '9')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and letter.
The if statement checks if the letter is present in the text.
If the letter is present, the function returns the substring of text starting from the index of the letter plus one, concatenated with the substring of text ending at the index of the letter plus one.
If the letter is not present, the function returns the original text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "19kefp7" and the letter "9", we need to check if the letter "9" is present in the text "19kefp7".
The letter "9" is present in the text at index 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "19kefp7" and the letter "9" is "19kefp7".
<<<Output>>>
'19kefp7'
