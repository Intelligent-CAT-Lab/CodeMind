Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    nums = [y for y in nums if y > 0]
    if len(nums) <= 3:
        return nums
    nums.reverse()
    half = len(nums)//2
    return nums[:half] + [0]*5 + nums[half:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([10, 3, 2, 2, 6, 0])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers nums as input.
The first line of the function creates a new list nums_pos containing only the positive integers from nums.
The second line checks if the length of nums_pos is less than or equal to 3. If it is, the function returns nums_pos.
If the length of nums_pos is greater than 3, the function reverses the list nums_pos.
The third line calculates the length of nums_pos and divides it by 2 to get the index of the middle element.
The fourth line returns a new list that consists of the first half of nums_pos, followed by 5 zeros, followed by the second half of nums_pos.
<<<Output>>>The return value of the code for the input [10, 3, 2, 2, 6, 0] is [10, 6, 2, 2, 0, 0].
