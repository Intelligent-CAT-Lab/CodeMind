Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    text_list = [char for char in text]
    for i, char in enumerate(text_list):
        text_list[i] = char.swapcase()
    return ''.join(text_list)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('akA?riu')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the string with all the uppercase characters converted to lowercase and vice versa.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "akA?riu", we need to convert all the uppercase characters to lowercase and vice versa.
The first step is to convert the string to a list of characters using a list comprehension.
Next, we iterate over the list of characters using the enumerate function to get both the index and the character.
For each character, we use the swapcase method to convert it to lowercase or uppercase depending on its current case.
Finally, we join the list of characters back into a string using the join method.
The output of executing the function f on the input "akA?riu" is "aKa?RIU".
<<<Output>>>
'aKa?RIU'
