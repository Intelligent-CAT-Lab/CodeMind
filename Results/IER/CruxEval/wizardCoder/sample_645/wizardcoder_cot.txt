Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, target):
    if nums.count(0):
        return 0
    elif nums.count(target) < 3:
        return 1
    else:
        return nums.index(target)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 1, 1, 2], 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, nums and target.
The first if statement checks if the list nums contains the integer 0. If it does, the function returns 0.
The second elif statement checks if the list nums contains the integer target at least three times. If it does, the function returns 1.
The third else statement returns the index of the first occurrence of the integer target in the list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1, 2], 3), we need to check if the list [1, 1, 1, 2] contains the integer 0. Since it does not, we move to the next condition.
The list [1, 1, 1, 2] contains the integer 3 at least three times, so the function returns 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
