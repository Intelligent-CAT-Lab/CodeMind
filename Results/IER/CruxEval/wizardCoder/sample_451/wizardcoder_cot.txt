Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    text = list(text)
    for count, item in enumerate(text):
        if item == char:
            text.remove(item)
            return ''.join(text)
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('pn', 'p')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters, text and char.
The first line of the function converts the input text into a list of characters.
The second line loops through each character in the list using the enumerate function.
The third line checks if the current character is equal to the input character char.
If it is, the current character is removed from the list using the remove method.
The fourth line returns the modified list as a string using the join method.
If the input character is not found in the list, the original list is returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "pn" and 'p', we need to remove the 'p' character from the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "pn" and 'p' is "n".
<<<Output>>>
'n'
