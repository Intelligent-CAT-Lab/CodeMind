Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    new_text = ''
    for ch in text.lower().strip():
        if ch.isnumeric() or ch in 'ÄäÏïÖöÜü':
            new_text += ch
    return new_text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string new_text.
The new_text is initialized as an empty string.
The function then iterates over each character ch in the lowercase and stripped version of the input string text.
If the character ch is a numeric character or a special character, it is added to the new_text string.
If the character ch is not a numeric character or a special character, it is skipped.
Finally, the function returns the new_text string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "", we need to iterate over each character in the input string and add it to the new_text string if it is a numeric character or a special character.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "" is an empty string.
<<<Output>>>
