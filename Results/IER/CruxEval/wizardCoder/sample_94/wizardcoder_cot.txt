Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b):
    return {**a, **b}
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'w': 5, 'wi': 10}, {'w': 3})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two dictionaries a and b as input and returns a new dictionary that combines the key-value pairs of a and b.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'w': 5, 'wi': 10} and {'w': 3}, we need to combine the two dictionaries.
The key 'w' appears in both dictionaries, so the value associated with 'w' in the output dictionary should be the sum of the values associated with 'w' in the input dictionaries.
The key 'wi' only appears in the first dictionary, so the value associated with 'wi' in the output dictionary should be the value associated with 'wi' in the first input dictionary.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'w': 5, 'wi': 10} and {'w': 3} is {'w': 8, 'wi': 10}.
<<<Output>>>
{'w': 8, 'wi': 10}
