Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(stg, tabs):
    for tab in tabs:
        stg = stg.rstrip(tab)
    return stg
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('31849 let it!31849 pass!', ('3','1','8',' ','1','9','2','d'))`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string stg and a tuple of strings tabs.
The function iterates over the elements of the tuple tabs and removes them from the end of the string stg using the rstrip() method.
Finally, the function returns the modified string stg.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "31849 let it!31849 pass!" and the tuple ('3','1','8',' ','1','9','2','d'), we need to remove the tabs from the end of the string "31849 let it!31849 pass!".

The first tab to remove is '3', so we remove it from the end of the string using the rstrip() method. The resulting string is "31849 let it!31849 pas".

The second tab to remove is '1', so we remove it from the end of the string using the rstrip() method. The resulting string is "31849 let it!31849 pa".

The third tab to remove is '8', so we remove it from the end of the string using the rstrip() method. The resulting string is "31849 let it!31849 p".

The fourth tab to remove is'', so we remove it from the end of the string using the rstrip() method. The resulting string is "31849 let it!31849".

The fifth tab to remove is '1', so we remove it from the end of the string using the rstrip() method. The resulting string is "31849 let it!3184".

The sixth tab to remove is '9', so we remove it from the end of the string using the rstrip() method. The resulting string is "31849 let it!3184".

The seventh tab to remove is '2', so we remove it from the end of the string using the rstrip() method. The resulting string is "31849 let it!3184".

The eighth tab to remove is 'd', so we remove it from the end of the string using the rstrip() method. The
