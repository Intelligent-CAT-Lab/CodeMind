Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    while -1 in array:
        array.pop(-3)
    while 0 in array:
        array.pop()
    while 1 in array:
        array.pop(0)
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([0, 2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and performs the following operations on it:
- While -1 is present in the array, remove the element at index -3.
- While 0 is present in the array, remove the last element.
- While 1 is present in the array, remove the first element.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 2], we need to perform the following operations:
- While -1 is present in the array [0, 2], remove the element at index -3. Since -1 is not present in the array, this operation is not performed.
- While 0 is present in the array [0, 2], remove the last element. Since 0 is present in the array, the last element is removed, resulting in the output [0].
- While 1 is present in the array [0], remove the first element. Since 1 is not present in the array, this operation is not performed.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 2] is [0].
<<<Output>>>
[0]
