Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, repl):
    trans = str.maketrans(text.lower(), repl.lower())
    return text.translate(trans)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('upper case', 'lower case')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, text and repl.
The function creates a translation table using the maketrans() method of the str class.
The translation table is created by mapping each character in the text string to its corresponding character in the repl string.
The translate() method of the text string is then used to apply the translation table to the text string and return the modified string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "upper case", "lower case", we need to create a translation table that maps each uppercase character to its corresponding lowercase character.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "upper case", "lower case" is "lower case".
<<<Output>>>
'lower case'
