Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, n, c):
    width = len(c)*n
    for _ in range(width - len(s)):
        s = c + s
    return s
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('.', 0, '99')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: s (string), n (integer), and c (string).
The variable width is calculated as the product of the length of c and n.
The for loop iterates n times, adding c to the beginning of s for each iteration.
Finally, the function returns the modified string s.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ".", 0, and "99", we need to modify the string "." to have a length of 0, and then add "99" to the beginning of the modified string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ".", 0, and "99" is "99".
<<<Output>>>
'99'
