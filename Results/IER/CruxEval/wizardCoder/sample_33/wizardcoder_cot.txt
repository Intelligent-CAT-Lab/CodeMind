Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lists):
    dic = {}
    for n in lists:
        if n in dic:
            dic[n].append(lists.pop(lists.index(n)))
        else:
            dic[n] = lists[:lists.index(n) + 1]
    return str(dic).replace(' ', '')
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, 2, 7, 2, 3, 5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns a string representation of a dictionary.
The dictionary contains the keys as the unique elements of the input list and the values as the sublists of the input list that contain the corresponding key.
For example, if the input list is [5, 2, 7, 2, 3, 5], the dictionary would be {5: [5], 2: [2, 2], 7: [7], 3: [3], 5: [5]}.
The function first initializes an empty dictionary dic.
Then it iterates over each element n in the input list.
If n is already a key in the dictionary dic, it appends the sublist of the input list that contains n to the value list of the corresponding key.
Otherwise, it creates a new key-value pair in the dictionary dic with the key n and the value list containing the first n elements of the input list.
Finally, the function returns a string representation of the dictionary dic, with all spaces removed.
<<<Output>>>
'{2: [2, 2], 3: [3], 5: [5, 5], 7: [7]}'
