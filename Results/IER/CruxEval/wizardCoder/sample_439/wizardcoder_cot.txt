Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(value):
    parts = value.partition(' ')[::2]
    return ''.join(parts)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('coscifysu')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string value as input and splits it into three parts using the partition() method. The partition() method splits a string into three parts around a specified separator. In this case, the separator is a space character. The [::2] slice notation is used to select every second element from the resulting list of parts. Finally, the join() method is used to concatenate the selected parts into a single string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "coscifysu", we need to split the input into three parts: "cos", "ci", and "fy". We then select every second element from this list, which gives us "ci". Finally, we concatenate the selected parts into a single string, which gives us "ci".
<<<Output>>>
'ci'
