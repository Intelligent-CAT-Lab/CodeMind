Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    c = array
    array_copy = array

    while True:
        c.append('_')
        if c == array_copy:
            array_copy[c.index('_')] = ''
            break
        
    return array_copy
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a modified copy of the array.
The modified copy is obtained by appending an underscore to the end of the input array, and then replacing the first occurrence of an underscore with an empty string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [], we need to append an underscore to the end of the input array, and then replace the first occurrence of an underscore with an empty string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [] is ['_'].
<<<Output>>>
['_']
