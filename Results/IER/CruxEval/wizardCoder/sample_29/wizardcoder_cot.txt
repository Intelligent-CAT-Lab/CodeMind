Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    nums = list(filter(str.isnumeric, text))
    assert len(nums) > 0
    return ''.join(nums)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('-123   \t+314')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input.
The first line of the function uses the filter() function to create a list of all the numeric characters in the input string.
The filter() function takes two arguments: a function and an iterable. The function is applied to each element of the iterable and only those elements for which the function returns True are included in the output list. In this case, the function is str.isnumeric, which returns True if the character is a numeric digit.
The second line of the function uses the assert keyword to check that the list of numeric characters is not empty. If the list is empty, an AssertionError is raised.
The third line of the function uses the join() method to concatenate all the numeric characters in the list into a single string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "-123   \t+314", we need to first filter out all the non-numeric characters and then concatenate the remaining numeric characters into a single string.
The filtered list of numeric characters is ['1', '2', '3', '3', '1', '4'].
The output of executing the function f on the input "-123   \t+314" is "123314".
<<<Output>>>
'123314'
