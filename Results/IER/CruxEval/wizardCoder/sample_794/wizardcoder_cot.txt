Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(line):
    a = []
    for c in line:
        if c.isalnum():
            a.append(c)
    return ''.join(a)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string line as input and returns a string that contains only the alphanumeric characters of the input string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'", we need to iterate over each character of the input string and append it to a new list if it is alphanumeric.
After iterating over all the characters, we join the list of alphanumeric characters to form a new string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'" is "normalcharsqwet42".
<<<Output>>>
'normalcharsqwet42'
