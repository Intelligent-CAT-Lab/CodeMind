Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b):
    d = dict(zip(a, b))
    a.sort(key=d.get, reverse=True)
    return [d.pop(x) for x in a]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['12','ab'], [2,2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two lists a and b as input.
The first line creates a dictionary d by zipping the two lists a and b.
The second line sorts the list a in descending order based on the values of the dictionary d.
The third line creates a list of values from the dictionary d, in the order specified by the sorted list a.
The output of executing the function f on the input ['12','ab'], [2,2] is [2, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 2]
