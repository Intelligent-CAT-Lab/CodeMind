Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(phrase):
    ans = 0
    for w in phrase.split():
        for ch in w:
            if ch == "0":
                ans += 1
    return ans
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("aboba 212 has 0 digits")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string phrase as input and returns the number of zeros in the phrase.
To determine the number of zeros in the phrase, we need to iterate over each word in the phrase and each character in the word.
If we find a character "0", we increment the answer by 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "aboba 212 has 0 digits" is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
