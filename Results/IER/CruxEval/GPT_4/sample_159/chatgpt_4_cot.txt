<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string st as input and initializes an empty string swapped. It then iterates over the reversed string st, swapping the case of each character and appending it to the swapped string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'RTiGM', we need to reverse the string and swap the case of each character:
- The reversed string of 'RTiGM' is 'MGiTR'.
- Swapping the case of each character results in 'mgItr'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'RTiGM' is 'mgItr'.
<<<Output>>>
'mgItr'
