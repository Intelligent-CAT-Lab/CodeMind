<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of strings `txt` and a string `alpha`. It performs the following steps:
1. Sorts the list `txt` in ascending order.
2. Finds the index of the string `alpha` in the sorted list.
3. Checks if the index of `alpha` is even (using modulo 2).
4. If the index is even, it returns the sorted list in reverse order.
5. If the index is not even, it returns the sorted list as is.

For the input `(['8', '9', '7', '4', '3', '2'], '9')`, the steps are as follows:
1. The list `['8', '9', '7', '4', '3', '2']` is sorted to `['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9']`.
2. The index of `'9'` in the sorted list is 5.
3. Since 5 % 2 is 1 (which is not even), the condition is false.
4. The function will return the sorted list without reversing it.

Therefore, the output will be the sorted list `['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9']`.

['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9']
