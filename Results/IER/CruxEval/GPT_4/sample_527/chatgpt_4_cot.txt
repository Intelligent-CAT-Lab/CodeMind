<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, text and value. It returns a new string that is a version of the text left-justified in a string of a length equal to the length of value, padded with the character "?".

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs "!?" and "", we need to consider the following:
- The len function is used to determine the length of the value argument, which in this case is an empty string. Therefore, len(value) is 0.
- The ljust method is used to left-justify the text in a string of length equal to len(value), which is 0. Since the length of the string to justify in is 0, the ljust method will not add any padding characters to the text.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs "!?" and "" is the original text "!?" without any changes, because the length of the value is 0 and no padding is needed.
