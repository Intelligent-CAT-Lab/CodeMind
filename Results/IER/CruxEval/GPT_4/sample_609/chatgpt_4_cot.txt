<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: array and elem. The array is expected to be a dictionary, and elem is the element to be checked against the keys and values of the dictionary.

1. The function starts by creating a copy of the input dictionary to avoid modifying the original dictionary. Since the input dictionary is empty, the result will also be an empty dictionary.

2. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as the result dictionary is not empty. However, since the result dictionary is already empty, the while loop will not execute.

3. Since the while loop does not execute, the function will return the result dictionary as it is, which is an empty dictionary.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ({}, 1) is an empty dictionary.
