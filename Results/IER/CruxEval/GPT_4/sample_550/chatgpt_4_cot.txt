<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input and performs the following operations:
1. It iterates over the list using a for loop with a range based on the length of the list.
2. During each iteration, it inserts the square of the current element at the current index.

Let's analyze the steps for the input [1, 2, 4]:
- Initially, nums = [1, 2, 4]
- i = 0: Insert the square of nums[0] at index 0.
  nums becomes [1, 1, 2, 4]
- i = 1: Insert the square of nums[1] (which is now 1) at index 1.
  nums becomes [1, 1, 1, 2, 4]
- i = 2: Insert the square of nums[2] (which is now 1) at index 2.
  nums becomes [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4]
- i = 3: Insert the square of nums[3] (which is now 2) at index 3.
  nums becomes [1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4]
- i = 4: Insert the square of nums[4] (which is now 1) at index 4.
  nums becomes [1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 4]
- i = 5: Insert the square of nums[5] (which is now 2) at index 5.
  nums becomes [1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4]
- i = 6: Insert the square of nums[6] (which is now 1) at index 6.
  nums becomes [1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 4]

The loop stops here because the original length of the list was 3, and the range in the for loop was from 0 to 2 (inclusive).

Therefore, the final list after the loop is [1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 4], and this is what the function returns.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 4]
