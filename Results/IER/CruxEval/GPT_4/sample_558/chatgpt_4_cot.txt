<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two lists as input: `nums` and `mos`. It performs the following steps:

1. It iterates over each element in `mos` and removes the first occurrence of that element from `nums` using `pop` and `index`.
2. It sorts the remaining elements in `nums`.
3. It appends each element of `mos` to the end of `nums`.
4. It iterates over `nums` and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If any element is greater than the next one, it returns `False`.
5. If the loop completes without finding any element out of order, it returns `True`.

Let's apply these steps to the input `([3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1], [1])`:

1. Remove all occurrences of `1` from `nums`: The resulting list is `[3, 2, 4]`.
2. Sort the list: The sorted list is `[2, 3, 4]`.
3. Append the elements of `mos` (`[1]`) to the end of `nums`: The resulting list is `[2, 3, 4, 1]`.
4. Check if the list is sorted: The list `[2, 3, 4, 1]` is not sorted because `4` is greater than `1`.
5. Since the list is not sorted, the function should return `False`.
