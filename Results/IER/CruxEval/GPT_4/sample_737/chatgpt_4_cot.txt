<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input and initializes a variable `counts` to 0. It then iterates over each number in the list `nums` and performs the following checks:
1. It converts the number to a string and checks if it is a decimal using the `isdecimal()` method. This method returns True if all characters in the string are decimals.
2. If the number is a decimal and `counts` is 0, it increments `counts` by 1.

The function only increments `counts` the first time it encounters a decimal number when `counts` is 0. After the first increment, `counts` will no longer be 0, so no further increments will occur.

Now, let's analyze the input `[0, 6, 2, -1, -2]`:
- `0` is a decimal, so `counts` becomes 1.
- `6` is a decimal, but `counts` is no longer 0, so it remains 1.
- `2` is a decimal, but `counts` is still not 0, so it remains 1.
- `-1` is not a decimal because of the negative sign, so `counts` remains 1.
- `-2` is also not a decimal because of the negative sign, so `counts` remains 1.

The function will return the value of `counts`, which is 1.
