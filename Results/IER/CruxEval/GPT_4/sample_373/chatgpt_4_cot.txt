<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list orig as input and performs the following operations:
1. It assigns the list orig to a new variable copy. Since lists are mutable in Python, both orig and copy refer to the same list object in memory.
2. It appends the integer 100 to the list referred to by copy. Since orig and copy are references to the same list, the list now contains [1, 2, 3, 100].
3. It removes the last element from the list referred to by orig using the pop method. Since orig and copy are still references to the same list, the list now contains [1, 2, 100].
4. It returns the list referred to by copy, which is the same as the list referred to by orig after the modifications.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 100].

[1, 2, 100]
