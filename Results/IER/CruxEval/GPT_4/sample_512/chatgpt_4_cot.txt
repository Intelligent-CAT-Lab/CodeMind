<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns True if the length of s is equal to the sum of the number of occurrences of '0' and '1' in s, otherwise it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "102", we need to perform the following steps:
1. Calculate the length of the string "102", which is 3.
2. Count the number of occurrences of '0' in "102", which is 1.
3. Count the number of occurrences of '1' in "102", which is 1.
4. Add the counts of '0' and '1', which gives us 1 + 1 = 2.
5. Compare the length of the string (3) with the sum of the counts of '0' and '1' (2).

Since the length of the string (3) is not equal to the sum of the counts of '0' and '1' (2), the function will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
