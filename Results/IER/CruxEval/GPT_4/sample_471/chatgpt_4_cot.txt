<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a character 'val' and a string 'text'. It then creates a list called 'indices' which contains the indices of all occurrences of 'val' in 'text'.

The function iterates over the range of indices in 'text' (from 0 to the length of 'text' minus one) and checks if the character at each index is equal to 'val'. If it is, the index is added to the 'indices' list.

For the input 'o' and 'fnmart', the function will check each character in 'fnmart' to see if it is 'o'. Since 'o' does not appear in 'fnmart', the 'indices' list will remain empty.

After the loop, the function checks if the 'indices' list is empty. If it is, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it would return the first element of the 'indices' list, which would be the index of the first occurrence of 'val' in 'text'.

Since 'o' does not appear in 'fnmart', the 'indices' list is empty, and the function will return -1.
<<<Output>>>
