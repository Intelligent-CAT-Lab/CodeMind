<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a string `text`, another string `suffix`, and an integer `num`.
The function converts the integer `num` to a string and stores it in the variable `str_num`.
It then checks if the `text` ends with the concatenation of `suffix` and `str_num` using the `endswith` method.
For the input `f('friends and love', 'and', 3)`, the `suffix` is 'and' and `num` is 3, which is converted to the string '3'.
The function checks if 'friends and love' ends with 'and3'.
Since 'friends and love' does not end with 'and3', the function will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
