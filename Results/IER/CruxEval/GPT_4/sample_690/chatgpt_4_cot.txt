<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an input n, which is expected to be a number. However, in this case, the input is provided as a string '800'.

First, the function checks if the string representation of n contains a decimal point by using the find method. If a decimal point is found, it would return a non-negative index, otherwise, it returns -1.

Since '800' does not contain a decimal point, the find method will return -1.

Because the condition str(n).find('.') != -1 is not met, the function will not execute the code inside the if block.

Instead, it will proceed to the next line, which is simply return str(n).

Therefore, the function will return the string '800' without any changes.
<<<Output>>>
'800'
