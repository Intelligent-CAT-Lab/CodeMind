<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two arguments: a list of numbers `nums` and a function `verdict`. It performs the following steps:

1. It creates a new list `res` that contains all elements from `nums` that are not equal to 0.
2. It then creates a list of lists `result`, where each inner list contains an element from `res` and the result of applying the `verdict` function to that element.
3. If `result` is not empty, it returns `result`. Otherwise, it returns the string 'error - no numbers or all zeros!'.

Let's apply these steps to the input `[0, 3, 0, 1]` and the lambda function `lambda x: x < 2`:

1. The list `res` will be `[3, 1]` because 0s are filtered out.
2. The list `result` will be `[[3, False], [1, True]]` because for each number in `res`, we create a list with the number and the result of `verdict(x)`. For 3, `verdict(3)` is `3 < 2`, which is `False`. For 1, `verdict(1)` is `1 < 2`, which is `True`.
3. Since `result` is not empty, the function will return `[[3, False], [1, True]]`.

[[3, False], [1, True]]
