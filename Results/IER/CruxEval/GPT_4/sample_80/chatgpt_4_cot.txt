<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and performs two operations on it:
1. It removes any trailing whitespace from the string using the rstrip() method.
2. It reverses the string using the reversed() function and then joins the characters back into a string using the join() method.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ab        ', we need to follow these steps:
- First, the rstrip() method will remove all the trailing spaces from the input string 'ab        ', resulting in 'ab'.
- Next, the reversed() function will reverse 'ab' to 'ba'.
- Finally, the join() method will join the characters of the reversed string into a single string 'ba'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ab        ' is 'ba'.
<<<Output>>>
'ba'
