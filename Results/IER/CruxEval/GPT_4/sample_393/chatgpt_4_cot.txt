The function f takes a string `text` as input and performs the following operations:

1. It reverses the string `text` and stores it in the variable `ls`.
2. It initializes an empty string `text2`.
3. It then iterates over the reversed string `ls` in steps of 3 characters from the end of the string towards the beginning, but it skips the last 3 characters because the range is defined from `len(ls) - 3` to `0`.
4. In each iteration, it takes a slice of 3 characters from `ls` and joins them with '---', then appends this to `text2` followed by another '---'.
5. After the loop, it removes the last 3 characters from `text2` (which are '---') and returns the result.

Let's apply this logic to the input 'scala':

1. The reversed string `ls` is 'alacs'.
2. The length of `ls` is 5.
3. The loop will start at index `5 - 3 = 2` and end before index `0`. This means it will only iterate once, taking the slice from index 2 to 5 (not including 5).
4. The slice `ls[2:5]` is 'acs'.
5. 'acs' is joined with '---' to form 'a---c---s' and '---' is appended to get 'a---c---s---'.
6. The last 3 characters '---' are removed, resulting in 'a---c---s'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'scala' is 'a---c---s'.
