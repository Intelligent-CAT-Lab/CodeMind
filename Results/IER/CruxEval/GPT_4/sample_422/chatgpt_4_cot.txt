<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list called array as input and performs the following steps:
1. It creates a copy of the input list to avoid modifying the original list. This is done using the array.copy() method.
2. It reverses the copied list using the reversed() function. Note that reversed() returns an iterator that accesses the given sequence in the reverse order.
3. It then uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the reversed list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 1], we need to follow these steps:
- Copy the list: new_array = [1, 2, 1]
- Reverse the list: new_array = [1, 2, 1] (reversed)
- Square each element: [1*1, 2*2, 1*1] which results in [1, 4, 1]

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 1] is [1, 4, 1].
