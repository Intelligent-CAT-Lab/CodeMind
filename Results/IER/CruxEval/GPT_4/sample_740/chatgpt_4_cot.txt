<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list called plot and a value called delin.
The function checks if delin is an element within the plot list.
If delin is found in the plot list, the function finds the index of delin in the plot list and assigns it to the variable split.
It then creates a new list called first, which contains all elements of plot before the index split.
It also creates a new list called second, which contains all elements of plot after the index split.
The function then returns the concatenation of first and second, effectively removing the element at index split from the original plot list.
If delin is not found in the plot list, the function simply returns the original plot list.

For the input `f([1, 2, 3, 4], 3)`, the value of delin (3) is present in the plot list.
The index of delin (3) in the plot list is 2.
Therefore, first will be [1, 2] and second will be [4].
The function will return the concatenation of first and second, which is [1, 2, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 4]
