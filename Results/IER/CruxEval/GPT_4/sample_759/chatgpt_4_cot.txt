<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a string `text` and a substring `sub`. It returns a list of indices where the substring `sub` is found within the string `text`.

The function initializes an empty list `index` and a variable `starting` with the value 0. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `starting` is not equal to -1.

Inside the loop, the `find` method is used to search for the substring `sub` in `text`, starting from the current `starting` position. If `find` returns -1, it means the substring is not found, and the loop will terminate.

If the substring is found, its starting index is appended to the `index` list. The `starting` variable is then incremented by the length of `sub` to continue searching for the next occurrence of the substring after the current one.

For the input `f('egmdartoa', 'good')`, the substring 'good' does not exist in the string 'egmdartoa'. Therefore, the `find` method will return -1 on the first iteration, and the while loop will terminate without appending any indices to the `index` list.

Hence, the function will return an empty list as there are no occurrences of 'good' in 'egmdartoa'.
