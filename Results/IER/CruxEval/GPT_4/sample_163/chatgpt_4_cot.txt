<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a string `text`, a string `space_symbol`, and an integer `size`.
The function aims to append a certain number of `space_symbol` to the `text` until the total length of the resulting string is equal to `size`.

Here are the steps the function will follow with the given input `f('w', '))', 7)`:

1. Calculate the number of times `space_symbol` needs to be repeated. This is done by subtracting the length of `text` from `size`, which is `7 - len('w') = 7 - 1 = 6`.
2. Generate a string of `space_symbol` repeated the calculated number of times. Since `space_symbol` is '))' and it needs to be repeated 6 times, the generated string will be '))))))' (which is '))' repeated 3 times to make a total length of 6 characters).
3. Concatenate the original `text` with the generated string of spaces. The result will be 'w' + '))))))' which is 'w))))))'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('w', '))', 7) will be 'w))))))'.
