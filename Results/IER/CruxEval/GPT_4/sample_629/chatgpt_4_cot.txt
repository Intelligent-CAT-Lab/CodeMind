<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two arguments: a string `text` and a substring `dng`. It checks if `dng` is not in `text`, and if so, it returns `text`. If `dng` is at the end of `text`, it removes `dng` from `text` and returns the result. If `dng` is not at the end, it removes the last character from `text` and recursively calls `f` with the new `text` minus the last two characters.

Let's analyze the call `f('catNG', 'NG')` step by step:

1. Check if 'NG' is not in 'catNG'. It is, so we don't return `text` here.
2. Check if the last two characters of 'catNG' are 'NG'. They are, so we return 'catNG'[:-len('NG')], which is 'catNG'[:-2], resulting in 'cat'.

Since the condition is met and the function returns before the recursive call, there is no need to go further.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the inputs 'catNG' and 'NG' is 'cat'.
