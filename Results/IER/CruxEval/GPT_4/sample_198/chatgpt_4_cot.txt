<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `text` and a string `strip_chars`. It performs the following operations:
1. It reverses the string `text` using slicing with `[::-1]`.
2. It then strips any characters found in `strip_chars` from both ends of the reversed string.
3. Finally, it reverses the string again to restore the original order of the remaining characters.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'tcmfsmj' with the strip characters 'cfj', we follow these steps:
1. Reverse 'tcmfsmj' to get 'jmsfmct'.
2. Strip 'cfj' from both ends of 'jmsfmct' to get 'msfm'.
3. Reverse 'msfm' to get 'mfsm'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'tcmfsmj' with the strip characters 'cfj' is 'mfsm'.
<<<Output>>>
'mfsm'
