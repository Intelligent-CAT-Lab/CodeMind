<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `text` and an integer `num`. It performs the following steps:

1. It calculates `req` by subtracting the length of `text` from `num`. In this case, `req` is `19 - 1 = 18`.
2. It then centers the `text` within a string of length `num` using `*` as the padding character. The centered string will have equal numbers of `*` on both sides of `text` if `req` is even, which it is in this case. The resulting string will be `*********a*********`.
3. Finally, it returns a slice of the centered string. The slice starts from `req // 2` from the end of the string and goes to the start of the string with a step of `-req // 2`. In this case, `req // 2` is `18 // 2 = 9`. The slice will start at index `-9` (which is the second `*` from the end of the string) and will step with `-9`, effectively returning only the character at index `-9`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('a', 19) will be the character at index `-9` of the string `*********a*********`, which is `*`.
