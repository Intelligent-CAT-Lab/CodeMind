<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a list lst, an integer i, and an integer n. It inserts the integer n at the index i of the list lst and then returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99], 4, 15), we need to insert the integer 15 at index 4 of the list [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99].

The original list is: [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99]
After inserting 15 at index 4, the list becomes: [44, 34, 23, 82, 15, 24, 11, 63, 99]

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input is the modified list with 15 inserted at the fourth index.
<<<Output>>>
[44, 34, 23, 82, 15, 24, 11, 63, 99]
