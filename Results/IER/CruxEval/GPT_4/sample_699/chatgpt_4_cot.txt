<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, text and elem. It checks if elem is not an empty string and then performs two while loops:
1. The first while loop checks if the text starts with elem. If it does, it replaces elem in text with an empty string. This loop will continue until text no longer starts with elem.
2. The second while loop checks if elem starts with text. If it does, it replaces text in elem with an empty string. This loop will continue until elem no longer starts with text.

For the input `f("some", "1")`:
- The first condition `elem != ''` is True since elem is "1".
- The first while loop checks if "some" starts with "1". It does not, so the loop does not execute.
- The second while loop checks if "1" starts with "some". It does not, so the loop does not execute.

Since neither of the while loops execute, the function returns the original values of elem and text in a list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs "some" and "1" is ["1", "some"].
