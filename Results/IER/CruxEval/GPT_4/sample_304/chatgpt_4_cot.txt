The function f takes a dictionary d as input and performs the following steps:

1. It sorts the items of the dictionary by keys in descending order and selects the first item's key, which is the largest key. This is stored in the variable key1.
2. It removes the key-value pair from the dictionary d where the key is key1. The value associated with key1 is stored in the variable val1.
3. It again sorts the remaining items of the dictionary by keys in descending order and selects the first item's key, which is now the second largest key since the largest has been removed. This is stored in the variable key2.
4. It removes the key-value pair from the dictionary d where the key is key2. The value associated with key2 is stored in the variable val2.
5. It returns a new dictionary with the two removed key-value pairs.

Let's apply these steps to the input `{2: 3, 17: 3, 16: 6, 18: 6, 87: 7}`:

1. The sorted keys in descending order are [87, 18, 17, 16, 2]. The largest key is 87.
2. The value associated with key 87 is removed from the dictionary, so val1 is 7.
3. The remaining dictionary is `{2: 3, 17: 3, 16: 6, 18: 6}`. The sorted keys in descending order are now [18, 17, 16, 2]. The second largest key is 18.
4. The value associated with key 18 is removed from the dictionary, so val2 is 6.
5. The function returns a new dictionary with the two removed key-value pairs: `{87: 7, 18: 6}`.

<<<Output>>>
{87: 7, 18: 6}
