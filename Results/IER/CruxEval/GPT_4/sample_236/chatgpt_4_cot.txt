<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings as input and processes it as follows:

1. It checks if the length of the input array is 1. If so, it joins the array into a string and returns it. This is not the case for our input `['ac8', 'qk6', '9wg']`, which has a length of 3.

2. It creates a copy of the input array called `result`.

3. It initializes a variable `i` to 0, which will be used as an index to iterate over the elements of the array.

4. It enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the array minus 1. In our case, the length of the array is 3, so the loop will continue while `i` is less than 2.

5. Inside the while loop, there is a for loop that iterates twice (range(2)). During each iteration of the for loop, the element at index `i` of the original array is assigned to the element at index `i*2` of the result array. Then, `i` is incremented by 1.

6. After the while loop, the function joins the `result` list into a string and returns it.

Let's walk through the code with the input `['ac8', 'qk6', '9wg']`:

- The while loop starts with `i = 0` and will run while `i < 2`.
- On the first iteration of the for loop, `result[0]` is set to `array[0]` which is 'ac8', and `i` becomes 1.
- On the second iteration of the for loop, `result[2]` is set to `array[1]` which is 'qk6', and `i` becomes 2.
- Now `i` is equal to 2, which is not less than 2, so the while loop ends.

The final `result` list is `['ac8', 'qk6', 'qk6', '9wg']`. When joined into a string, it becomes 'ac8qk6qk69wg'.
