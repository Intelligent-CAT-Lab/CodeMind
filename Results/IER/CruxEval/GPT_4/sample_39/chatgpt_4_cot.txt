<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an array (list) and an element (elem).
It checks if the element is present in the array using the 'in' keyword.
If the element is found in the array, the function returns the index of the element using the array.index(elem) method.
If the element is not found, the function returns -1.

For the given input, the function is called with the array [6, 2, 7, 1] and the element 6.
The element 6 is present in the array, and its index is 0 (since indexing in Python starts at 0).
Therefore, the function will return the index of the element 6, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
