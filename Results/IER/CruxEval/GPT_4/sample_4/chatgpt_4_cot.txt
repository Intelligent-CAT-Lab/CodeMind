<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings `array` as input and performs the following steps:
1. It initializes a string `s` with a single space character.
2. It concatenates all the strings in the input `array` using the `join` method and appends the result to `s`.
3. It returns the resulting string `s`.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `[' ', '  ', '    ', '   ']`, we need to concatenate the strings in the array with the initial string `s` which already contains a single space.

The input array contains four strings with varying numbers of spaces: one space, two spaces, four spaces, and three spaces, respectively. When these are concatenated together, we get a string with a total of 1 (initial space in `s`) + 1 (first element) + 2 (second element) + 4 (third element) + 3 (fourth element) = 11 spaces.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `[' ', '  ', '    ', '   ']` is a string with 11 spaces.
