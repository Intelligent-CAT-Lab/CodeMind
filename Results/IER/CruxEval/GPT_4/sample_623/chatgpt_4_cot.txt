<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `text` and a list of `rules`. It processes the text according to the rules in the following way:
- If the rule is '@', it reverses the text.
- If the rule is '~', it converts the text to uppercase.
- If the text ends with the rule character, it removes the last character from the text.

Let's apply the rules one by one to the input text 'hi~!':
1. The first rule is '~', so the text is converted to uppercase: 'HI~!'.
2. The second rule is '`', which does not match the last character of the text, so no changes are made.
3. The third rule is '!', which matches the last character of the text, so the last character is removed: 'HI~'.
4. The fourth rule is '&', which does not match the last character of the text, so no changes are made.

After applying all the rules, the final text is 'HI~'.
<<<Output>>>
'HI~'
