<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a list called values, and two items called item1 and item2.

1. The function first checks if the last element of the list values is equal to item2. In this case, values[-1] is 1, which is not equal to item2 (which is 3), so the first if condition is not satisfied.

2. The function then checks the elif condition to see if the last element of the list values is equal to item1. In this case, values[-1] is 1, which is not equal to item1 (which is 2), so the elif condition is also not satisfied.

3. Since neither the if nor the elif conditions are satisfied, the function does not modify the list and proceeds to return the original list values.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ([1, 1], 2, 3) is the original list [1, 1].
