<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of years as input and performs the following steps:
1. It calculates a10 as the sum of years that are less than or equal to 1900.
2. It calculates a90 as the sum of years that are greater than 1910.
3. It then checks if a10 is greater than 3; if so, it returns 3.
4. If a10 is not greater than 3, it checks if a90 is greater than 3; if so, it returns 1.
5. If neither a10 nor a90 is greater than 3, it returns 2.

For the input [1872, 1995, 1945]:
- a10 would be the sum of years less than or equal to 1900, which is just 1872 in this case, so a10 = 1.
- a90 would be the sum of years greater than 1910, which are 1995 and 1945, so a90 = 2.

Since neither a10 nor a90 is greater than 3, the function will return 2.
