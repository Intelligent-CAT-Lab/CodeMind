<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of fruits as input and performs the following operations:
1. It checks if the last element in the list is the same as the first element. If they are the same, it returns 'no'.
2. If the first and last elements are not the same, it removes the first and last elements from the list twice.

Let's apply these steps to the input list `['apple', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'pear', 'orange', 'orange']`:
- The first element is 'apple' and the last element is 'orange', so they are not the same.
- We remove the first element ('apple') and the last element ('orange') from the list.
- The modified list is now `['apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'pear', 'orange']`.
- We remove the first element ('apple') and the last element ('orange') from the list again.
- The modified list is now `['pear', 'banana', 'pear']`.

Therefore, the function will return the list `['pear', 'banana', 'pear']` after executing the given operations.
<<<Output>>>
['pear', 'banana', 'pear']
