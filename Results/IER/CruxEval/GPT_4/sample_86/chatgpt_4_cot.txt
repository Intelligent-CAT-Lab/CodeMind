<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: instagram, imgur, and wins. It then creates a list called photos containing the instagram and imgur lists.

The function first checks if instagram is equal to imgur. In this case, instagram is ['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e'] and imgur is ['sdfs', 'dr2c', 'QWERTY'], so they are not equal. Therefore, the function does not return wins and continues.

Next, the function checks if wins is equal to 1. In this case, wins is 0, so this condition is also false. Therefore, the function does not return photos.pop() and continues.

Since neither of the first two conditions is met, the function proceeds to the else block. Here, it reverses the photos list and then pops the last element from the list.

After reversing, the photos list will be:
[['sdfs', 'dr2c', 'QWERTY'], ['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e']]

Then, photos.pop() will remove and return the last element of the list, which is ['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e'].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given inputs will be ['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e'].
<<<Output>>>
['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e']
