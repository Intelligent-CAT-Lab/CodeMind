<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary `dic` as input and returns a sorted list of the dictionary's items (key-value pairs).
The sorting is done based on the keys of the dictionary, as indicated by the lambda function `key=lambda x: x[0]`, where `x[0]` represents the key of each item.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `{'b': 1, 'a': 2}`, we need to perform the following steps:
1. Convert the dictionary items into a list of tuples. The items of the input dictionary are `[('b', 1), ('a', 2)]`.
2. Sort this list of tuples based on the keys (the first element of each tuple). The sorted list will be `[('a', 2), ('b', 1)]` because 'a' comes before 'b' in lexicographical order.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `{'b': 1, 'a': 2}` is a sorted list of tuples based on the keys: `[('a', 2), ('b', 1)]`.
<<<Output>>>
[('a', 2), ('b', 1)]
