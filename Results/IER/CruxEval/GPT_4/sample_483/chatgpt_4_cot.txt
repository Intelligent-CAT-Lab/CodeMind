<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `text` and a character `char`. It returns a new string that is created by splitting the `text` string at each occurrence of `char` and then joining the resulting list of strings with a space character.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'a' and 'a', we need to follow these steps:
1. Split the string 'a' at each occurrence of the character 'a'. Since the string 'a' consists of only one character which is the same as `char`, the split operation will result in an empty string before and after the 'a', which gives us two empty strings.
2. The `len(text)` argument in the split function is not necessary in this case because there is only one occurrence of 'a' in 'a', and the split would behave the same way without it.
3. Join the resulting list of strings (which are two empty strings) with a space character. Joining two empty strings with a space will result in a single space character.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'a' and 'a' is a single space character.
