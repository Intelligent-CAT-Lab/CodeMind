<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: start, end, and interval. It generates a list of steps using the range function with these arguments. The range function will create a list starting from 'start' to 'end' (inclusive, since end + 1 is used) with a step size of 'interval'.

For the input f(3, 10, 1):
- The range function will generate a list from 3 to 11 (because end + 1 is 10 + 1) with an interval of 1.
- The generated list will be [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
- The function then checks if 1 is in the list, which it is not.
- Since 1 is not in the list, the last element of the list is not modified.
- The function returns the length of the list, which is the number of elements in it.

Therefore, the output will be the number of elements in the list [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], which is 9.
