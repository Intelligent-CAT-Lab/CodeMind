<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list arr as input and performs the following steps:
1. It initializes a variable count with the length of the input list arr.
2. It creates a copy of the input list arr and assigns it to the variable sub.
3. It then iterates over the indices of the list sub in steps of 2 (i.e., it processes every other element starting from index 0).
4. For each selected index i, it multiplies the element at that index by 5.
5. Finally, it returns the modified list sub.

For the input `[-3, -6, 2, 7]`, the function will perform the following operations:
- count is set to 4 (since there are 4 elements in the list).
- sub is a copy of arr, so sub is `[-3, -6, 2, 7]`.
- The loop will iterate over the indices 0 and 2.
- At index 0, sub[0] is -3, so it is multiplied by 5 to become -15.
- At index 2, sub[2] is 2, so it is multiplied by 5 to become 10.
- The elements at indices 1 and 3 remain unchanged because they are not processed by the loop.

After these operations, the list sub will be `[-15, -6, 10, 7]`.

[-15, -6, 10, 7]
