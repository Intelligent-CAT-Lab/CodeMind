<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of integers called places and a list of integers called lazy. The function performs the following steps:

1. It sorts the list places in ascending order.
2. It iterates over the list lazy and removes each element found in lazy from the list places.
3. It checks if the length of places is equal to 1 after the removals. If so, it returns 1.
4. It then iterates over the sorted and modified list places using enumerate, which provides both the index (i) and the value (place) of each item.
5. For each place in places, it checks if there is no consecutive integer (place+1) in the list places. If it finds a place without a consecutive integer, it returns the index of that place plus 1.
6. If all places have a consecutive integer, it returns the index of the last place plus 1.

Let's apply these steps to the input `([375, 564, 857, 90, 728, 92], [728])`:

1. After sorting, places becomes [90, 92, 375, 564, 728, 857].
2. The element 728 is removed from places, resulting in [90, 92, 375, 564, 857].
3. The length of places is not 1, so we skip the return 1 condition.
4. We iterate over the list [90, 92, 375, 564, 857]:
   - For place 90, there is a consecutive integer 91 (not in the list), but 92 is in the list, so we continue.
   - For place 92, there is no consecutive integer 93 in the list, so we return the index of 92 (which is 1) plus 1, which is 2.

Therefore, the function will return 2.
