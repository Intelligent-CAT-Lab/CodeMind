<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following steps:

1. It creates an empty dictionary d.
2. It iterates over each character in the string text after replacing all '-' characters with an empty string and converting the string to lowercase.
3. For each character, it checks if the character is already a key in the dictionary d.
   - If it is, it increments the value associated with that key by 1.
   - If it is not, it adds the character as a key to the dictionary with a value of 1.
4. After iterating through all characters, it sorts the dictionary items by their values (the number of occurrences of each character).
5. It creates a list comprehension that extracts only the values from the sorted dictionary items.

Now, let's apply these steps to the input "x--y-z-5-C":

- The input string with '-' removed and converted to lowercase is "xyz5c".
- The dictionary d after iterating over "xyz5c" would be: {'x': 1, 'y': 1, 'z': 1, '5': 1, 'c': 1}
- Sorting the dictionary items by their values would not change the order since all values are 1.
- The list comprehension would then extract the values from the dictionary items, resulting in a list of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "x--y-z-5-C" is a list of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
