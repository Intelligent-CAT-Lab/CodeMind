The function f takes a dictionary a as input. The first operation inside the function is to convert the dictionary items into a list, reverse the list, and then convert it back into a dictionary. This is done with the following code:
```
s = dict(list(a.items())[::-1])
```
The items() method returns a view object that displays a list of dictionary's (key, value) tuple pairs. The list() function is used to convert this view into a list. The [::-1] slice reverses the list. Finally, the dict() function converts the reversed list of tuples back into a dictionary.

For the input `{15: "Qltuf", 12: "Rwrepny"}`, the items() method would give us:
```
[(15, "Qltuf"), (12, "Rwrepny")]
```
Reversing this list gives us:
```
[(12, "Rwrepny"), (15, "Qltuf")]
```
Converting this back into a dictionary gives us:
```
{12: "Rwrepny", 15: "Qltuf"}
```
The next operation is to join the string representations of the dictionary's items with a space in between. This is done with the following code:
```
return " ".join([str(i) for i in s.items()])
```
The items() method is called again on the new dictionary s, and for each item, the str() function is used to convert the tuple into a string. The join() method then concatenates these strings with a space in between.

For the dictionary `{12: "Rwrepny", 15: "Qltuf"}`, the items() method would give us:
```
[(12, "Rwrepny"), (15, "Qltuf")]
```
Converting each tuple into a string gives us:
```
["(12, 'Rwrepny')", "(15, 'Qltuf')"]
```
Joining these strings with a space gives us the final output:
```
"(12, 'Rwrepny') (15, 'Qltuf')"
```
<<<Output>>>
"(12, 'Rwrepny') (15, 'Qltuf')"
