The function f takes a string text as input and processes it to count occurrences of certain characters after a transformation defined by a dictionary.

1. An empty dictionary `occ` is created to keep track of occurrences of characters after transformation.
2. The function iterates over each character `ch` in the input text "URW rNB".
3. For each character, a new dictionary `name` is created with mappings from 'a' to 'b', 'b' to 'c', 'c' to 'd', 'd' to 'e', and 'e' to 'f'.
4. The `name` dictionary is then used to get a transformed character for `ch` if `ch` is in the dictionary, otherwise `ch` itself is used.
5. The transformed character is then used to update the `occ` dictionary, incrementing the count for that character.
6. After processing all characters, a list comprehension is used to create a list of the values from the `occ` dictionary, which represents the counts of each character after transformation.

Let's process the input "URW rNB":
- 'U' is not in the name dictionary, so it remains 'U'. occ = {'U': 1}
- 'R' is not in the name dictionary, so it remains 'R'. occ = {'U': 1, 'R': 1}
- 'W' is not in the name dictionary, so it remains 'W'. occ = {'U': 1, 'R': 1, 'W': 1}
- ' ' (space) is not in the name dictionary, so it remains ' '. occ = {'U': 1, 'R': 1, 'W': 1, ' ': 1}
- 'r' is not in the name dictionary, so it remains 'r'. occ = {'U': 1, 'R': 1, 'W': 1, ' ': 1, 'r': 1}
- 'N' is not in the name dictionary, so it remains 'N'. occ = {'U': 1, 'R': 1, 'W': 1, ' ': 1, 'r': 1, 'N': 1}
- 'B' is in the name dictionary and maps to 'c'. occ = {'U': 1, 'R': 1, 'W': 1, ' ': 1, 'r': 1, 'N': 1, 'c': 1}

Finally, the function returns a list of the values from the `occ` dictionary, which are [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
