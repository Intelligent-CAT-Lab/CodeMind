The function f takes a list of integers as input and processes it to create a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list and the value is a list of integers.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of how the function processes the input `[5, 2, 7, 2, 3, 5]`:

1. The function initializes an empty dictionary `dic`.

2. It then iterates over each number `n` in the input list `lists`.

3. For the first number `5`, it is not in `dic`, so it adds `5` as a key with the value `[5]` (the sublist from the start of the list up to and including the first occurrence of `5`).

4. Next, it processes `2`. Since `2` is not in `dic`, it adds `2` as a key with the value `[5, 2]`.

5. The number `7` is processed next. It is not in `dic`, so it adds `7` as a key with the value `[5, 2, 7]`.

6. Now, it encounters `2` again. Since `2` is already a key in `dic`, it appends `2` to the value list of `2` in `dic`. However, it also removes the first occurrence of `2` from the input list using `pop`. The input list now becomes `[5, 7, 3, 5]`.

7. The number `3` is processed next. It is not in `dic`, so it adds `3` as a key with the value `[5, 7, 3]`.

8. Finally, it processes `5`. Since `5` is already a key in `dic`, it appends `5` to the value list of `5` in `dic`. It also removes the first occurrence of `5` from the input list using `pop`. The input list now becomes `[7, 3]`.

9. The function returns the dictionary `dic` as a string without spaces.

The final dictionary before converting to a string and removing spaces is:
{
    5: [5, 5],
    2: [5, 2, 2],
    7: [5, 2, 7],
    3: [5, 2, 7, 3]
}

After converting to a string and removing spaces, the output will be:
"{'5':[5,5],'2':[5,2,2],'7':[5,2,7],'3':[5,2,7,3]}"

<<<Output>>>
"{'5':[5,5],'2':[5,2,2],'7':[5,2,7],'3':[5,2,7,3]}"
