The function f takes a string `body` as input and performs the following steps:

1. Converts the string into a list of characters.
2. Initializes a variable `dist` to 0, which will be used to calculate the distance for tab expansion.
3. Iterates over the characters in the list, excluding the last character.
4. For each character at index `i`, it checks if the character two positions before (`i - 2`) is a tab character (`'\t'`). If `i - 2` is less than 0, it uses index 0 instead.
5. If the character two positions before is a tab, it increases `dist` by 1 plus the number of tabs in the character immediately before the current character, multiplied by 3.
6. It then replaces the current character at index `i` with the same character surrounded by square brackets (`[` and `]`).
7. After the loop, it joins the list of characters back into a string.
8. Finally, it expands tabs in the string by replacing each tab with spaces. The number of spaces is 4 plus the value of `dist`.

Now, let's apply these steps to the input `'\n\ny\n'`:

- The input string is converted to a list: `['\n', '\n', 'y', '\n']`.
- `dist` is initialized to 0.
- The loop will iterate over the indices 0, 1, and 2 (since the last character is excluded).
- For index 0:
  - There is no character two positions before, so it uses index 0, which is `'\n'`, not a tab.
  - The character at index 0 is replaced with `'[\n]'`.
- For index 1:
  - The character two positions before is now `'[\n]'`, not a tab.
  - The character at index 1 is replaced with `'[\n]'`.
- For index 2:
  - The character two positions before is `'\n'`, not a tab.
  - The character at index 2 is replaced with `'[y]'`.
- The list is now: `['[\n]', '[\n]', '[y]', '\n']`.
- The list is joined into a string: `'[\n][\n][y]\n'`.
- Since there are no tab characters in the string, the `expandtabs` method will not change the string.

Therefore, the output of the function f on the input `'\n\ny\n'` is `'[\n][\n][y]\n'`.
