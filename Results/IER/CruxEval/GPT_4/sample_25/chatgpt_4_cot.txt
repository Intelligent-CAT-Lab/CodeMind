<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input and performs the following steps:
1. It creates a copy of the input dictionary to avoid modifying the original dictionary.
2. It removes the last key-value pair from the copied dictionary using the popitem() method. The popitem() method removes and returns the last (key, value) pair as a 2-tuple. Since dictionaries are ordered as of Python 3.7, the last item is the one that was most recently added.
3. It returns the modified dictionary, which now has one less key-value pair.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `{"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}`, we need to follow these steps:
- Copy the dictionary `{"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}`.
- Remove the last key-value pair, which is `"x:": 3`.
- The resulting dictionary after the removal will be `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `{"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}` is `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`.
<<<Output>>>
{'l': 1, 't': 2}
