<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string st as input and checks if the first character of the string is a tilde ('~'). If it is, it right-justifies the string to a length of 10 characters, padding with 's' on the left, and then recursively calls itself with the new string. If the first character is not a tilde, it right-justifies the string to a length of 10 characters, padding with 'n' on the left, and returns the result.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'eqe-;ew22', we need to check the first character of the string. Since the first character is not a tilde, the function will right-justify the string to a length of 10 characters, padding with 'n' on the left.

The input string 'eqe-;ew22' is already 10 characters long, so no padding is needed, and the function will return the string as it is.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'eqe-;ew22' is 'eqe-;ew22'.

'eqe-;ew22'
