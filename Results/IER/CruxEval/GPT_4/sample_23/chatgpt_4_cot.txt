<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `text` and a string `chars`. It performs the following steps:

1. If `chars` is not empty, it strips characters from the end of `text` that are contained in `chars`.
2. If `chars` is empty, it strips whitespace characters from the end of `text`.
3. After stripping, if `text` is an empty string, it returns '-'.
4. Otherwise, it returns the modified `text`.

For the input `f('new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', '0123456789-')`, the following occurs:

- `chars` is '0123456789-', so the function will strip any of these characters from the end of `text`.
- The `text` is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2'. The function will strip '2.2' from the end because '2' is in `chars` and '.' is not a digit or a hyphen, so it stops there.
- The resulting `text` after stripping is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery '.
- This is not an empty string, so the function will return this modified `text`.

Therefore, the output will be 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery '.
