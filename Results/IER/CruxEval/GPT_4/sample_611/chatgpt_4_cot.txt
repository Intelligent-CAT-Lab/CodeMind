<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input and reverses the list in place.
The input list is `[-6, -2, 1, -3, 0, 1]`.
The slicing operation `nums[::-1]` creates a new list that is the reverse of `nums`.
The assignment `nums[:] =` replaces the entire content of the original list with the reversed list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `[-6, -2, 1, -3, 0, 1]` is `[1, 0, -3, 1, -2, -6]`.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 0, -3, 1, -2, -6]
