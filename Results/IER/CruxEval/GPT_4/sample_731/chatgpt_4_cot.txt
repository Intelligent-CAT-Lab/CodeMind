<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string 'text' and a string 'use'. It returns a new string that is the result of replacing all occurrences of the string 'use' in 'text' with an empty string ''.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday.' with 'use' being 'a', we need to remove all occurrences of 'a' from the input string.

The input string is 'Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday.' and we need to remove all 'a's from it. After removal, the string becomes 'Chris requires ride to the irport on Fridy.'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input is 'Chris requires ride to the irport on Fridy.'.
<<<Output>>>
'Chris requires ride to the irport on Fridy.'
