<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: input_string and spaces. The input_string is a raw string (denoted by the 'r' prefix) that contains a tab character represented by '\t', and spaces is an integer that specifies the number of spaces to replace each tab character with.

The method expandtabs() is called on the input_string. This method returns a copy of the string where all tab characters '\t' are replaced by the number of spaces specified by the spaces argument.

In this case, the input_string is 'a\tb' (with '\t' representing a tab character), and spaces is 4. Therefore, the tab character in the input_string will be replaced by 4 spaces.

The expected output of executing the function f on the input ('a\tb', 4) is 'a    b' (with 4 spaces between 'a' and 'b').
<<<Output>>>
'a    b'
