<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string title as input and returns the lowercase version of that string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '   Rock   Paper   SCISSORS  ', we need to convert the entire string to lowercase.
The input string has leading and trailing spaces, as well as spaces between the words, but the .lower() method only changes the case of the letters and does not remove or alter spaces.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '   Rock   Paper   SCISSORS  ' is the same string with all letters converted to lowercase, including the spaces as they are.
<<<Output>>>
'   rock   paper   scissors  '
