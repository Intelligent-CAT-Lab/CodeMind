<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and initializes an empty string result. It then iterates over each character in the input text.
For each character, it checks if the character is alphanumeric (consisting of letters and numbers) using the isalnum() method.
If the character is alphanumeric, it converts the character to uppercase using the upper() method and appends it to the result string.
If the character is not alphanumeric (such as spaces or punctuation), it is ignored and not added to the result string.
Let's process the input 'с bishop.Swift' step by step:
- 'с' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and added to result, making result 'С'.
- ' ' (space) is not alphanumeric, so it is ignored.
- 'b' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and added to result, making result 'СB'.
- 'i' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and added to result, making result 'СBI'.
- 's' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and added to result, making result 'СBIS'.
- 'h' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and added to result, making result 'СBISH'.
- 'o' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and added to result, making result 'СBISHO'.
- 'p' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and added to result, making result 'СBISHOP'.
- '.' (dot) is not alphanumeric, so it is ignored.
- 'S' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase (although it is already uppercase) and added to result, making result 'СBISHOPS'.
- 'w' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and added to result, making result 'СBISHOPSW'.
- 'i' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and added to result, making result 'СBISHOPSWI'.
- 'f' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and added to result, making result 'СBISHOPSWIF'.
- 't' is alphanumeric, so it is converted to uppercase and added to result, making result 'СBISHOPSWIFT'.
Finally, the function returns the result string 'СBISHOPSWIFT'.
<<<Output>>>
'СBISHOPSWIFT'
