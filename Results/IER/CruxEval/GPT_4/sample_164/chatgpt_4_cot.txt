<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and performs the following steps:
1. It sorts the list in ascending order using the sort() method.
2. It returns a new list containing the first three elements of the sorted list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 1, 3, 0], we need to follow these steps:
1. Sort the list: [0, 1, 3, 5, 8]
2. Slice the first three elements: [0, 1, 3]

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 1, 3, 0] is a list containing the elements [0, 1, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 3]
