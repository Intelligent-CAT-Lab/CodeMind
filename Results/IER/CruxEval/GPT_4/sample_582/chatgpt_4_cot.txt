<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, k and j. It initializes an empty list called arr. Then it enters a for loop that iterates k times (in this case, 7 times since k is 7). In each iteration, it appends the value of j (which is 5) to the list arr. After the loop finishes, the function returns the list arr.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs 7 and 5, we need to append the value 5 to the list arr seven times. The resulting list will contain seven elements, all of which are the number 5.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs 7 and 5 is a list containing seven 5s: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
