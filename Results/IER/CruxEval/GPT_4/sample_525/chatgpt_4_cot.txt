<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a dictionary c, and two integers st and ed. It initializes an empty dictionary d and two integer variables a and b to 0.

The function then iterates over the items in the dictionary c. For each key-value pair (x, y), it adds an entry to the dictionary d with y as the key and x as the value. This effectively inverts the key-value pairs from c to d.

During the iteration, the function also checks if y is equal to st or ed. If y is equal to st, it assigns the value of x to a. If y is equal to ed, it assigns the value of x to b.

After the loop, the function retrieves the value associated with the key st in the dictionary d and stores it in the variable w.

Finally, the function returns a tuple. If a is greater than b, it returns (w, b); otherwise, it returns (b, w).

Let's apply this logic to the given input `f({'TEXT': 7, 'CODE': 3}, 7, 3)`:

1. The dictionary c is `{'TEXT': 7, 'CODE': 3}`, st is 7, and ed is 3.
2. The loop iterates over the items in c:
   - For the first item ('TEXT', 7), d[7] is set to 'TEXT', and since y (7) is equal to st, a is set to 'TEXT'.
   - For the second item ('CODE', 3), d[3] is set to 'CODE', and since y (3) is equal to ed, b is set to 'CODE'.
3. After the loop, d is `{'TEXT': 7, 'CODE': 3}` inverted to `{7: 'TEXT', 3: 'CODE'}`.
4. The variable w is set to d[st], which is d[7], so w is 'TEXT'.
5. The function checks if a > b, which is 'TEXT' > 'CODE'. Since 'TEXT' and 'CODE' are strings, the comparison is lexicographical, and 'TEXT' is not greater than 'CODE'.
6. Therefore, the function returns (b, w), which is ('CODE', 'TEXT').

('CODE', 'TEXT')
