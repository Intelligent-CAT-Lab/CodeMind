<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array (list) as input and initializes an empty list called result. It also initializes an index variable to 0. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as the index is less than the length of the array.

Inside the while loop, the function appends the last element of the array to the result list using the pop() method, which also removes that element from the array. After appending to the result list, the index is incremented by 2.

Let's analyze the steps for the input `[8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8]`:
1. Initial array: [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8], result: [], index: 0
2. array.pop() -> 8, array: [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1], result: [8], index: 2
3. array.pop() -> -1, array: [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8], result: [8, -1], index: 4
4. array.pop() -> 8, array: [8, 8, -4, -9, 2], result: [8, -1, 8], index: 6
5. array.pop() -> 2, array: [8, 8, -4, -9], result: [8, -1, 8, 2], index: 8
6. The loop ends because index (8) is not less than len(array) (4).

The function then returns the result list.

<<<Output>>>
[8, -1, 8, 2]
