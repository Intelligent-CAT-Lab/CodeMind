<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: values, text, and markers. It returns the result of calling rstrip() method on the text twice, first with values and then with markers.

The rstrip() method removes any trailing characters (characters at the end of a string) that are passed as an argument. If the argument is an empty string, it defaults to removing whitespace.

In this case, the function is called with '2Pn' as values, 'yCxpg2C2Pny2' as text, and an empty string '' as markers.

First, the rstrip() method is called on 'yCxpg2C2Pny2' with '2Pn' as the argument. This will remove any trailing characters that are in '2Pn' from the end of 'yCxpg2C2Pny2'. The last character '2' is in '2Pn', so it is removed. The next character from the end 'y' is not in '2Pn', so the process stops here.

The intermediate result after the first rstrip() is 'yCxpg2C2Pny'.

Next, the rstrip() method is called on this intermediate result with an empty string '' as the argument. Since the argument is an empty string, no characters are removed.

Therefore, the final result is 'yCxpg2C2Pny'.
<<<Output>>>
'yCxpg2C2Pny'
