<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and initializes a boolean variable b to True. It then iterates over each character x in the input string text.

For each character x, the function checks if x is a digit using the isdigit() method:
- If x is a digit, it sets b to True (although b is already True, so this has no effect).
- If x is not a digit, it sets b to False and immediately breaks out of the loop.

The function returns the value of b after the loop.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "-1-3", we need to check each character:
- The first character is '-', which is not a digit, so b is set to False and the loop breaks.
- The function does not check the rest of the characters because the loop has been broken.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "-1-3" is False.
