<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input.
The first line of the function, d.clear(), clears all the items from the dictionary, leaving it empty.
Since the dictionary is passed by reference, the clear method affects the original dictionary that was passed in.
After clearing the dictionary, the function returns the now-empty dictionary.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 3, 'b': -1, 'c': 'Dum'} is an empty dictionary.
