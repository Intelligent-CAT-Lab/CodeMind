<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a string `text`, a character `lower`, and a character `upper`. It initializes a variable `count` to 0 and an empty list `new_text`. The function then iterates over each character in `text`.

For each character, it checks if the character is a decimal digit using the `isdecimal()` method. If it is, the character is replaced with the value of `lower`, otherwise, it is replaced with the value of `upper`.

After this replacement, the function checks if the new character is either 'p' or 'C'. If it is, it increments the `count` by 1.

The new character is then appended to the `new_text` list.

After iterating through all characters, the function returns a tuple containing the `count` and the new text as a string (obtained by joining all elements of `new_text`).

Now, let's process the input `f('DSUWeqExTQdCMGpqur', 'a', 'x')` step by step:

1. 'D' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.
2. 'S' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.
3. 'U' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.
4. 'W' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.
5. 'e' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.
6. 'q' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.
7. 'E' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.
8. 'x' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.
9. 'T' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.
10. 'Q' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.
11. 'd' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'a'.
12. 'C' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x' and count is incremented by 1.
13. 'M' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.
14. 'G' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.
15. 'p' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x' and count is incremented by 1.
16. 'q' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.
17. 'u' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.
18. 'r' is not a decimal, so it is replaced with 'x'.

The count of 'p' and 'C' characters is 2. The new text after replacement is "xxxxxxxxaxxxxxxxx".

The function returns a tuple with the count and the new text.
<<<Output>>>
(2, 'xxxxxxxxaxxxxxxxx')
