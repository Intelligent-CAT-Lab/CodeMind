<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `sample` as input and looks for the last occurrence of the character '/' before the last occurrence of the same character in the string.

1. The function initializes `i` to -1.
2. It enters a while loop that continues as long as the `find` method finds the character '/' in the string `sample` after the index `i+1`.
3. Inside the loop, `i` is updated to the index of the found '/' character.
4. Once the loop exits, it means no more '/' characters are found after the current index `i`.
5. The function then returns the index of the last occurrence of '/' before the index `i` using the `rindex` method.

Let's apply this logic to the input 'present/here/car%2Fwe':

- The first '/' is found at index 7, so `i` becomes 7.
- The second '/' is found at index 12, so `i` becomes 12.
- The third '/' is not found because the next character that looks like a '/' is actually '%2F', which is an encoded '/' and not treated as the character '/' by the `find` method.
- The loop exits, and the `rindex` method is called to find the last occurrence of '/' before index 12.
- The last occurrence of '/' before index 12 is at index 7.

Therefore, the function will return the index 7.
