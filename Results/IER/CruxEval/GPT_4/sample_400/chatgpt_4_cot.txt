<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string multi_string as input and performs the following steps:

1. It splits the input string into a list of words using the split() method.
2. It creates a map object cond_string that applies the str.isascii method to each word in the list. This will check if each word contains only ASCII characters.
3. It checks if there is any True value in the cond_string map object, which would indicate that there is at least one word that contains only ASCII characters.
4. If there is a True value, it joins the words that contain only ASCII characters with a comma and a space and returns the resulting string.
5. If there are no True values in cond_string, it returns an empty string.

For the input 'I am hungry! eat food.', the steps are as follows:

1. The input string is split into the list ['I', 'am', 'hungry!', 'eat', 'food.'].
2. The map object cond_string will contain [True, True, True, True, True] because all the words contain only ASCII characters.
3. Since there is a True value in cond_string, the function will proceed to join the words that are ASCII.
4. All the words are ASCII, so it will join all of them with ', '.
5. The resulting string will be 'I, am, hungry!, eat, food.'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'I am hungry! eat food.' is 'I, am, hungry!, eat, food.'.
<<<Output>>>
'I, am, hungry!, eat, food.'
