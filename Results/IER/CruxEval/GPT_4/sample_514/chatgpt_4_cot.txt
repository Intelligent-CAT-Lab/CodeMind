<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string `text` as input and processes it as follows:

1. It splits the input string `text` by spaces into a list of words.
2. For each word in the list, it performs two replace operations on the original `text` string:
   a. It replaces '-{word}' with a single space ' '.
   b. It replaces '{word}-' with a single space ' '.
3. After processing all words, it returns the modified `text` string with leading and trailing '-' characters stripped.

Let's apply these steps to the input string '-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.':

- The input string is split into the following words: ['stew', 'corn', 'and', 'beans', 'in', 'soup', '.']
- The replace operations are performed for each word:
  - For 'stew': No '-stew' or 'stew-' patterns are found, so no replacements occur.
  - For 'corn': The pattern '-corn-' is found and replaced with ' '.
  - For 'and': The pattern '-and-' is found and replaced with ' '.
  - For 'beans': The pattern '-beans-' is found and replaced with ' '.
  - For 'in': No '-in' or 'in-' patterns are found, so no replacements occur.
  - For 'soup': No '-soup' or 'soup-' patterns are found, so no replacements occur.
  - For '.': No '-.' or '.-' patterns are found, so no replacements occur.
- The resulting string after all replacements is '-stew   corn and beans in soup-.-'
- Finally, the strip('-') operation removes leading and trailing '-' characters, resulting in 'stew   corn and beans in soup-.'

Note that the extra spaces between 'stew' and 'corn' are not removed by the function, as it only replaces specific patterns involving hyphens and does not address multiple consecutive spaces.

<<<Output>>>
'stew   corn and beans in soup-.'
