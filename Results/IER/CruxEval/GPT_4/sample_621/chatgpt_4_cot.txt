<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: a string `text` and a string `encoding`. It attempts to encode the `text` using the specified `encoding`.

The input provided to the function f is the string '13:45:56' and the encoding 'shift_jis'.

The function will attempt to encode the string '13:45:56' using the 'shift_jis' encoding. Since 'shift_jis' is a valid encoding for Japanese characters, and the string '13:45:56' contains only ASCII characters which are also valid in 'shift_jis', the encoding process should succeed without raising an exception.

Therefore, the function should return the encoded bytes of the string '13:45:56' in 'shift_jis' encoding.
<<<Output>>>
b'13:45:56'
