<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list called nums and an integer i. The function removes the element at index i from the list nums using the pop method and then returns the modified list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47] with i being 0, we need to remove the element at index 0 from the list. The element at index 0 is 35.
After removing the element 35, the remaining list will be [45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input is [45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47].
<<<Output>>>
[45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]
