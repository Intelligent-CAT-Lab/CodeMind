The function f takes a string txt as input and creates a dictionary called coincidences to count the occurrences of each character in the string.

1. The function initializes an empty dictionary coincidences.
2. It then iterates over each character c in the input string "11 1 1".
3. For each character, it checks if the character is already a key in the dictionary coincidences.
4. If the character is already a key, it increments the value associated with that key by 1.
5. If the character is not a key, it adds the character as a key to the dictionary with the value 1.
6. After iterating through all characters, the function returns the sum of all values in the dictionary coincidences.

Let's process the input "11 1 1":
- The first character '1' is not in the dictionary, so it is added with the value 1: {'1': 1}
- The second character '1' is already in the dictionary, so its count is incremented: {'1': 2}
- The third character ' ' (space) is not in the dictionary, so it is added with the value 1: {'1': 2, ' ': 1}
- The fourth character '1' is already in the dictionary, so its count is incremented: {'1': 3, ' ': 1}
- The fifth character ' ' (space) is already in the dictionary, so its count is incremented: {'1': 3, ' ': 2}
- The sixth character '1' is already in the dictionary, so its count is incremented: {'1': 4, ' ': 2}

Finally, the function returns the sum of the values in the dictionary coincidences, which is 4 (for '1') + 2 (for ' ') = 6.
