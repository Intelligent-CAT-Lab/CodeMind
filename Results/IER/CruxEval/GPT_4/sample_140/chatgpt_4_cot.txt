<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string st as input and performs the following operations:
1. It converts the string to lowercase using st.lower().
2. It finds the last index of the character 'i' in the lowercase string using st.lower().rindex('i').
3. It finds the last index of the character 'h' in the lowercase string, but starting the search from the last index of 'i' found in step 2, using st.lower().rindex('h', st.lower().rindex('i')).
4. It compares if the last index of 'h' is greater than or equal to the last index of 'i'.
5. If the condition is true, it returns 'Hey', otherwise, it returns 'Hi'.

For the input 'Hi there':
- The lowercase version is 'hi there'.
- The last index of 'i' is 1.
- The last index of 'h' starting from index 1 is 1.
- Since the last index of 'h' (1) is equal to the last index of 'i' (1), the condition is true.
- Therefore, the function should return 'Hey'.

'Hey'
