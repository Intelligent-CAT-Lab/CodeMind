<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input and processes it as follows:
1. It iterates over the list in reverse order using a for loop with the range starting from the last index (len(nums)-1) to 0 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.
2. During each iteration, it checks if the current number (nums[i]) is odd by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is 1 (nums[i] % 2 == 1).
3. If the current number is odd, it inserts a copy of this number immediately after the current position (i+1) in the list.
4. The function returns the modified list after the loop completes.

Let's apply this logic to the input list [2, 3, 4, 6, -2]:
- Start with the last element (-2): it is even, so no action is taken.
- Move to the element before the last (6): it is even, so no action is taken.
- Move to the third element from the end (4): it is even, so no action is taken.
- Move to the second element from the end (3): it is odd, so we insert a copy of 3 after the current position.
  The list now becomes [2, 3, 3, 4, 6, -2].
- Move to the first element (2): it is even, so no action is taken.

The loop has now completed, and the function returns the modified list.

<<<Output>>>
[2, 3, 3, 4, 6, -2]
