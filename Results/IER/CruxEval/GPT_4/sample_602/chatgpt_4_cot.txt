<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of numbers called nums and a number called target.
The function counts how many times the target number appears in the nums list using the count method.
For the input `f([1, 1], 1)`, the target number is 1.
The count of the number 1 in the list [1, 1] is 2, since there are two occurrences of 1 in the list.
The function then returns the count multiplied by 2.
Therefore, the return value is 2 (the count) multiplied by 2, which equals 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
