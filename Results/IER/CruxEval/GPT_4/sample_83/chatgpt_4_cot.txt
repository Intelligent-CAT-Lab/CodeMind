<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string `text` as input and performs the following steps:

1. It uses the `rpartition` method to split the string into a tuple of three elements: the part before the last occurrence of '0', the '0' itself, and the part after the '0'.
2. It checks if the third element of the tuple (the part after the '0') is an empty string. If it is, the function returns the string '-1:-1'.
3. If the third element is not empty, it calculates the length of the first element (the part before the '0') and finds the index of the first occurrence of '0' in the third element, adding 1 to it (since string indices are 0-based).
4. It then returns a formatted string with the length of the first element and the adjusted index of '0' in the third element, separated by a colon.

For the input 'qq0tt', the steps are as follows:

1. The `rpartition` method will split 'qq0tt' into ('qq', '0', 'tt').
2. The third element 'tt' is not an empty string, so we proceed to the next step.
3. The length of the first element 'qq' is 2.
4. The third element 'tt' does not contain a '0', so `find("0")` will return -1. Adding 1 to this gives 0.
5. The function will return the formatted string '2:0'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'qq0tt' is '2:0'.
