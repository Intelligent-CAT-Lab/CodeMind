The function f takes a dictionary d as input and processes it to create a list of strings that represent the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

1. An empty list called keys is initialized.
2. The function then iterates over each key in the dictionary d.
3. For each key, it appends a string to the keys list. This string is formatted as 'key => value', where key is the current key from the dictionary and value is the corresponding value for that key in the dictionary.
4. The dictionary provided as input is {'-4':'4','1':'2','-':'-3'}.
5. The iteration will occur in the order the keys appear in the dictionary (note that dictionaries maintain insertion order since Python 3.7).
6. The first iteration will process the key '-4' and its value '4', resulting in the string '-4 => 4' being appended to the keys list.
7. The second iteration will process the key '1' and its value '2', resulting in the string '1 => 2' being appended to the keys list.
8. The third iteration will process the key '-' and its value '-3', resulting in the string '- => -3' being appended to the keys list.
9. After all iterations, the keys list will contain the strings ['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3'].
10. The function returns this list of strings.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'-4':'4','1':'2','-':'-3'} is the list ['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3'].
<<<Output>>>
['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3']
