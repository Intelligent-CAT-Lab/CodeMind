<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following steps:
1. It calculates the length of the input string and stores it in the variable length.
2. It initializes an index variable to 0.
3. It enters a while loop that continues as long as index is less than length and the character at the current index is a whitespace character (checked using text[index].isspace()).
4. Inside the loop, if the character at the current index is a whitespace, the index is incremented by 1.
5. Once a non-whitespace character is found or the end of the string is reached, the loop exits.
6. The function then returns a substring of text starting from the current index and spanning 5 characters (text[index:index+5]).

For the input '-----\t\n\tth\n-----':
- The length of the string is 17.
- The while loop will skip the first 5 hyphens, the tab character '\t', the newline character '\n', and the second tab character '\t'.
- The index will be at position 8 when the first non-whitespace character 't' is encountered.
- The function will then return the substring starting from index 8 and spanning 5 characters, which includes 'th\n--'.

Therefore, the output will be 'th\n--'.
