<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list called array as input and performs the following operations:
1. It creates a copy of the input list to avoid modifying the original list.
2. It reverses the order of the elements in the copied list.
3. It then multiplies each element in the reversed list by 2 using a list comprehension.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, we follow these steps:
- The original list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is copied.
- The copied list is reversed, resulting in `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- Each element in the reversed list is multiplied by 2, resulting in `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`.
