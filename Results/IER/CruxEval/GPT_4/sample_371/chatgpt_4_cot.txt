<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input and performs the following steps:

1. It iterates over a copy of the input list `nums[:]` to remove all odd numbers from the original list `nums`. The condition `if odd % 2 != 0` checks if a number is odd, and if so, it is removed from `nums`.

2. After the first loop, all odd numbers will have been removed from the list `nums`. The remaining numbers in `nums` will be even numbers or zero.

3. The second loop calculates the sum of the remaining numbers in `nums` by initializing `sum_` to 0 and then adding each number in `nums` to `sum_`.

For the input `[11, 21, 0, 11]`, the function will process as follows:

- The first loop will remove all odd numbers, which are 11, 21, and 11. The list `nums` will be left with just `[0]`.

- The second loop will sum the remaining numbers in `nums`, which is just 0.

Therefore, the return value of `f([11, 21, 0, 11])` will be the sum of the remaining numbers, which is 0.
