<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and performs the following steps:
1. It creates a dictionary d using the `dict.fromkeys` method, with keys from the string s and initial values set to 0. This method creates a new dictionary with keys from s and all values set to the initial value (0 in this case). If there are duplicate characters in the string, they will be merged into a single key because dictionary keys are unique.
2. It then returns a list of the keys of the dictionary d using `list(d.keys())`.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "12ab23xy", we need to follow these steps:
- The string "12ab23xy" is used to create the dictionary keys. Since dictionaries cannot have duplicate keys, the second occurrence of '2' and '3' will not be added again.
- The resulting dictionary keys will be '1', '2', 'a', 'b', '3', 'x', 'y' in the order they first appear in the string.
- The list of these keys is returned.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "12ab23xy" is ['1', '2', 'a', 'b', '3', 'x', 'y'].
<<<Output>>>
['1', '2', 'a', 'b', '3', 'x', 'y']
