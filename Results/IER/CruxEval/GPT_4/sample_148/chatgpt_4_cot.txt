<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string 'forest' and a string 'animal' which is a single character. The function finds the index of 'animal' in 'forest', creates a list of characters from 'forest', and then shifts every character after the found 'animal' one position to the left in the list. The last character is replaced with a '-'.

Let's go through the steps for the input `f('2imo 12 tfiqr.', 'm')`:

1. The index of 'm' in 'forest' is found using `forest.index(animal)`. In the string '2imo 12 tfiqr.', 'm' is at index 3.
2. A list of characters from 'forest' is created and stored in 'result'.
3. A while loop starts, which will run as long as 'index' is less than `len(forest)-1`.
4. Inside the loop, each character from the position after 'index' is copied to the position of 'index'.
5. The 'index' is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs.
6. Once 'index' reaches `len(forest)-1`, the loop stops.
7. The last character in 'result' is replaced with '-'.
8. The list 'result' is joined into a string and returned.

For the given input, the steps would be:

- 'm' is at index 3.
- The list of characters will be ['2', 'i', 'm', 'o', ' ', '1', '2', ' ', 't', 'f', 'i', 'q', 'r', '.'].
- The while loop will run, and the characters will be shifted:
  - After first iteration: ['2', 'i', 'o', ' ', '1', '2', ' ', 't', 'f', 'i', 'q', 'r', '.', '-']
  - The loop stops as the index is now at the last character.
- The final list is ['2', 'i', 'o', ' ', '1', '2', ' ', 't', 'f', 'i', 'q', 'r', '.', '-'].
- The list is joined to form the final string.
