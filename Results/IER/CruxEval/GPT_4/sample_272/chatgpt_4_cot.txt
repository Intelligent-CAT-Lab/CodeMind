<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: base_list and nums. It performs the following steps:

1. It extends the base_list with the elements of nums using the extend() method. After this step, base_list becomes [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0].

2. It creates a copy of the extended base_list and assigns it to the variable res. The res list is now also [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0].

3. It then enters a for loop that iterates from -len(nums) to 0. Since len(nums) is 5, the range will be from -5 to 0 (not including 0). This will iterate over the last 5 elements of the res list.

4. During each iteration, it appends the element at the current negative index to the end of the res list. This means it will append the last 5 elements of the res list to itself in the same order.

After the loop, the res list will have the following elements:
[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]

5. The function then returns the res list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ([9, 7, 5, 3, 1], [2, 4, 6, 8, 0]) will be [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0].
<<<Output>>>
[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]
