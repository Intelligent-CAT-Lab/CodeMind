<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string x as input and checks whether all characters in the string are digits.

1. The length of the input string '1' is calculated and stored in the variable n, which is 1.
2. A variable i is initialized to 0.
3. The while loop starts and checks two conditions: whether i < n (0 < 1) and whether x[i] (the first character of '1') is a digit.
4. Since both conditions are true, the loop increments i by 1. Now i is equal to 1.
5. The loop checks the conditions again: i < n (1 < 1) is false, so the loop terminates.
6. The function returns whether i is equal to n (1 == 1), which is true.

Therefore, the function will return True because all characters in the input string '1' are digits.
<<<Output>>>
True
