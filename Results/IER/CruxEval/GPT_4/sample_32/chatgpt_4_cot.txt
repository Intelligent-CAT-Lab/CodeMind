<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `s` and a string `sep` which is used as a separator for splitting the string `s`.
The function performs the following steps:
1. It splits the string `s` using the separator `sep`. In this case, `s` is 'volume' and `sep` is 'l', so the split operation will result in a list where 'volume' is split at 'l', producing ['vo', 'ume'].
2. It then creates a new list by iterating over the split list and prepending each element with an asterisk '*'. The new list will be ['*vo', '*ume'].
3. The list is then reversed, resulting in ['*ume', '*vo'].
4. Finally, the elements of the reversed list are joined together into a single string with a semicolon ';' as the separator, resulting in '*ume;*vo'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('volume', 'l') is '*ume;*vo'.

'*ume;*vo'
