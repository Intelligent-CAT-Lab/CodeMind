The function `f` takes two arguments: a `text` string and a `search_string`. It initializes an empty list called `indexes`. Then, it enters a while loop that continues as long as the `search_string` is found within the `text`.

Inside the loop, the function appends the rightmost index of `search_string` in `text` to the `indexes` list using `text.rindex(search_string)`. After that, it updates the `text` string to be everything up to (but not including) the found index of `search_string`.

Let's break down the steps for the input `f('ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ', 'J')`:

1. The initial `text` is 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ', and we are searching for 'J'.
2. The rightmost 'J' is at index 26. Append 26 to `indexes` and update `text` to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHB'.
3. The next rightmost 'J' is at index 17. Append 17 to `indexes` and update `text` to 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNC'.
4. The next rightmost 'J' is at index 13. Append 13 to `indexes` and update `text` to 'ONBPICJOHRHD'.
5. The next rightmost 'J' is at index 8. Append 8 to `indexes` and update `text` to 'ONBPICJO'.
6. There are no more 'J's in the `text`, so the loop ends.

The final `indexes` list is [26, 17, 13, 8].

[26, 17, 13, 8]
