<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: text and chars. It returns the result of calling the rstrip method on text with chars as the argument if text is not an empty string; otherwise, it returns text as it is.

In this case, the input to the function f is 'ha' for text and an empty string '' for chars.

Since the text parameter 'ha' is not an empty string, the function will attempt to strip characters from the end of 'ha' that are contained in chars. However, since chars is an empty string, there are no characters to remove from the end of 'ha'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'ha' and '' is 'ha' unchanged.
<<<Output>>>
'ha'
