<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer n as input and initializes an empty string called streak. It then converts the integer n to a string to iterate over each character (digit) in the string representation of n.

For each character c in the string representation of n, it performs the following operations:
1. Converts the character c to an integer to determine how many times to repeat the space padding.
2. Uses the ljust method to pad the character c with spaces to the right, making the total length of the string equal to the integer value of c multiplied by 2.

Since the input to the function is the integer 1, the string representation of n is "1". The function will iterate over this single character.

For the character '1', the integer value is 1. The ljust method will be called with the argument 1 * 2, which is 2. This means the character '1' will be left-justified with a total length of 2, effectively adding one space to the right of '1'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 1 is the string '1' followed by one space.

'1 '
