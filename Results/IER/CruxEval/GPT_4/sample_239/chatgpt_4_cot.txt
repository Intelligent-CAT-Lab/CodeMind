<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `text` and a string `froms`. It performs the following operations:
1. `text.lstrip(froms)`: This removes all characters found in `froms` from the beginning (left side) of `text`.
2. `text.rstrip(froms)`: This removes all characters found in `froms` from the end (right side) of `text`.

The input to the function is `f('0 t 1cos ', 'st ' + '0\t\n  ')`. The second argument is a concatenation of two strings: 'st ' and '0\t\n  '. This results in a string that contains the characters 's', 't', ' ', '0', '\t' (tab), '\n' (newline), and ' ' (space).

When the function is called, the following steps occur:
1. `text.lstrip(froms)`: All leading characters that are in `froms` are stripped from `text`. In this case, '0', ' ', and '\t' are stripped from the beginning of '0 t 1cos ', resulting in 't 1cos '.
2. `text.rstrip(froms)`: All trailing characters that are in `froms` are stripped from `text`. In this case, ' ', 's', and 't' are stripped from the end of 't 1cos ', resulting in 't 1co'.

Therefore, the return value of the function will be 't 1co'.
