<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list called array as input and initializes an empty list called result.
It then iterates over each element in the array list.
For each element, it checks two conditions using an or operator:
1. If the element is an ASCII character (elem.isascii()).
2. If the element is an integer and the absolute value of the integer converted to a string is not an ASCII character (isinstance(elem, int) and not str(abs(elem)).isascii()).

If either of these conditions is true, the element is appended to the result list.

In the given input `["a", "b", "c"]`, all elements are ASCII characters, so all of them satisfy the first condition.
Therefore, all elements will be appended to the result list.

The output of executing the function f on the input `["a", "b", "c"]` is the list `["a", "b", "c"]` itself.
<<<Output>>>
['a', 'b', 'c']
