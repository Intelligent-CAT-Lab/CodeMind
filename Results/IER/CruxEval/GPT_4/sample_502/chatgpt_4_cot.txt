<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string name as input and performs two operations on it:
1. It splits the string into a list of words using the split method with a space character (' ') as the delimiter. For the input 'Fred Smith', this results in the list ['Fred', 'Smith'].
2. It then joins the elements of this list into a single string, with each element separated by an asterisk ('*'). This is done using the join method with '*' as the separator.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'Fred Smith' is the string 'Fred*Smith', where 'Fred' and 'Smith' are joined by an asterisk.
<<<Output>>>
'Fred*Smith'
