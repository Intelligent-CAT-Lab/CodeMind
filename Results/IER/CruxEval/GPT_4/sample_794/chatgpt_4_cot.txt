<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string line as input and initializes an empty list a. It then iterates over each character c in the input string line.

For each character c, it checks if the character is alphanumeric (consisting of letters and numbers) using the isalnum() method. If the character is alphanumeric, it appends the character to the list a.

After iterating through all characters, it joins the list a into a string using the join() method and returns the resulting string.

Let's analyze the input string "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'":
- The first two characters are backslashes, which are not alphanumeric, so they are not added to the list.
- The next two characters are a percent sign and a dollar sign, which are also not alphanumeric, so they are not added to the list.
- The space and the word "normal" are added to the list since they are alphanumeric (spaces are not, but the letters are).
- The space and the word "chars" are added to the list for the same reason.
- The dollar sign, percent sign, and tilde are not alphanumeric, so they are not added to the list.
- The space and the word "qwet42" are added to the list since they are alphanumeric.
- The single quote at the end is not alphanumeric, so it is not added to the list.

The resulting list a will contain the characters: ['n', 'o', 'r', 'm', 'a', 'l', ' ', 'c', 'h', 'a', 'r', 's', ' ', 'q', 'w', 'e', 't', '4', '2'].

Joining these characters into a string results in "normal chars qwet42".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'" is "normal chars qwet42".
<<<Output>>>
'normal chars qwet42'
