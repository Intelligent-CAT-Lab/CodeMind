<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes three arguments: a string `text`, a substring `substr`, and an integer `occ` representing the occurrence of the substring we want to find.

The function uses a while loop to find the `occ`-th occurrence of `substr` in `text` from the end (right side) of the string. It does this by using the `rfind` method, which returns the highest index of the substring if found, otherwise -1.

Here's the step-by-step analysis for `f('zjegiymjc', 'j', 2)`:

1. Initialize `n` to 0, which will count the occurrences of `substr`.
2. Enter the while loop.
3. Use `rfind` to find the last occurrence of 'j' in 'zjegiymjc', which is at index 6.
4. Check if `i` is -1. It is not, so continue.
5. Check if `n` is equal to `occ` (2). It is not (n is 0), so continue.
6. Increment `n` by 1 (n becomes 1).
7. Update `text` to be the substring from the start to the index of the found 'j', which is 'zjegiy'.
8. Repeat the loop.
9. Use `rfind` to find the last occurrence of 'j' in 'zjegiy', which is at index 1.
10. Check if `i` is -1. It is not, so continue.
11. Check if `n` is equal to `occ` (2). It is now (n is 1 and we increment it to 2), so return the index `i`, which is 1.

Therefore, the function will return the index 1, which is the position of the second occurrence of 'j' from the end of the original string 'zjegiymjc'.
