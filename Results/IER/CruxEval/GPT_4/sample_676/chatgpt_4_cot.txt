<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `text` and an integer `tab_size`. It returns a new string where every tab character ('\t') in `text` is replaced with a number of spaces equal to `tab_size`.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'a' and 100, we need to check if there are any tab characters in the string 'a'. Since there are no tab characters in 'a', the replace function will not change anything, and the original string 'a' will be returned as is.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'a' and 100 is simply 'a'.
<<<Output>>>
'a'
