The function `f` takes two arguments: `original` and `string`. Both are dictionaries.

1. A temporary dictionary `temp` is created as a copy of `original`.
2. The function then iterates over the items in the `string` dictionary.
3. For each key-value pair `(a, b)` in `string`, it sets the value of key `b` in `temp` to `a`.
4. After the loop, the modified `temp` dictionary is returned.

Let's apply these steps to the given input:

- The `original` dictionary is `{1: -9, 0: -7}`.
- The `string` dictionary is `{1: 2, 0: 3}`.

The function will perform the following operations:

1. Create a copy of `original` in `temp`: `temp = {1: -9, 0: -7}`.
2. Iterate over `string.items()`:
   - First iteration: `a = 1`, `b = 2`. Set `temp[2] = 1`.
   - Second iteration: `a = 0`, `b = 3`. Set `temp[3] = 0`.
3. The final `temp` dictionary is `{1: -9, 0: -7, 2: 1, 3: 0}`.

Therefore, the return value of the function `f` with the given input will be `{1: -9, 0: -7, 2: 1, 3: 0}`.
<<<Output>>>
{1: -9, 0: -7, 2: 1, 3: 0}
