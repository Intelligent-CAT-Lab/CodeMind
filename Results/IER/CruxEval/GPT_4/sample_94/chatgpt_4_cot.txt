<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two dictionaries a and b as input and returns a new dictionary that is the result of merging the two dictionaries. The merging is done using the unpacking operator (**).

The first dictionary a has two key-value pairs: 'w': 5 and 'wi': 10.
The second dictionary b has one key-value pair: 'w': 3.

When the dictionaries are merged, the key 'w' from dictionary b will overwrite the value of the key 'w' in dictionary a because it appears later in the merged dictionary creation.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'w': 5, 'wi': 10} and {'w': 3} is a new dictionary with the key 'w' having the value 3 (from dictionary b) and the key 'wi' having the value 10 (from dictionary a).
<<<Output>>>
{'w': 3, 'wi': 10}
