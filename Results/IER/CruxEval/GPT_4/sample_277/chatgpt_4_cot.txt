<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list lst and a boolean mode.
First, it creates a new list result which is a copy of the input list lst.
Then, it checks if mode is True (since 1 is truthy in Python, it will be considered True).
Because mode is 1, which is truthy, the if condition is satisfied.
The function then calls the reverse() method on the result list, which reverses the list in place.
Therefore, the original list [1, 2, 3, 4] will be reversed to [4, 3, 2, 1].
Finally, the function returns the reversed list.
<<<Output>>>
[4, 3, 2, 1]
