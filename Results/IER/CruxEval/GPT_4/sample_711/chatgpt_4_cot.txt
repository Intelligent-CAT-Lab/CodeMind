<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string where all occurrences of the newline character '\n' are replaced with the tab character '\t'.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'apples\n\t\npears\n\t\nbananas', we need to replace each '\n' with '\t'.

The input string is 'apples\n\t\npears\n\t\nbananas'. Here is how the replacement will occur:
- The first '\n' after 'apples' will be replaced with '\t'.
- The second '\n' after '\t' will be replaced with '\t'.
- The third '\n' after 'pears' will be replaced with '\t'.
- The fourth '\n' after '\t' will be replaced with '\t'.
- The fifth '\n' after 'bananas' does not exist, so no more replacements are needed.

After all replacements, the resulting string will be 'apples\t\t\tpears\t\t\tbananas'.
<<<Output>>>
'apples\t\t\tpears\t\t\tbananas'
