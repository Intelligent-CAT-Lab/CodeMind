<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string called tokens as input and processes it as follows:

1. The input string 'gsd avdropj' is split into a list of words using the split() method. The resulting list is ['gsd', 'avdropj'].

2. The length of the list is checked. If it contains exactly 2 elements, the list is reversed. In this case, the list does contain 2 elements, so it is reversed to ['avdropj', 'gsd'].

3. The first element of the list 'avdropj' is left-justified to a width of 5 characters using ljust(5). Since 'avdropj' is longer than 5 characters, it remains unchanged.

4. The second element of the list 'gsd' is also left-justified to a width of 5 characters using ljust(5). Since 'gsd' is shorter than 5 characters, it is padded with spaces to the right to make it 5 characters long, resulting in 'gsd  '.

5. The two left-justified strings are joined together with a space between them, resulting in 'avdropj gsd  '.

6. This final string is returned as the result of the function.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'gsd avdropj' is 'avdropj gsd  '.
