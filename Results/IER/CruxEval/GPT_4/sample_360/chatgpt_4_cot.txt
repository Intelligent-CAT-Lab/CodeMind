<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `text` and an integer `n`.
The function first checks if the length of `text` is less than or equal to 2. If it is, the function returns `text` as it is.
In this case, the input string is 'g', which has a length of 1, which is less than or equal to 2.
Therefore, the condition is met, and the function will return the input string 'g' without any modifications.
<<<Output>>>
'g'
