<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes three parameters: a list of numbers `nums`, and two integers `odd1` and `odd2`. The function removes all occurrences of `odd1` and `odd2` from the list `nums`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the function execution with the given input:

1. The list `nums` is `[1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3]`.
2. The value of `odd1` is `3`.
3. The value of `odd2` is `1`.
4. The first `while` loop removes all occurrences of `odd1` (which is `3`) from `nums`.
5. After the first `while` loop, `nums` becomes `[1, 2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 21, 1]`.
6. The second `while` loop removes all occurrences of `odd2` (which is `1`) from `nums`.
7. After the second `while` loop, `nums` becomes `[2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 21]`.
8. The function returns the modified list `nums`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the given input is `[2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 21]`.
