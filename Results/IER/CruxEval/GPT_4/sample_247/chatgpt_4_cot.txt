<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and performs the following checks:
1. It checks if the string contains only alphabetic characters using the isalpha() method.
2. If the string is empty, it returns "str is empty".
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, it returns "no".

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Boolean", we need to check if "Boolean" contains only alphabetic characters. Since "Boolean" is composed entirely of alphabetic characters, the isalpha() method will return True.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "Boolean" is "yes".
<<<Output>>>
'yes'
