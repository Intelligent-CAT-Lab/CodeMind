<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: a string `text`, a character `fill`, and an integer `size`.

1. The function first checks if `size` is negative. If it is, it converts `size` to a positive value by negating it. In this case, `size` is 1, which is not negative, so this step is skipped.

2. Next, the function checks if the length of `text` is greater than `size`. If it is, the function returns the last `size` characters of `text`. Since `size` is 1 and the length of `text` ('no asw') is greater than 1, this condition is true.

3. The function will return the last character of `text` because `size` is 1. The last character of 'no asw' is 'w'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'no asw', 'j', and 1 is 'w'.
