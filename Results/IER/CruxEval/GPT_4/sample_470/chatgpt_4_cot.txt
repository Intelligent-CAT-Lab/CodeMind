<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer number as input and returns a list of keys from the dictionary transl where the corresponding value is divisible by the input number without a remainder.

The dictionary transl maps letters 'A' to 'E' to the integers 1 to 5, respectively.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 2, we need to iterate over each item in the dictionary and check if the value is divisible by 2.

- 'A': 1 is not divisible by 2, so 'A' is not added to the result list.
- 'B': 2 is divisible by 2, so 'B' is added to the result list.
- 'C': 3 is not divisible by 2, so 'C' is not added to the result list.
- 'D': 4 is divisible by 2, so 'D' is added to the result list.
- 'E': 5 is not divisible by 2, so 'E' is not added to the result list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 2 is a list containing 'B' and 'D'.

['B', 'D']
