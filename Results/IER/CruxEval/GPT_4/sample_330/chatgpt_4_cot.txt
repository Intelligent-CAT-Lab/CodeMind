<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and initializes an empty list ans. It then iterates over each character in the input string.

For each character in the string 'm4n2o':
- If the character is a digit (as checked by the char.isdigit() method), it is appended to the ans list.
- If the character is not a digit, a space character ' ' is appended to the ans list instead.

The process for the input 'm4n2o' is as follows:
- 'm' is not a digit, so ' ' is appended to ans.
- '4' is a digit, so '4' is appended to ans.
- 'n' is not a digit, so ' ' is appended to ans.
- '2' is a digit, so '2' is appended to ans.
- 'o' is not a digit, so ' ' is appended to ans.

After the loop, the ans list contains [' ', '4', ' ', '2', ' '].

The ''.join(ans) method is then used to join the elements of the ans list into a single string with no delimiter between elements.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'm4n2o' is ' 4 2 '.
