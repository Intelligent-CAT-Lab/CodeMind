<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a string `text`, a character `char`, and a string `replace`. It returns a new string where all occurrences of `char` in `text` are replaced with `replace`.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'a1a8', '1', and 'n2', we need to replace all occurrences of '1' in 'a1a8' with 'n2'.

The string 'a1a8' contains '1' at the second position. Replacing '1' with 'n2' will result in the string 'an2a8'.
<<<Output>>>
'an2a8'
