<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three numbers as input: num1, num2, and num3.
In this case, the input numbers are 6, 8, and 8, respectively.
The function creates a list nums containing the three numbers.
The list nums is then sorted in ascending order using the sort() method.
After sorting, the list nums will be [6, 8, 8] because the sort() method sorts the list in place.
The function then returns a formatted string with the sorted numbers separated by commas.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (6, 8, 8) is "6,8,8".
<<<Output>>>
'6,8,8'
