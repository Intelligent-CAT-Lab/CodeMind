<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a list called nums, an integer called spot, and another integer called idx.
The function inserts the value of idx into the list nums at the position indicated by spot.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([1, 0, 1, 1], 0, 9), we need to insert the value 9 at the 0th index (the beginning) of the list [1, 0, 1, 1].
After the insertion, the list will be [9, 1, 0, 1, 1].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input is [9, 1, 0, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[9, 1, 0, 1, 1]
