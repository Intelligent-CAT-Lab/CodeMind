<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of numbers (nums) and a value (val).
The function initializes an empty list called new_list.
It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in nums.
For each number i in nums, it extends new_list by a list containing i repeated val times.
After the list comprehension, new_list will contain each number from nums repeated val times.
Finally, the function returns the sum of all elements in new_list.

For the input `f([10, 4], 3)`, the steps are as follows:
1. nums is [10, 4] and val is 3.
2. new_list is initialized to [].
3. The list comprehension iterates over nums:
   - First iteration: i is 10, so [10] * 3 is [10, 10, 10], and new_list becomes [10, 10, 10].
   - Second iteration: i is 4, so [4] * 3 is [4, 4, 4], and new_list becomes [10, 10, 10, 4, 4, 4].
4. The sum of new_list [10, 10, 10, 4, 4, 4] is calculated: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42.

Therefore, the return value of `f([10, 4], 3)` is 42.
