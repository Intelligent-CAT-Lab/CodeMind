<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of numbers called nums and a single number called number. It returns the count of how many times the number appears in the list nums.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([12, 0, 13, 4, 12], 12), we need to count how many times the number 12 appears in the list [12, 0, 13, 4, 12].
In the given list, the number 12 appears twice.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ([12, 0, 13, 4, 12], 12) is 2.
