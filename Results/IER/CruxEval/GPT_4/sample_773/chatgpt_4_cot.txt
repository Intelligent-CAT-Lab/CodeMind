<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list called nums and an integer n. It returns the element at index n of the list nums by using the pop method, which also removes the element from the list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `[-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4]` and `6`, we need to pop the element at index 6 from the list.

The list has the following elements with their corresponding indices:
- Index 0: -7
- Index 1: 3
- Index 2: 1
- Index 3: -1
- Index 4: -1
- Index 5: 0
- Index 6: 4

The element at index 6 is the number 4. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input will be the number 4, and it will be removed from the list.
