<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string sentence as input and performs the following operations:
1. Checks if the input sentence is an empty string. If it is, it returns an empty string.
2. Removes all occurrences of the character '(' from the sentence.
3. Removes all occurrences of the character ')' from the sentence.
4. Capitalizes the first character of the sentence.
5. Removes all spaces from the sentence.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '(A (b B))', we follow these steps:
- The input is not an empty string, so we proceed.
- We remove all '(' characters, resulting in 'A b B)'.
- We remove all ')' characters, resulting in 'A b B'.
- We capitalize the first character, resulting in 'A b B' (since 'A' is already capitalized).
- We remove all spaces, resulting in 'AbB'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '(A (b B))' is 'AbB'.
<<<Output>>>
'AbB'
