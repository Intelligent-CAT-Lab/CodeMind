<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an array and an element (elem) to find in that array.
The first operation in the function is to reverse the array. The original array [5, -3, 3, 2] becomes [2, 3, -3, 5].
Next, the function tries to find the index of the element (elem) in the reversed array. In this case, elem is 2.
Since 2 is the first element in the reversed array, its index is 0.
The finally block is executed next, which reverses the array back to its original order. The array becomes [5, -3, 3, 2] again.
The function then returns the found index of the element, which is 0.
