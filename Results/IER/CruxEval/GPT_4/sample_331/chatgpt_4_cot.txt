<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, `strand` and `zmnc`. It searches for the substring `zmnc` within the string `strand` and removes the part of `strand` up to and including the first occurrence of `zmnc`. This process repeats in a while loop until `zmnc` is no longer found in `strand`. Finally, the function returns the last index of `zmnc` in the modified `strand`.

Let's analyze the function step by step with the given inputs `strand = ''` and `zmnc = 'abc'`:

1. The variable `poz` is assigned the result of `strand.find(zmnc)`. Since `strand` is an empty string, `find` will return `-1` because `zmnc` cannot be found in an empty string.
2. The while loop checks if `poz` is not equal to `-1`. Since `poz` is `-1`, the loop will not execute.
3. The function then returns `strand.rfind(zmnc)`. Since `strand` is still an empty string, `rfind` will also return `-1` because `zmnc` cannot be found in an empty string.

Therefore, the return value of `f('', 'abc')` will be `-1`.
