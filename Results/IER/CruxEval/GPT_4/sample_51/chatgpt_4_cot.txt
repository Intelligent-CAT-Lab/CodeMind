<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer num as input and checks if it is even or odd.
- If num is even (num % 2 == 0), it returns the string s, which is the '<' character repeated 10 times.
- If num is odd, it returns num subtracted by 1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 21, we need to check if 21 is even or odd.
- Since 21 is odd (21 % 2 == 1), the function will return 21 - 1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 21 is 20.
