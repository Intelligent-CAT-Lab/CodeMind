<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two lists, arr1 and arr2, as input.
1. It creates a copy of arr1 and assigns it to the variable new_arr.
2. It then extends new_arr with the elements of arr2 using the extend() method.
3. Finally, it returns the new_arr.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8]` and `['', 0, -1, []]`, we perform the following steps:
- Copy the first list `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8]` to new_arr.
- Extend new_arr with the second list `['', 0, -1, []]`.
- The resulting list will be `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given inputs is `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]`.
<<<Output>>>
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]
