<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'sentence' as input and iterates over each character in the string.
For each character, it checks if the character is an ASCII character using the isascii() method.
If any character is not an ASCII character, the function immediately returns False.
If all characters are ASCII characters, the function returns True after the loop completes.

In the given input '1z1z1', all characters are ASCII characters:
- '1' is an ASCII character.
- 'z' is an ASCII character.
- '1' is an ASCII character.
- 'z' is an ASCII character.
- '1' is an ASCII character.

Since all characters in the input string '1z1z1' are ASCII characters, the function will not return False during the iteration.
After completing the loop without encountering a non-ASCII character, the function will return True.
<<<Output>>>
True
