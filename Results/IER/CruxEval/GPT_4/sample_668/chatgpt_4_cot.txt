<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string that is formed by taking the last character of text and concatenating it with the substring of text that excludes the last character.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'hellomyfriendear', we need to perform the following steps:
1. Identify the last character of the input string, which is 'r'.
2. Create a substring of the input string that excludes the last character, which is 'hellomyfriendea'.
3. Concatenate the last character 'r' with the substring 'hellomyfriendea'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'hellomyfriendear' is 'rhellomyfriendea'.
<<<Output>>>
'rhellomyfriendea'
