<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary named graph as input and creates a new dictionary named new_graph.
The function then iterates over each key-value pair in the input graph dictionary.
Since the input to the function is an empty dictionary ({}), there are no key-value pairs to iterate over.
Therefore, the new_graph remains an empty dictionary as no modifications are made to it.
The function then returns the new_graph, which is still an empty dictionary.
