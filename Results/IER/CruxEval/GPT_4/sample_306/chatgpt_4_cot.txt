The function f takes a list of elements called nums as input and processes it to return a list of digits.

1. An empty list called digits is initialized.
2. The function iterates over each element in the input list nums.
3. For each element, it checks if the element is either a string that represents a numeric value (using num.isnumeric()) or an integer (using isinstance(num, int)).
4. If the element passes the check, it is appended to the digits list.
5. After the loop, the digits list contains all the numeric elements from the input list, both integers and numeric strings.
6. The map function is then used to convert all elements in the digits list to integers, in case there are any strings.
7. The map object is converted back to a list and returned.

For the input [0, 6, '1', '2', 0]:
- 0 is an integer, so it is appended to digits.
- 6 is an integer, so it is appended to digits.
- '1' is a string that represents a numeric value, so it is appended to digits.
- '2' is a string that represents a numeric value, so it is appended to digits.
- 0 is an integer, so it is appended to digits.

After the loop, digits = [0, 6, '1', '2', 0].
The map function converts all elements to integers, resulting in digits = [0, 6, 1, 2, 0].
This final list is returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 6, 1, 2, 0]
