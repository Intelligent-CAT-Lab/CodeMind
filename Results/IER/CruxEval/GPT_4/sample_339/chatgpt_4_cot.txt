<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an array and an element elem. It then converts elem to a string and initializes a counter d to 0. The function iterates over each item in the array, converts it to a string, and checks if it is equal to the string representation of elem. If it is, the counter d is incremented by 1. After iterating through the entire array, the function returns the value of d, which represents the number of times elem appears in the array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `([-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2], 2)`, we need to count how many times the number 2 appears in the array `[-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2]`.

- The first element -1 is not equal to 2, so d remains 0.
- The second element 2 is equal to 2, so d is incremented to 1.
- The third element 1 is not equal to 2, so d remains 1.
- The fourth element -8 is not equal to 2, so d remains 1.
- The fifth element -8 is not equal to 2, so d remains 1.
- The sixth element 2 is equal to 2, so d is incremented to 2.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `([-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2], 2)` is 2, as the number 2 appears twice in the array.
