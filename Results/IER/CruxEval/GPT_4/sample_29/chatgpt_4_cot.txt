<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string `text` as input and performs the following steps:

1. It creates a list `nums` by filtering out all characters from `text` that are not numeric using the `filter` function with `str.isnumeric` as the filter criterion.
2. It then asserts that the length of `nums` is greater than 0, which means there must be at least one numeric character in the input `text`.
3. Finally, it returns the concatenation of all numeric characters in `nums` as a single string using `''.join(nums)`.

For the input '-123   \t+314', the following happens:

- The filter function will iterate over each character in the string and check if it is numeric.
- The characters '-', ' ', '\t', and '+' are not numeric and will be ignored.
- The characters '1', '2', '3', '3', '1', '4' are numeric and will be included in the `nums` list.
- The `assert` statement will pass since there are numeric characters in the list.
- The `join` function will concatenate the numeric characters into a single string '123314'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '-123   \t+314' is '123314'.

'123314'
