<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a string `text`, an integer `limit`, and a character `char`.
It checks if the `limit` is less than the length of `text`. If it is, the function returns a substring of `text` from the beginning to the `limit` index.
If the `limit` is not less than the length of `text`, the function returns `text` left-justified in a string of length `limit`, padded with `char`.

For the input `f('tqzym', 5, 'c')`, the `limit` is equal to the length of `text` (which is 5). Therefore, the condition `limit < len(text)` is False.
Since the condition is False, the function will execute the second return statement, which is `text.ljust(limit, char)`.
The `ljust` method will attempt to left-justify `text` in a string of length `limit` (which is 5), but since `text` is already 5 characters long, no padding with `char` is needed.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `('tqzym', 5, 'c')` is the original `text` without any changes.

'tqzym'
