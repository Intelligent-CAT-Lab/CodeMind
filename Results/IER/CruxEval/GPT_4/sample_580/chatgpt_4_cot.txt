<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a string `text` and a character `char`. It initializes an empty list `a` and a variable `new_text` with the value of `text`. Then it enters a while loop that continues as long as `char` is in `new_text`.

Inside the loop, the function appends the index of `char` in `new_text` to the list `a`. Then it replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `new_text` with an empty string, effectively removing it.

For the input `f('rvr', 'r')`, the following steps occur:
1. `new_text` is initialized to 'rvr'.
2. The while loop checks if 'r' is in `new_text`, which is true.
3. The index of 'r' in `new_text` is 0, so 0 is appended to the list `a`.
4. The first 'r' is removed from `new_text`, resulting in `new_text` now being 'vr'.
5. The while loop checks if 'r' is in `new_text`, which is true.
6. The index of 'r' in `new_text` is now 1 (since 'vr' has 'r' at index 1), so 1 is appended to the list `a`.
7. The 'r' is removed from `new_text`, resulting in `new_text` now being 'v'.
8. The while loop checks if 'r' is in `new_text`, which is false.
9. The loop ends, and the function returns the list `a`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('rvr', 'r') is a list containing the indices where 'r' appeared in the original `text`, which are [0, 1].
