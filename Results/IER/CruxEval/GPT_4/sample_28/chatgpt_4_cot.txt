<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list mylist as input and performs the following operations:

1. It creates a copy of the input list mylist and assigns it to the variable revl.
2. It reverses the order of the elements in the list revl using the reverse() method.
3. It sorts the original list mylist in descending order (reverse=True) using the sort() method.
4. It compares whether the sorted mylist is equal to the reversed list revl and returns the result of this comparison.

Now, let's apply these steps to the input [5, 8]:

1. revl is assigned a copy of [5, 8], so revl is now [5, 8].
2. revl is reversed, so revl becomes [8, 5].
3. mylist is sorted in descending order, so mylist becomes [8, 5].
4. The function compares mylist and revl, which are both [8, 5].

Since mylist and revl are equal after these operations, the function will return True.
