<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an array and an element (elem).
The function returns the result of the count of elem in the array plus the elem itself.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [1, 1, 1] and elem -2, we need to perform the following steps:
1. Count the occurrences of elem (-2) in the array [1, 1, 1]. Since -2 is not present in the array, the count is 0.
2. Add the count (0) to the elem (-2).

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input is 0 + (-2) = -2.
<<<Output>>>
-2
