<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string `row` as input and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the count of '1's in the string, and the second element is the count of '0's in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "100010010", we need to count the number of '1's and '0's in the string.
The string "100010010" contains three '1's and six '0's.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "100010010" is a tuple with the first element being 3 (the count of '1's) and the second element being 6 (the count of '0's).
<<<Output>>>
(3, 6)
