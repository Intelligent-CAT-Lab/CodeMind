<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string `code` as input and returns a formatted string that includes the original code and its encoded version.
The `format` method is used to insert the `code` and `code.encode()` into the string "{}: {}".
The `code.encode()` method encodes the string into its default encoding, which is UTF-8. This will convert the string '148' into a bytes object.
The bytes object representation of the string '148' in UTF-8 encoding is b'148'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '148' is the string "148: b'148'".
<<<Output>>>
'148: b\'148\''
