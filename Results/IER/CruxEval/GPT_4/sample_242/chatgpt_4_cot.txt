<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string `book` as input and performs the following steps:

1. It splits the input string `book` at the last occurrence of the colon ':' using `rsplit(':', 1)`, which results in a list `a` with two elements: the part before the last colon and the part after the last colon.

2. It then checks if the last word of the first part (before the colon) is the same as the first word of the second part (after the colon). This is done by splitting each part on spaces and comparing the last word of the first split (`a[0].split(' ')[-1]`) with the first word of the second split (`a[1].split(' ')[0]`).

3. If the words match, it calls the function f recursively, joining the first part without the last word and the second part without the first word with a space in between.

4. If the words do not match, it returns the `book` string as it is.

Let's apply these steps to the input `"udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun"`:

- The input is split into `["udhv zcvi nhtnfyd", "erwuyawa pun"]`.
- The last word of the first part is `"nhtnfyd"` and the first word of the second part is `"erwuyawa"`. These do not match, so the function will return the input string as it is.

Therefore, the return value of `f("udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun")` will be `"udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun"`.
<<<Output>>>
'udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun'
