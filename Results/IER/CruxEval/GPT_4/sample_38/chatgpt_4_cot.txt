<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and performs two operations on it:
1. It converts the first character of each word to uppercase and the rest of the characters to lowercase using the title() method.
2. It removes all spaces from the string using the replace() method with ' ' as the target substring to be replaced with an empty string ''.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '1oE-err bzz-bmm', we need to follow these steps:
- The title() method will convert the input string to '1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm'. Here, '1Oe-', 'Err', 'Bzz-', and 'Bmm' are considered separate words, and the first character of each word is capitalized.
- The replace() method will then remove all spaces from the string, resulting in '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '1oE-err bzz-bmm' is '1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'.
<<<Output>>>
'1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm'
