<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input and initializes an empty list called result. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as the dictionary has more than 0 keys.

The loop uses the popitem() method to remove a key-value pair from the dictionary d and append it to the result list as a tuple. The popitem() method removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair in Python versions 3.7 and later. In earlier versions, popitem() removes and returns a random item.

Since the input dictionary is `{5: 1, 'abc': 2, 'defghi': 2, 87.29: 3}`, and assuming we are using Python 3.7 or later, the popitem() method will remove the items in reverse order of their insertion. Therefore, the last inserted item `87.29: 3` will be removed first, followed by `'defghi': 2`, `'abc': 2`, and `5: 1`.

The while loop will terminate when there are no more keys in the dictionary, and the function will return the result list, which contains all the removed key-value pairs as tuples.

The order of the tuples in the result list will be the reverse of the insertion order of the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

Therefore, the expected output will be a list of tuples with the key-value pairs in reverse order of their insertion: `[(87.29, 3), ('defghi', 2), ('abc', 2), (5, 1)]`.
