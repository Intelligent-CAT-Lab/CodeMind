<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `text` and a character `char`.
Initially, it sets the variable `position` to the length of `text`, which is 9 in this case (since 'wduhzxlfk' has 9 characters).

The function then checks if `char` is in `text`. Since 'w' is the first character of 'wduhzxlfk', the condition is true.

Next, it sets `position` to the index of `char` in `text`. The index of 'w' in 'wduhzxlfk' is 0.

Then, it checks if `position` is greater than 1. Since the current value of `position` is 0, this condition is false.

Since the condition is false, the function skips the if block and proceeds to return `position`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('wduhzxlfk', 'w') is 0.
