<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list called array as input and performs the following operations:

1. `array.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list. After this operation, the list becomes `[0, -2, 3]`.

2. `array.clear()` removes all the elements from the list, leaving it empty.

3. `array.extend('x'*len(array))` extends the list by adding elements from the iterable provided as an argument. However, since the list is now empty, `len(array)` is `0`, and `'x'*0` is an empty string. Therefore, this operation does not add any elements to the list.

4. `array.reverse()` is called again, but since the list is still empty, this operation has no effect.

The final result is an empty list because all elements were cleared and no new elements were added after the clear operation.
