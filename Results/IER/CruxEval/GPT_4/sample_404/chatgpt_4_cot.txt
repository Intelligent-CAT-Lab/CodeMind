The function f takes a list of characters as input and performs the following steps:

1. It creates a dictionary `d` using `dict.fromkeys(no, False)`. This will create a dictionary where each character in the input list `no` becomes a key, and the value for each key is set to `False`. Since dictionary keys are unique, any duplicate characters in the input list will be collapsed into a single key. For the input `['l', 'f', 'h', 'g', 's', 'b']`, the dictionary will have each character as a key with the value `False`, and no duplicates, so the dictionary will look like this:
   {'l': False, 'f': False, 'h': False, 'g': False, 's': False, 'b': False}

2. It then creates a list comprehension `[1 for i in d.keys()]` which iterates over the keys of the dictionary `d` and for each key, it includes the integer `1` in the new list. Since there are no conditions in the list comprehension, it will include a `1` for each key in the dictionary.

3. The function then returns the sum of the list created by the list comprehension. Since the list contains a `1` for each key in the dictionary, the sum will be equal to the number of keys in the dictionary.

For the input `['l', 'f', 'h', 'g', 's', 'b']`, the dictionary will have 6 keys (one for each unique character in the list), so the list comprehension will produce a list of six `1`s: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

4. The sum of this list is `6`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `['l', 'f', 'h', 'g', 's', 'b']` is `6`.
