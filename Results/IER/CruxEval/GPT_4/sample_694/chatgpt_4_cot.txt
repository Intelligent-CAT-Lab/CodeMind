The function f takes a dictionary d as input and performs the following steps:
1. It calculates the length of the dictionary minus one and stores it in the variable i.
2. It retrieves the key at index i from the list of keys of the dictionary and stores it in the variable key.
3. It removes the key-value pair from the dictionary where the key is the value stored in the variable key.
4. It returns a tuple containing the key and the modified dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `dict(e=1, d=2, c=3)`, we need to follow these steps:
1. The length of the dictionary is 3, so i will be 3 - 1, which is 2.
2. The keys of the dictionary are ['e', 'd', 'c'] (assuming the dictionary maintains the insertion order as per Python 3.7+). The key at index 2 is 'c'.
3. The key 'c' and its associated value 3 are removed from the dictionary.
4. The function returns a tuple containing the key 'c' and the modified dictionary, which now only contains the key-value pairs 'e': 1 and 'd': 2.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `dict(e=1, d=2, c=3)` is ('c', {'e': 1, 'd': 2}).
<<<Output>>>
('c', {'e': 1, 'd': 2})
