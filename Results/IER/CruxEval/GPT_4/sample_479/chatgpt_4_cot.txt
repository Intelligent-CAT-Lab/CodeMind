<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a list called nums, and two integers pop1 and pop2. It performs two pop operations on the list nums. The pop method removes an element from the list at the specified index.

1. The first pop operation is `nums.pop(pop1 - 1)`. Since pop1 is 2, it will remove the element at index 1 (since list indices are 0-based). The list nums initially is [1, 5, 2, 3, 6], so after this operation, the element 5 (which is at index 1) will be removed. The list now becomes [1, 2, 3, 6].

2. The second pop operation is `nums.pop(pop2 - 1)`. Since pop2 is 4, it will remove the element at index 3 (since we've already removed one element and the indices have shifted). The modified list after the first pop is [1, 2, 3, 6], so after this operation, the element 3 (which is now at index 3) will be removed. The list now becomes [1, 2, 6].

The function then returns the modified list.

[1, 2, 6]
