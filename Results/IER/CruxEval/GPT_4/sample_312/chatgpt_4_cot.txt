<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string str as input and checks if the string is alphanumeric using the str.isalnum() method.
The str.isalnum() method returns True if all characters in the string are alphanumeric (either alphabets or numbers) and there is at least one character, otherwise it returns False.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '777', we need to check if '777' is alphanumeric.
Since '777' consists only of numeric characters and is non-empty, it is considered alphanumeric.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '777' is "True" because the condition str.isalnum() evaluates to True.
<<<Output>>>
'True'
