<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of numbers `nums` and an integer `p`.
The variable `prev_p` is assigned the value of `p - 1`, which is `6 - 1 = 5`.
The function then checks if `prev_p` is less than 0. If it is, it sets `prev_p` to `len(nums) - 1`. In this case, `prev_p` is not less than 0, so this condition is not executed.
The function returns the value at the index `prev_p` of the list `nums`. Since `prev_p` is 5, it will return the value at index 5 of the list `nums`.
The list `nums` is `[6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7]`, and the value at index 5 is `1`.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input will be `1`.
