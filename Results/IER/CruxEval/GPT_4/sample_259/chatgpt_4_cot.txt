<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and processes it to generate a new string that contains only the uppercase letters from the input text, inserted into a new list in a specific order. The order is determined by inserting each uppercase letter at the index that is half the current length of the new list (rounded down). If no uppercase letters are found, the new list will contain a single character '-'.

Let's process the input 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.' step by step:

1. The new_text list is initialized as an empty list.
2. The function iterates over each character in the input text.
3. The first uppercase character 'S' is found and inserted at index 0 (len(new_text) // 2 = 0 // 2 = 0).
4. The next uppercase character 'R' is found and inserted at index 1 (len(new_text) // 2 = 1 // 2 = 0).
5. The next uppercase character 'E' is found and inserted at index 1 (len(new_text) // 2 = 2 // 2 = 1).
6. No more uppercase characters are found in the rest of the text.
7. The new_text list now contains ['S', 'E', 'R'].
8. The list is joined into a string using ''.join(new_text), resulting in 'SER'.

Since there are uppercase letters in the input text, the condition len(new_text) == 0 is not met, and the new_text list is not replaced with ['-'].

Therefore, the output of the function f on the given input is 'SER'.
