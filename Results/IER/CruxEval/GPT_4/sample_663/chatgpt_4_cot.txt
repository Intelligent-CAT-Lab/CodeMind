<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a container (which is expected to be a list) and a value cron.

1. The function first checks if cron is not in the container. If cron is not found, the function will return the container as it is.
2. In this case, the container is an empty list `[]`, and cron is the value `2`.
3. Since the empty list does not contain any elements, including the value `2`, the condition `not cron in container` is True.
4. Therefore, the function will return the container without any modifications.

The output of executing the function f on the input `([], 2)` is an empty list `[]`.
