<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings (items) as input and returns a list of characters (result) that are not digits from each string in the input list.

1. The function initializes an empty list called result.
2. It then iterates over each string in the input list items.
3. For each string (item), it iterates over each character (d) in the string.
4. If the character d is not a digit (checked using the isdigit() method), it appends the character to the result list.

Let's apply these steps to the input `['123', 'cat', 'd dee']`:

- For the first item '123':
  - All characters are digits, so nothing is appended to the result list.
- For the second item 'cat':
  - 'c' is not a digit, so it is appended to the result list.
  - 'a' is not a digit, so it is appended to the result list.
  - 't' is not a digit, so it is appended to the result list.
- For the third item 'd dee':
  - 'd' is not a digit, so it is appended to the result list.
  - ' ' (space) is not a digit, so it is appended to the result list.
  - 'd' is not a digit, so it is appended to the result list.
  - 'e' is not a digit, so it is appended to the result list.
  - 'e' is not a digit, so it is appended to the result list.

After processing all items, the result list will contain ['c', 'a', 't', 'd', ' ', 'd', 'e', 'e'].
<<<Output>>>
['c', 'a', 't', 'd', ' ', 'd', 'e', 'e']
