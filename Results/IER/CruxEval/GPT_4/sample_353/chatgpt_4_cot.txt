The function f takes a list x as input and performs the following steps:
1. If the list x is empty, it returns -1.
2. If the list is not empty, it initializes an empty dictionary called cache.
3. It then iterates over each item in the list x.
4. For each item, it checks if the item is already a key in the cache dictionary.
5. If the item is already a key, it increments the value associated with that key by 1.
6. If the item is not a key in the cache, it adds the item as a key to the cache with the value 1.
7. After iterating through all items, it returns the maximum value among all the values in the cache dictionary.

Now, let's apply these steps to the input [1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]:
- The list is not empty, so we proceed to create the cache dictionary.
- We iterate over each item in the list and update the cache dictionary as follows:
  - cache = {1: 1} after seeing the first item.
  - cache = {1: 1, 0: 1} after seeing the second item.
  - cache = {1: 1, 0: 1, 2: 1} after seeing the third item.
  - cache = {1: 1, 0: 1, 2: 2} after seeing the fourth item (incrementing the count for 2).
  - cache = {1: 1, 0: 2, 2: 2} after seeing the fifth item (incrementing the count for 0).
  - cache = {1: 1, 0: 3, 2: 2} after seeing the sixth item (incrementing the count for 0).
  - cache = {1: 1, 0: 4, 2: 2} after seeing the seventh item (incrementing the count for 0).
  - cache = {1: 2, 0: 4, 2: 2} after seeing the eighth item (incrementing the count for 1).
- The maximum value in the cache dictionary is 4 (for the key 0).

Therefore, the function will return the maximum value in the cache, which is 4.
