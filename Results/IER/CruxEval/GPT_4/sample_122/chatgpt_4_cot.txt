<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and checks if the first four characters of the string are 'Nuva'.
If the first four characters are not 'Nuva', it returns 'no'.
If the first four characters are 'Nuva', it returns the string after stripping any trailing whitespace using the rstrip() method.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'Nuva?dlfuyjys', we need to check the following:
1. The first four characters of 'Nuva?dlfuyjys' are 'Nuva', so the condition string[:4] != 'Nuva' is False.
2. Since the condition is False, the else block is executed.
3. The rstrip() method is called on the string 'Nuva?dlfuyjys', but since there are no trailing whitespaces, the string remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'Nuva?dlfuyjys' is 'Nuva?dlfuyjys'.
<<<Output>>>
'Nuva?dlfuyjys'
