<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns True if the number of '-' characters in the string is equal to the length of the string, otherwise it returns False.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "---123-4", we need to count the number of '-' characters and compare it to the length of the string.

The input string "---123-4" has 4 '-' characters.
The length of the input string "---123-4" is 8 characters.
Since the number of '-' characters (4) is not equal to the length of the string (8), the function will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
