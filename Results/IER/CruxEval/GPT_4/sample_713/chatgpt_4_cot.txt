<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `text` and a character `char`. It checks if `char` is in `text`, and if so, it splits `text` by `char`, strips whitespace from each resulting substring, and filters out any empty strings. If the resulting list has more than one element, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Let's analyze the function step by step with the given input `f('only one line', ' ')`:

1. The character ' ' (space) is checked against the string 'only one line'. Since there are spaces in the string, the condition `if char in text:` is True.

2. The string 'only one line' is split by the space character ' ', resulting in the list ['only', 'one', 'line'].

3. Each element in the list is stripped of whitespace, but since there are no leading or trailing whitespaces in any of the elements, the list remains the same.

4. The list is filtered to remove any empty strings. Since there are no empty strings, the list remains ['only', 'one', 'line'].

5. The length of the list is checked. Since the list has 3 elements, and 3 is greater than 1, the condition `if len(text) > 1:` is True.

6. The function returns True because the list has more than one element.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('only one line', ' ') is True.
