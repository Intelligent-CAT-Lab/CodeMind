<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a list `nums`, an integer `idx`, and an integer `added`.
The function inserts the integer `added` into the list `nums` at the position specified by `idx` without replacing any existing elements (it does this by using slice assignment with an empty slice `nums[idx:idx]` and a tuple containing the `added` element).

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `([2, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, 3)`, we need to insert the value `3` at index `2` of the list `[2, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.

The original list is `[2, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.
After the insertion, the list becomes `[2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]` because the element `3` is inserted before the element at index `2` without removing any elements.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `([2, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, 3)` is `[2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`.

[2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]
