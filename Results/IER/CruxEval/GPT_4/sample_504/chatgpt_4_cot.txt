<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of values as input and sorts the list in place using the sort() method.
The input list is [1, 1, 1, 1].
Since all elements in the list are the same, sorting the list will not change its order.
After calling the sort() method on the list, the list remains [1, 1, 1, 1].
The function then returns the sorted list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1, 1] is the same list [1, 1, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 1]
