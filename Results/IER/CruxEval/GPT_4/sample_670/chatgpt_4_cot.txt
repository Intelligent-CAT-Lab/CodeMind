<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two lists as input: a and b. It performs the following steps:

1. It creates a dictionary d by zipping together the elements of a and b. This means that it pairs each element of a with the corresponding element of b. In this case, the dictionary will be {'12': 2, 'ab': 2}.

2. It sorts the list a based on the values associated with its elements in the dictionary d. Since both '12' and 'ab' have the same value 2 in the dictionary, the sort operation will not change the order of the list a. The reverse=True argument means that if there were different values, it would sort them in descending order, but in this case, it has no effect.

3. It returns a new list that is created by popping the values from the dictionary d for each element in the sorted list a. Since the dictionary contains the same value for both keys, and the order of a has not changed, the new list will contain the values [2, 2], which are the values associated with '12' and 'ab' in the dictionary.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (['12','ab'], [2,2]) is [2, 2].
