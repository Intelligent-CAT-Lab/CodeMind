<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a string `text` and a string `suffix`. It checks if `text` ends with the `suffix` using the `endswith` method. If `text` does end with `suffix`, it returns a new string with the `suffix` removed. This is done by slicing the `text` from the beginning to the negative length of the `suffix`. If `text` does not end with `suffix`, it simply returns the original `text`.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'zejrohaj' and 'owc', we need to check if 'zejrohaj' ends with 'owc'. Since it does not, the condition in the if statement evaluates to False, and the function will return the original `text` without any changes.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'zejrohaj' and 'owc' is 'zejrohaj'.
<<<Output>>>
'zejrohaj'
