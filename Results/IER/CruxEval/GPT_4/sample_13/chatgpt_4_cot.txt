<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings called names as input and initializes two variables: count, which is set to the length of the names list, and numberOfNames, which is initialized to 0.

The function then iterates over each element in the names list with a for loop. For each element i, it checks if the string is composed entirely of alphabetic characters using the isalpha() method.

If i.isalpha() returns True, it means the string contains only alphabetic characters, and the function increments numberOfNames by 1.

The input provided is a list with three elements: ['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee'].

- 'sharron' is composed entirely of alphabetic characters, so numberOfNames is incremented by 1.
- 'Savannah' is also composed entirely of alphabetic characters, so numberOfNames is incremented by 1 again.
- 'Mike Cherokee' contains a space, which is not an alphabetic character, so numberOfNames is not incremented for this string.

After the loop, numberOfNames is equal to the number of strings in the list that are composed entirely of alphabetic characters.

In this case, there are 2 such strings ('sharron' and 'Savannah'), so the function will return 2.
