<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary dct as input and initializes an empty list lst.
It then iterates over the keys of the dictionary in sorted order. The sorted() function sorts the keys of the dictionary in ascending order.
For each key in the sorted keys, it appends a tuple to lst. The tuple contains the key and the corresponding value from the dictionary dct.
The input dictionary is {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}.
The keys 'a', 'b', and 'c' are already in sorted order, so the sorted() function does not change their order.
The function appends ('a', 1), ('b', 2), and ('c', 3) to the list lst in that order.
Finally, the function returns the list lst, which now contains the tuples with the sorted keys and their corresponding values.
<<<Output>>>
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
