<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and checks if the string is empty or if the first character of the string is not numeric. If either condition is true, it returns 'INVALID'.

For the input '3':
1. The string is not empty, and the first character '3' is numeric (although there is a mistake in the code where `isnumeric` should be called as a method `isnumeric()`; it is not called correctly, but for the purpose of this analysis, we will assume it is intended to be called correctly).
2. The variable cur is initialized to 0.
3. The for loop iterates over the length of the string, which is 1 in this case.
4. Inside the loop, cur is updated to be cur * 10 + int(string[i]). Since cur is initially 0, the expression becomes 0 * 10 + int('3'), which evaluates to 3.
5. After the loop, the integer value of cur is converted back to a string and returned.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '3' is the string representation of the integer 3.
