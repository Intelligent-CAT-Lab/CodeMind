<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of strings called 'strings' and a string called 'substr'. It returns a sorted list of strings from the 'strings' list that start with the 'substr' string. The sorting is based on the length of the strings, from shortest to longest.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `(['condor', 'eyes', 'gay', 'isa'], 'd')`, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Filter the list of strings to include only those that start with the substring 'd'. In the provided list, only the string "condor" starts with 'd'.
2. Sort the resulting list by the length of its elements. Since there is only one string "condor" after filtering, the sorting step will not change the list.
3. Return the sorted list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input will be a list containing the single string "condor".
