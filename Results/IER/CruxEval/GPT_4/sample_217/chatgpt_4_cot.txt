<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and checks if the string is alphanumeric (consisting of only letters and numbers) using the `isalnum()` method.
The input string 'Str zahrnuje anglo-ameriæske vasi piscina and kuca!' contains spaces, special characters like '-', and an extended ASCII character 'æ', which are not considered alphanumeric characters.
Since the input string contains characters other than letters and numbers, the `isalnum()` method will return False.
Therefore, the function will return the string "more than ASCII" because the input string contains characters that are not limited to ASCII alphanumeric characters.
<<<Output>>>
'more than ASCII'
