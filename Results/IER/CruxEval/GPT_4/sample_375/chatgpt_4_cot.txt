<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a string `a` and a substring `b`. It checks if the substring `b` is in the string `a`. If it is, the function returns the result of `b.join(a.partition(a[a.index(b) + 1]))`. Otherwise, it returns the original string `a`.

Let's break down the steps for the input `f('sierizam', 'iz')`:

1. Check if 'iz' is in 'sierizam'. It is, so we proceed with the if block.
2. Find the index of 'iz' in 'sierizam', which is 3.
3. Get the character immediately after 'iz' in 'sierizam', which is at index 3 + 1 = 4. The character at index 4 is 'a'.
4. Partition the string 'sierizam' around the character 'a'. This results in a tuple with three elements: the part before 'a', the 'a' itself, and the part after 'a'. In this case, the tuple is ('sier', 'a', 'm').
5. Join this tuple with 'iz' as the separator. This means 'iz' will be placed between each element of the tuple. The result will be 'sier' + 'iz' + 'a' + 'iz' + 'm'.

Now, let's put it all together to get the final output.

'sierizaizm'
