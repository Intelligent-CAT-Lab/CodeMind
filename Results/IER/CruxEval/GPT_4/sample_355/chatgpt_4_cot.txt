<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a string `text` and a string `prefix`. It returns a substring of `text` starting from the index that is the length of `prefix`.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs '123x John z' and 'z', we need to follow these steps:
1. Calculate the length of the prefix 'z', which is 1.
2. Use this length as the starting index to slice the text '123x John z'.
3. Since the length is 1, we start the slice from index 1 of '123x John z'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs '123x John z' and 'z' is '23x John z' (the substring of '123x John z' starting from index 1).
<<<Output>>>
'23x John z'
