<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following steps:
1. It strips any leading and trailing whitespace from the input string and then splits the string into a list of words based on spaces using the split(' ') method. The input "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41" becomes ['d', 'khqw', 'whi', 'fwi', 'bbn', '41'].
2. It then iterates over each word in the list using a for loop with a range based on the length of the list.
3. Inside the loop, it checks if the current word is a digit using the isdigit() method. If any word is not a digit (i.e., isdigit() returns False), the function immediately returns '-'.
4. If all words are digits (which is not the case here), it would join the list of words back into a string with spaces in between using " ".join(a) and return that string.

In this case, the first word 'd' is not a digit, so the function will return '-' without checking the rest of the words.
