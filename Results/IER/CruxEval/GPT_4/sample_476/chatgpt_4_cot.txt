<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string 'a' and a character 'split_on'. It performs the following steps:

1. It splits the string 'a' into a list of words using the split() method, which by default splits on whitespace. The result is the list t = ['booty', 'boot-boot', 'bootclass'].

2. It initializes an empty list 'a'.

3. It iterates over each word in the list t, and then iterates over each character in the word, appending each character to the new list 'a'.

4. After the nested loops, the list 'a' contains all the individual characters from the original string 'a'.

5. It checks if the character 'split_on', which is 'k' in this case, is present in the list 'a'.

6. If 'k' is found in the list 'a', the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

7. In this case, 'k' is not present in any of the words 'booty', 'boot-boot', or 'bootclass', so the function will return False.

<<<Output>>>
False
