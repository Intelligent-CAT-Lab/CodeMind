<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of strings called 'values' and a single value called 'value'.
1. It calculates the length of the 'values' list, but this length is not used anywhere in the function.
2. It creates a new dictionary called 'new_dict' using dict.fromkeys(), with keys from the 'values' list and the same value 'value' for all keys.
3. It then creates a new key in 'new_dict' which is the concatenation of the sorted 'values' list and assigns to this key the value 'value' multiplied by 3.
4. The function returns the 'new_dict' dictionary.

For the input `f(['0','3'], 117)`, the following steps will occur:
- The 'values' list is ['0', '3'].
- The 'value' is 117.
- The 'new_dict' will initially be {'0': 117, '3': 117}.
- The sorted 'values' list is ['0', '3'], which when joined becomes '03'.
- The new key '03' is added to the dictionary with the value 117 * 3, which is 351.
- The final dictionary is {'0': 117, '3': 117, '03': 351}.

<<<Output>>>
{'0': 117, '3': 117, '03': 351}
