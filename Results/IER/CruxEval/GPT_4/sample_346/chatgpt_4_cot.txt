<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string filename as input and performs the following steps:
1. It splits the filename by the '.' character and takes the last element of the resulting list, which is the file extension. In this case, the filename is 'docs.doc', so the file extension is 'doc'.
2. It then creates a new string f2 by concatenating the original filename with the reverse of the file extension. The reverse of 'doc' is 'cod', so f2 becomes 'docs.doccod'.
3. Finally, it checks if the new string f2 ends with the original file extension using the endswith() method. Since 'docs.doccod' does not end with 'doc', the function will return False.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'docs.doc' is False.
