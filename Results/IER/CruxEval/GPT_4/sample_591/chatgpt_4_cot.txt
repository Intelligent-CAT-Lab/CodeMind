The function f takes a list of integers arr as input and performs the following steps:

1. It initializes a list counts with 9 zeros. This list is used to count the occurrences of each number from 1 to 9 in the input list arr.

2. It initializes an empty list ans which will store the sorted elements of arr.

3. The function then iterates over each element ele in arr and increments the corresponding index in counts by 1. The index is determined by ele - 1 because list indices in Python are 0-based.

4. After counting the occurrences, the function iterates over the range of the length of counts (which is 9). For each index i, it appends i + 1 to the list ans as many times as the count at counts[i].

5. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the counts list and the ans list.

Let's apply these steps to the input [6, 3, 0, 7, 4, 8]:

- counts will be initialized as [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
- The loop will update counts to [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] (since there is a 0 in the input, which is not within the range 1-9, it will not be counted).
- The second loop will create ans by appending numbers based on their counts. The final ans will be [3, 4, 6, 7, 8] (0 is not included as it is not within the range 1-9).

Note that the input contains a 0, which is not within the range 1-9, so it will not be counted or included in the ans list.

The final counts list will be all zeros [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] because the counts are decremented to 0 as the numbers are appended to ans.

The function will return the tuple ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 4, 6, 7, 8]).
