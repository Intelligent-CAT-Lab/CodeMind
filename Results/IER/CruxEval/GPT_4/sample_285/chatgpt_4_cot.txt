<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `text` and a character `ch`. It returns the number of times the character `ch` appears in the string `text`.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `"This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!"` with the character `' '`, we need to count how many times the space character appears in the given string.
The string `"This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!"` contains 6 space characters.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
