<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, text and suffix. It checks if both arguments are not empty and if the text ends with the given suffix.
In this case, the input text is 'spider' and the suffix is 'ed'.
The function first checks if suffix ('ed') is not empty, which is true.
Then it checks if text ('spider') is not empty, which is also true.
After that, it checks if text ('spider') ends with the suffix ('ed'), which is false because 'spider' ends with 'er', not 'ed'.
Since the condition is not met, the function goes to the else block and returns the original text without any modification.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'spider' and 'ed' is 'spider'.
<<<Output>>>
'spider'
