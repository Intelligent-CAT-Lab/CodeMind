<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string `postcode` as input and returns a substring of `postcode` starting from the index where the character 'C' is found.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ED20 CW', we need to find the index of the character 'C' in the string 'ED20 CW'. The character 'C' is at index 5 (considering the first character has index 0).

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ED20 CW' is the substring of 'ED20 CW' starting from index 5, which is 'CW'.
<<<Output>>>
'CW'
