<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a list called numbers, an element called elem, and an index called idx.
The function inserts the element elem into the list numbers at the position specified by idx.
In this case, the list is [1, 2, 3], the element to insert is 8, and the index at which to insert the element is 5.
Since the list [1, 2, 3] has only three elements, and the index 5 is beyond the current last index of the list, the element 8 will be appended to the end of the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ([1, 2, 3], 8, 5) will be [1, 2, 3, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 8]
