<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an array and an elem. The function extends the array with the elements of elem using the extend() method.

The extend() method takes an iterable as its argument and appends each of its elements to the end of the array.

In this case, the array is `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1]` and elem is `[[1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]`.

When the extend() method is called, it will add each element of elem to the end of the array. The elements of elem are themselves lists and a single integer, so they will be added to the array as individual elements, not as a single list.

Therefore, the resulting array after the extend() operation will be `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]`.

This is the final array that will be returned by the function f.

[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]
