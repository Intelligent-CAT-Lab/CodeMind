<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an array and an element (elem) to find in that array.
The function first finds the index of the element in the array using the index() method.
Then it calculates the return value by multiplying the index by 2 and adding the product of 3 and the element at the position calculated by taking the negative of the index minus 1 from the end of the array.

Let's break down the steps for the input `f([-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2)`:
1. The array is `[-1, 2, 1, -8, 2]` and the element to find is `2`.
2. The index of the first occurrence of `2` in the array is `1`.
3. The calculation for the return value is `ind * 2 + array[-ind - 1] * 3`.
4. Substituting the index value, we get `1 * 2 + array[-1 - 1] * 3`.
5. The element at the position `array[-2]` (second to last element) is `-8`.
6. The calculation now is `1 * 2 + (-8) * 3`.
7. This simplifies to `2 - 24`.
8. The final result is `-22`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `[-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2` is `-22`.
