<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following steps:
1. Converts the input string into a list of characters and stores it in new_text.
2. Iterates over the character '+'.
3. Checks if the character '+' is in the list new_text.
4. If '+' is found in new_text, it removes the first occurrence of '+' from the list.
5. Joins the characters in the list new_text back into a string and returns it.

For the input 'hbtofdeiequ', the following happens:
- The input string does not contain the character '+', so the if condition will never be true.
- Since '+' is not in the list, no characters are removed.
- The original list of characters is joined back into a string, which is the same as the input string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'hbtofdeiequ' is the same as the input string, since there are no '+' characters to remove.
<<<Output>>>
'hbtofdeiequ'
