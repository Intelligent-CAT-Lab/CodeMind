<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the sum of 1 for each character in text if that character is a digit.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "so456", we need to iterate through each character in the string and check if it is a digit.
The string "so456" contains three characters that are digits: '4', '5', and '6'.
For each of these digit characters, the generator expression inside the sum function will yield a 1.
Therefore, the sum of these values will be 3, as there are three digit characters in the string.
<<<Output>>>
3
