<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `text` and an integer `position`. It performs the following steps:

1. It calculates the length of the input string `text` and stores it in the variable `length`.
2. It calculates the index by taking the modulo of `position` with `length + 1`. This ensures that the index is within the range of the string's indices, including the possibility of being just after the last character (which would effectively mean no character is removed).
3. It checks if `position` is negative or if the calculated `index` is negative. If either is true, it sets `index` to -1.
4. It converts the string `text` into a list of characters called `new_text`.
5. It removes the character at the calculated `index` from `new_text` using the `pop` method.
6. It joins the characters in `new_text` back into a string and returns it.

For the input `f('undbs l', 1)`:
- `length` of the string 'undbs l' is 7.
- `index` is calculated as 1 % (7 + 1) = 1 % 8 = 1.
- Since `position` is not negative and `index` is not negative, the condition for setting `index` to -1 is not met.
- The character at index 1 of the string 'undbs l' is 'n'.
- The character 'n' is removed from the list `new_text`.
- The remaining characters are joined to form the new string 'udbs l'.

Therefore, the return value of `f('undbs l', 1)` is 'udbs l'.

'udbs l'
