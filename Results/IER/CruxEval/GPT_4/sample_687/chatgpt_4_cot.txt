The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following operations:
1. Converts the string into a list of characters.
2. Removes the character at the middle index of the list (since the length of the list is divided by 2 and the result is used as the index for the pop method).
3. Appends the lowercase version of the original string to the end of the list.
4. Joins the elements of the list into a string, separated by colons.

Let's apply these steps to the input 'Rjug nzufE':
1. The input string is converted to a list of characters: ['R', 'j', 'u', 'g', ' ', 'n', 'z', 'u', 'f', 'E']
2. The length of the list is 10, so len(t) // 2 is 5. The character at index 5 ('n') is removed: ['R', 'j', 'u', 'g', ' ', 'z', 'u', 'f', 'E']
3. The lowercase version of the original string 'rjug nzufe' is appended to the list: ['R', 'j', 'u', 'g', ' ', 'z', 'u', 'f', 'E', 'rjug nzufe']
4. The elements of the list are joined into a string with colons as separators: 'R:j:u:g: :z:u:f:E:rjug nzufe'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'Rjug nzufE' is 'R:j:u:g: :z:u:f:E:rjug nzufe'.
<<<Output>>>
'R:j:u:g: :z:u:f:E:rjug nzufe'
