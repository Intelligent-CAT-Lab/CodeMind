<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string called sentences as input. It then splits this string into a list of substrings using the '.' character as a delimiter. The resulting list is then passed to a list comprehension, which checks if each substring is a decimal number using the .isdecimal() method. The all() function is used to determine if all elements in the list are True (i.e., if all substrings are decimal numbers).

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'not numbers', we need to follow these steps:
1. Split the input string 'not numbers' using '.' as a delimiter. The result is a list containing one element: ['not numbers'].
2. Check if each element in the list is a decimal number. In this case, 'not numbers' is not a decimal number, so the .isdecimal() method will return False.
3. Since not all elements in the list are decimal numbers (in fact, none are), the all() function will return False.
4. The if condition will therefore not be satisfied, and the function will execute the else block.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'not numbers' is 'not oscillating'.
