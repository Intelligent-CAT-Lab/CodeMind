<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns True if all characters in the string are ASCII, False otherwise. ASCII characters are those in the range of 0-127 in the ASCII table.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'wW의IV]HDJjhgK[dGIUlVO@Ess$coZkBqu[Ct', we need to check if all characters in the string are ASCII characters.

The string contains the character '의', which is a Korean character and not part of the ASCII character set. Therefore, not all characters in the string are ASCII characters.

As a result, the output of executing the function f on the given input will be False.
<<<Output>>>
False
