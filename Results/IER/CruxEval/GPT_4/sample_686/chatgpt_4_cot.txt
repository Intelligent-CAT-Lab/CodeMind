<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a dictionary `d` and a list `l`. It creates an empty dictionary `new_d`.

The function then iterates over each element `k` in the list `l`. For each element, it checks if the key `k` exists in the dictionary `d` using the `get` method. If the key exists (i.e., `d.get(k)` is not `None`), it adds the key-value pair to the new dictionary `new_d`.

After iterating through the list, the function returns a copy of the `new_d` dictionary.

In the given input, the dictionary `d` is `{"lorem ipsum": 12, "dolor": 23}` and the list `l` is `["lorem ipsum", "dolor"]`.

Both keys "lorem ipsum" and "dolor" exist in the dictionary `d`, so they will be added to `new_d` with their corresponding values.

Therefore, the output will be a new dictionary with the same key-value pairs as in `d` because all keys in `l` are present in `d`.

{'lorem ipsum': 12, 'dolor': 23}
