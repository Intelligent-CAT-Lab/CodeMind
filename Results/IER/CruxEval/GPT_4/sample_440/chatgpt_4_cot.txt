<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and checks if the string is composed only of decimal characters.
The method text.isdecimal() returns True if all characters in the string are decimal characters, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "abc", we need to check if "abc" is composed only of decimal characters.
Since "abc" contains alphabetic characters and no decimal characters, text.isdecimal() will return False.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "abc" is 'no'.
<<<Output>>>
'no'
