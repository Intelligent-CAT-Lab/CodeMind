<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and performs the following steps:
1. It creates a list text_list where each element is a character from the input string text.
2. It iterates over text_list using a for loop with enumerate to get both the index (i) and the character (char) of each element.
3. Inside the loop, it uses the swapcase() method on each character (char) to swap its case (uppercase to lowercase and vice versa).
4. It assigns the swapped case character back to the corresponding index (i) in text_list.
5. After the loop, it joins all the characters in text_list back into a single string using the join() method.
6. It returns the resulting string.

For the input 'akA?riu':
- 'a' becomes 'A'
- 'k' becomes 'K'
- 'A' becomes 'a'
- '?' remains '?'
- 'r' becomes 'R'
- 'i' becomes 'I'
- 'u' becomes 'U'

The final string after joining all the swapped case characters is 'AKa?RIU'.
<<<Output>>>
'AKa?RIU'
