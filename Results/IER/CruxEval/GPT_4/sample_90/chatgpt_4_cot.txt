The function f takes a list of lists (array) as input and returns a new list of lists where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding inner list in the input array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `[[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]]`, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty list `return_arr`.
2. Iterate over each element `a` in the input array. Each element `a` is itself a list.
3. For each iteration, append a copy of the list `a` to `return_arr`. The `copy()` method creates a shallow copy of the list `a`.
4. After iterating over all elements, return `return_arr`.

The input array has three elements: `[1, 2, 3]`, `[]`, and `[1, 2, 3]`.

- The first element `[1, 2, 3]` is copied and appended to `return_arr`.
- The second element `[]` (an empty list) is copied and appended to `return_arr`.
- The third element `[1, 2, 3]` is copied and appended to `return_arr`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `[[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]]` is a new list of lists `[[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]]`, where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding inner list in the input array.
