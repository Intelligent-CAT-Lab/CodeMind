<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and initializes a variable prev to the first element of the array. It then creates a copy of the array called newArray.

The function then iterates over the array starting from the second element (index 1). For each element, it checks if the current element is different from the previous element (prev). If it is different, it assigns the current element to the same index in newArray. If it is the same as the previous element, it deletes the current element from newArray.

Since the input array is [1, 2, 3], all elements are different from their predecessors. Therefore, no elements will be deleted from newArray.

The loop will perform the following steps:
- i = 1: prev = 1, array[i] = 2, since prev != array[i], newArray[1] = 2.
- i = 2: prev = 2, array[i] = 3, since prev != array[i], newArray[2] = 3.

No elements are deleted, and newArray remains the same as the input array.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3].
