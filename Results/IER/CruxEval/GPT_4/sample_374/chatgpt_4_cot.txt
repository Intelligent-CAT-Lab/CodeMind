<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a sequence `seq` and a string `v`. It initializes an empty list `a`. Then it iterates over each element `i` in the sequence `seq`. For each element, it checks if the element ends with the string `v` using the `endswith` method. If the element does end with `v`, it appends the element doubled (`i*2`) to the list `a`. After iterating through all elements, the function returns the list `a`.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `([ 'oH', 'ee', 'mb', 'deft', 'n', 'zz', 'f', 'abA' ], 'zz')`, we need to check each element of the list to see if it ends with 'zz'.

- 'oH' does not end with 'zz'.
- 'ee' does not end with 'zz'.
- 'mb' does not end with 'zz'.
- 'deft' does not end with 'zz'.
- 'n' does not end with 'zz'.
- 'zz' does end with 'zz', so 'zzzz' (doubled 'zz') is appended to the list `a`.
- 'f' does not end with 'zz'.
- 'abA' does not end with 'zz'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input is a list containing the single element 'zzzz'.
