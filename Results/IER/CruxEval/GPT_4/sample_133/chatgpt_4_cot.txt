<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of numbers `nums` and a list `elements`. The function initializes an empty list `result`. It then iterates over the range of the length of `elements`, which in this case is 3 since `elements` has three items: [9, 0, 3].

During each iteration, the function appends the last element of `nums` to `result` by using the `pop()` method, which removes the last element from `nums` and returns it. The `pop()` method modifies `nums` in place.

Let's go through the iterations:
1. `nums` is initially [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2]. `pop()` removes 2, and `nums` becomes [7, 1, 2, 6, 0].
2. In the second iteration, `pop()` removes 0, and `nums` becomes [7, 1, 2, 6].
3. In the third iteration, `pop()` removes 6, and `nums` becomes [7, 1, 2].

After the loop, the function returns the modified `nums` list, which now contains [7, 1, 2].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `([7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2], [9, 0, 3])` is `[7, 1, 2]`.
