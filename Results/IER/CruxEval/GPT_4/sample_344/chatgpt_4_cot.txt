<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list and an operation (which is a lambda function in this case).

1. A new list called new_list is created as a copy of the input list.
2. The new_list is sorted in place using the sort() method. After sorting, new_list will be [2, 4, 6, 8, 15].
3. The lambda function passed as the operation argument is then called with new_list as its argument. The lambda function is `(lambda x: x.reverse())`, which reverses the list in place.
4. After the lambda function is executed, new_list will be [15, 8, 6, 4, 2].
5. The original list (the first argument of the function f) is returned. It is important to note that the original list has not been modified by any of the operations performed on new_list.

Therefore, the return value of `f([6, 4, 2, 8, 15], (lambda x: x.reverse()))` will be the original list `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
