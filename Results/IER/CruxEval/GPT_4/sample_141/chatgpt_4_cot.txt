<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list li as input and returns a new list that contains the count of each element in li as they appear in the list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `['k', 'x', 'c', 'x', 'x', 'b', 'l', 'f', 'r', 'n', 'g']`, we need to count the occurrences of each element in the list and create a new list with these counts.

- 'k' appears 1 time in the list.
- 'x' appears 3 times in the list.
- 'c' appears 1 time in the list.
- 'x' appears 3 times in the list (same as the second element).
- 'x' appears 3 times in the list (same as the second and fourth elements).
- 'b' appears 1 time in the list.
- 'l' appears 1 time in the list.
- 'f' appears 1 time in the list.
- 'r' appears 1 time in the list.
- 'n' appears 1 time in the list.
- 'g' appears 1 time in the list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input list is a new list with the counts of each element as they appear in the original list: `[1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
