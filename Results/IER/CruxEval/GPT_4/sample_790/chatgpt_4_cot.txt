The function f takes a dictionary d as input and performs the following steps:
1. It creates a new dictionary r with two keys: 'c' and 'd'.
2. Both keys 'c' and 'd' are assigned the value of a copy of the input dictionary d using the copy() method.
3. The function returns a tuple with two elements:
   - The first element is the result of the comparison (r['c'] is r['d']), which checks if r['c'] and r['d'] are the same object in memory (identity).
   - The second element is the result of the comparison (r['c'] == r['d']), which checks if r['c'] and r['d'] have the same content (equality).

Since the copy() method creates a shallow copy of the dictionary, r['c'] and r['d'] will be two different objects with the same content. Therefore, the first comparison (r['c'] is r['d']) will be False, and the second comparison (r['c'] == r['d']) will be True.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets'}, we can apply the above steps:
- r['c'] and r['d'] will both be copies of {'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets'}.
- r['c'] is not the same object as r['d'], so the first element of the tuple will be False.
- r['c'] has the same content as r['d'], so the second element of the tuple will be True.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets'} is (False, True).
