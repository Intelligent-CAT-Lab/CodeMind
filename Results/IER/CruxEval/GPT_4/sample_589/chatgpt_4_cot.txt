<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list num as input and performs the following operations:
1. It appends the last element of the list num to the end of the list itself. This is done using the expression num[-1], which accesses the last element of the list, and the append method, which adds this element to the end of the list.
2. It then returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `[-70, 20, 9, 1]`, we need to follow these steps:
- The last element of the list `[-70, 20, 9, 1]` is `1`.
- We append this element to the end of the list, resulting in `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`.
- The function then returns this modified list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input `[-70, 20, 9, 1]` is `[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]`.
