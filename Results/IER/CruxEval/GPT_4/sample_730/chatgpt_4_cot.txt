<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string `text` as input and initializes two variables `m` and `cnt` to 0. It then splits the input string into words and iterates over each word.

For each word `i` in the split text, the function checks if the length of the word is greater than the current maximum length `m`. If it is, it increments the counter `cnt` by 1 and updates `m` to the new maximum length, which is the length of the current word.

Let's analyze the input "wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl" step by step:

1. "wys" has a length of 3, which is greater than the current maximum `m` (0), so `cnt` becomes 1 and `m` becomes 3.
2. "silak" has a length of 5, which is greater than the current maximum `m` (3), so `cnt` becomes 2 and `m` becomes 5.
3. "v5" has a length of 2, which is not greater than the current maximum `m` (5), so no change.
4. "e4fi" has a length of 4, which is not greater than the current maximum `m` (5), so no change.
5. "rotbi" has a length of 5, which is equal to the current maximum `m` (5), so no change.
6. "fwj" has a length of 3, which is not greater than the current maximum `m` (5), so no change.
7. "78" has a length of 2, which is not greater than the current maximum `m` (5), so no change.
8. "wigf" has a length of 4, which is not greater than the current maximum `m` (5), so no change.
9. "t8s" has a length of 3, which is not greater than the current maximum `m` (5), so no change.
10. "lcl" has a length of 3, which is not greater than the current maximum `m` (5), so no change.

After iterating through all the words, the function returns the value of `cnt`, which is 2.
