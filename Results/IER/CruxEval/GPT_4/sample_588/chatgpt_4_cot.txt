<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of items and a target value. It checks if the target value is present in the list of items. If it is, the function returns the index of the target in the list. If the target is not in the list, the function returns -1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `['1', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+']` with the target `**`, we need to check if `**` is in the list and then find its index.

The target `**` is indeed in the list, and its index is 3 (since indexing starts at 0).

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input with the target `**` is 3.
