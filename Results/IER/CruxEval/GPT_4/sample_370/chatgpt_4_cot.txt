<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and iterates over each character in the string.
For each character, it checks if the character is not a whitespace character using the `isspace()` method.
If it finds a character that is not a whitespace (meaning `char.isspace()` is False), it immediately returns False.
If all characters are whitespace, it completes the loop and returns True.

In the given input '     i', the function will iterate over the characters.
It will pass over the whitespace characters until it reaches 'i'.
Since 'i' is not a whitespace character, the condition `not char.isspace()` will be True, and the function will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
