<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of vectors (which are themselves lists) as input and returns a list of these vectors sorted individually.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [], we need to follow the steps in the function:
1. An empty list called sorted_vecs is initialized.
2. The function then iterates over each vector in the input list. Since the input list is empty, the loop does not execute.
3. The function returns the sorted_vecs list, which remains empty as no elements were added to it during the loop.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [] is an empty list.
<<<Output>>>
[]
