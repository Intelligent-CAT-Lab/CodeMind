<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string doc as input and iterates through each character in the string.
For each character x in the string, it checks if the character is an alphabetic character using the isalpha() method.
If x is an alphabetic character, the function returns the capitalized version of x using the capitalize() method and stops executing.
Since 'raruwa' is composed entirely of alphabetic characters, the function will find an alphabetic character on the first iteration (the character 'r').
The first character 'r' will be capitalized to 'R' and returned.
The function will not proceed to check the rest of the characters after returning 'R'.
<<<Output>>>
'R'
