<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the boolean value of the negation of text.isdecimal().
The isdecimal() method checks whether all characters in the string are decimal characters. This means that it returns True if the string contains only numeric characters that are used to form numbers in base 10, and False otherwise.
The input string 'the speed is -36 miles per hour' contains alphabetic characters, spaces, and a negative sign, none of which are decimal characters.
Therefore, text.isdecimal() will return False for this input string.
The function f returns the negation of False, which is True.
<<<Output>>>
True
