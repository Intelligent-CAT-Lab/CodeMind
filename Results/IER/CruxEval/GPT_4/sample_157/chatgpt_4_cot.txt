<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string phrase as input and initializes a variable ans to 0. It then splits the input string into words and iterates over each word. For each word, it iterates over each character and checks if the character is "0". If it is, it increments ans by 1.

Let's analyze the input "aboba 212 has 0 digits" step by step:
1. The input string is split into words: ["aboba", "212", "has", "0", "digits"].
2. The function iterates over each word:
   - "aboba": No "0" characters.
   - "212": No "0" characters.
   - "has": No "0" characters.
   - "0": There is one "0" character, so ans is incremented by 1.
   - "digits": No "0" characters.
3. After iterating over all words, the value of ans is 1, as there was only one "0" character found in the fourth word.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "aboba 212 has 0 digits" is 1.
