<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input and checks if the list is the same when reversed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 3, 6, 2], we need to reverse the list and compare it to the original list.
The reversed list is [2, 6, 3, 0].
Since [2, 6, 3, 0] is not equal to [0, 3, 6, 2], the condition nums[::-1] == nums is False.
Therefore, the function will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
