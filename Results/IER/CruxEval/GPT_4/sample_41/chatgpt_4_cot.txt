The function f takes two arguments: an array and a list of values. It performs the following steps:

1. Reverse the array. Initially, the array is [58]. After reversing, it remains [58] since it contains only one element.
2. Iterate over the list of values, which is [21, 92].
3. For each value in the list of values, insert it into the middle of the array. The middle index is calculated as len(array) // 2.
   - When inserting the first value (21), the array has 1 element, so the middle index is 1 // 2 = 0. The value 21 is inserted at index 0, resulting in the array [21, 58].
   - When inserting the second value (92), the array has 2 elements, so the middle index is 2 // 2 = 1. The value 92 is inserted at index 1, resulting in the array [21, 92, 58].
4. Reverse the array again. The array [21, 92, 58] becomes [58, 92, 21] after reversing.

The final array after all these operations is [58, 92, 21].
<<<Output>>>
[58, 92, 21]
