<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a string s and a character c. The string s is first split into a list of words using the split method with a space character as the delimiter. The resulting list is then reversed using the [::-1] slice notation. The reversed list of words is then joined back into a string with two spaces "  " as the separator. Finally, the character c is concatenated with two spaces "  " and this string is concatenated with the reversed and joined string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'Hello There' and '*', we perform the following steps:
1. Split 'Hello There' into a list of words: ['Hello', 'There']
2. Reverse the list: ['There', 'Hello']
3. Join the reversed list with two spaces as the separator: 'There  Hello'
4. Concatenate '*' with two spaces: '*  '
5. Concatenate the result of step 4 with the result of step 3: '*  There  Hello'

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'Hello There' and '*' is '*  There  Hello'.
<<<Output>>>
'*  There  Hello'
