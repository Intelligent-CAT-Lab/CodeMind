<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: an array (list), an index number (i_num), and an element (elem) to be inserted into the array.
The function uses the list's insert method to insert the element at the specified index in the array.
The insert method modifies the original list in place.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([ -4, 1, 0], 1, 4):
- The initial array is [-4, 1, 0].
- The index number where the element is to be inserted is 1.
- The element to be inserted is 4.

The insert operation will place the element 4 at index 1 of the array. The array after the insert operation will be:
- Before insertion: [-4, 1, 0]
- After insertion:  [-4, 4, 1, 0]

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input will be the modified array [-4, 4, 1, 0].
<<<Output>>>
[-4, 4, 1, 0]
