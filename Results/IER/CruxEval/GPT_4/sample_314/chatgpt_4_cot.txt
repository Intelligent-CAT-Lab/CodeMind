<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and checks if there is a comma in the text.
If there is a comma, it uses the partition method to split the text into three parts: before the comma, the comma itself, and after the comma. It then returns the concatenation of the after part, a space, and the before part.
If there is no comma, it returns a string that starts with a comma, followed by the last word in the text (obtained by partitioning the text by space and taking the last part), and then a space and the number 0.

For the input '244, 105, -90', the function will find a comma and partition the text into '244', ',', ' 105, -90'. It will then return ' 105, -90' + ' ' + '244', which results in ' 105, -90 244'.

<<<Output>>>
' 105, -90 244'
