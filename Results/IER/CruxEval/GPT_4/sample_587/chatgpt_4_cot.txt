<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of numbers `nums` and a value `fill`.
The function uses the `dict.fromkeys()` method to create a dictionary where each unique element in the list `nums` becomes a key, and the value for each key is set to `fill`.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `[0, 1, 1, 2]` and `'abcca'`, we need to follow these steps:
1. Identify the unique elements in the list `[0, 1, 1, 2]`, which are `0`, `1`, and `2`.
2. Use these unique elements as keys in the new dictionary.
3. Assign the value `'abcca'` to each key in the dictionary.

Since `1` appears twice in the list, it will only be represented once as a key in the dictionary.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input will be a dictionary with keys `0`, `1`, and `2`, each having the value `'abcca'`.
<<<Output>>>
{0: 'abcca', 1: 'abcca', 2: 'abcca'}
