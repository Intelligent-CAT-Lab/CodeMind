The function f takes two arguments: a dictionary `data` and an integer `num`.
It then creates an empty dictionary `new_dict` and converts the items of `data` into a list of tuples called `temp`.
The for loop iterates from the last index of `temp` to the index `num`, decrementing by 1 each time.
For each iteration, it adds the current tuple from `temp` to `new_dict` with the value `None`.
After the loop, the function returns a list that is the concatenation of the slice of `temp` from index `num` to the end and the items of `new_dict`.

Let's break down the execution with the given input `f({1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1}, 1)`:
1. `data` is `{1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1}` and `num` is `1`.
2. `temp` becomes `[(1, 9), (2, 10), (3, 1)]`.
3. The for loop starts at index `2` (the last index of `temp`) and ends at index `1` (the value of `num`).
4. In the first iteration, `i` is `2`, so `new_dict` becomes `{(3, 1): None}`.
5. The loop ends as it was supposed to run only once (from index `2` to `1`).
6. The function returns the concatenation of `temp[1:]` (which is `[(2, 10), (3, 1)]`) and `list(new_dict.items())` (which is `[((3, 1), None)]`).

Therefore, the final output will be a list of tuples: `[(2, 10), (3, 1), ((3, 1), None)]`.
