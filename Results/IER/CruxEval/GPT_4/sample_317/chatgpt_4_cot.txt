<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a string `text`, and two characters `a` and `b`. It performs the following operations:
1. Replace all occurrences of character `a` in `text` with character `b`.
2. Replace all occurrences of character `b` in the modified `text` with character `a`.

Let's apply these steps to the input `f(' vup a zwwo oihee amuwuuw! ', 'a', 'u')`:
1. Replace all 'a' with 'u': The string becomes ' vup u zwwo oihee umuwuuw! '.
2. Replace all 'u' with 'a': The string becomes ' vap a zwwo oiaee amawaaaw! '.

Therefore, the final output of the function f with the given input will be ' vap a zwwo oiaee amawaaaw! '.
<<<Output>>>
' vap a zwwo oiaee amawaaaw! '
