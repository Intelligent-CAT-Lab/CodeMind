<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list list_x as input and performs the following steps:
1. It calculates the length of the input list and stores it in the variable item_count.
2. It initializes an empty list new_list.
3. It then enters a for loop that iterates item_count times.
4. In each iteration, it pops the last element from list_x and appends it to new_list.
5. Since the pop() method removes the last element from the list, the elements are appended to new_list in reverse order.
6. After the loop finishes, the function returns new_list.

For the input [5, 8, 6, 8, 4]:
- item_count is 5.
- The loop will run 5 times.
- In each iteration, the last element of list_x is popped and appended to new_list.
- The elements are appended to new_list in the following order: 4, 8, 6, 8, 5.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 6, 8, 4] is [4, 8, 6, 8, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 8, 6, 8, 5]
