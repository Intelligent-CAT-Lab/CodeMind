<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and creates a new list called new. It then iterates over the length of lst in reverse order, appending elements to the new list with a condition based on the index i.

Here's the step-by-step analysis for the input [1, 7, -1, -3]:

1. The length of lst is 4, so i starts at 3 (len(lst) - 1).
2. The loop will run 4 times because len(lst) is 4.
3. In the first iteration, i is 3, which is odd, so lst[i] (which is -3) is appended to new.
4. In the second iteration, i is 2, which is even, so -lst[i] (which is 1) is appended to new.
5. In the third iteration, i is 1, which is odd, so lst[i] (which is 7) is appended to new.
6. In the fourth and final iteration, i is 0, which is even, so -lst[i] (which is -1) is appended to new.
7. The final new list is [-3, 1, 7, -1].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 7, -1, -3] is [-3, 1, 7, -1].
