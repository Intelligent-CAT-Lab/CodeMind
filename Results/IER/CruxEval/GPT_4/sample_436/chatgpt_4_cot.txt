<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `s` and a list of integers `characters`. It returns a list of substrings from `s`, where each substring is created by taking a single character from `s` at the index specified by each integer in `characters`.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input `'s7 6s 1ss'` and `[1, 3, 6, 1, 2]`, we need to extract characters from the string `'s7 6s 1ss'` at the indices 1, 3, 6, 1, and 2.

Here are the characters at the specified indices:
- Index 1: '7'
- Index 3: '6'
- Index 6: 's'
- Index 1 (again): '7'
- Index 2: ' '

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input is a list containing the characters ['7', '6', 's', '7', ' '].
<<<Output>>>
['7', '6', 's', '7', ' ']
