The function f takes two arguments: a list of numbers called nums and an integer called index. It performs two operations:
1. It calculates the remainder of the element at the given index in the list when divided by 42.
2. It removes the element at the given index from the list using the pop method and multiplies it by 2.

The return value of the function is the sum of the two results from the operations above.

Let's break down the execution step by step for the input `f([3, 2, 0, 3, 7], 3)`:
- The index provided is 3, so we look at the element at index 3 in the list, which is the number 3.
- We calculate 3 % 42, which is 3 because 3 is less than 42 and thus the remainder of the division is 3 itself.
- We then pop the element at index 3 from the list, which modifies the list to [3, 2, 0, 7] and gives us the value 3.
- We multiply the popped value by 2, resulting in 3 * 2 = 6.
- Finally, we add the two results together: 3 (remainder) + 6 (popped value multiplied by 2) = 9.

Therefore, the return value of the function f when called with the arguments ([3, 2, 0, 3, 7], 3) is 9.
