<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input and performs the following steps:
1. It creates a list called 'floats' by taking the modulo 1 of each number in the input list. The modulo operation n % 1 returns the decimal part of the number n. Since the input is a range of integers, the decimal part will always be 0.
2. The function then checks if the value 1 is present in the 'floats' list. Since all the elements in the 'floats' list are 0 (because the input is a range of integers), the value 1 will never be present.
3. If the value 1 were present in the 'floats' list, the function would return the 'floats' list. Otherwise, it returns an empty list.

Given the input range(100, 120), the 'floats' list will be a list of 0s because all numbers in the range are integers and their decimal part is 0. Since 1 is not in the list, the function will return an empty list.
