<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, n and m. It first creates a list called arr with a range of numbers from 1 to n inclusive. Then it enters a loop that runs m times, and in each iteration, it clears the arr list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs n=1 and m=3, we follow these steps:
1. Create a list arr with numbers from 1 to n (1 in this case), so arr = [1].
2. Enter a loop that will run m (3) times.
3. In each iteration of the loop, clear the arr list. After the first iteration, arr becomes an empty list [].
4. Since the loop runs 3 times, arr remains an empty list after all iterations.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs n=1 and m=3 is an empty list [].
