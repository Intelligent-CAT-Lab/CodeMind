<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input: 'full' and 'part'. It calculates the number of times 'part' occurs in 'full' without overlapping.

1. The length of 'part' is calculated using len(part), which is 2 since 'part' is 'hr'.
2. The index of the first occurrence of 'part' in 'full' is found using full.find(part), which is 0 because 'hr' starts at the beginning of 'full'.
3. A count variable is initialized to 0.
4. A while loop is used to find all occurrences of 'part' in 'full'. The loop continues as long as index is greater than or equal to 0, meaning 'part' is found in 'full'.
5. Inside the loop, 'full' is updated to be the substring starting from the character after the found 'part' using full[index + length:].
6. The index is updated to the next occurrence of 'part' in the updated 'full' using full.find(part).
7. The count is incremented by 1 each time 'part' is found.

Let's go through the loop iterations:
- First iteration: index = 0, full = 'hrsiajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy', count = 1. After updating 'full', it becomes 'siajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy'.
- Second iteration: index = 10, full = 'siajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy', count = 2. After updating 'full', it becomes 'uejfhbrisvlmmy'.
- Third iteration: index = -1, full = 'uejfhbrisvlmmy', count = 2. The loop ends because index is now less than 0.

The function returns the count, which is 2, indicating that 'hr' was found twice in the original 'full' string without overlapping.
