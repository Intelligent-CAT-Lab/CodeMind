<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and checks if the entire string is in uppercase letters.
The string method isupper() is used to determine if all the characters in the string are uppercase.
If all characters are uppercase, isupper() returns True, and thus the function f returns True.
If any character is not uppercase, isupper() returns False, and thus the function f returns False.
For the input 'Ohno', the string is not entirely in uppercase because it starts with an uppercase 'O' but is followed by lowercase 'hno'.
Therefore, the string 'Ohno' does not satisfy the condition of isupper(), and the function will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
