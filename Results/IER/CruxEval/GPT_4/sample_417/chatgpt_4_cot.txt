<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and performs the following operations:
1. It reverses the list. The list [7, 8, 2, 8] becomes [8, 2, 8, 7].
2. It pops the last element from the list. The last element of [8, 2, 8, 7] is 7, so after popping, the list becomes [8, 2, 8].
3. It reverses the list again. The list [8, 2, 8] becomes [8, 2, 8].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 8, 2, 8] is [8, 2, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[8, 2, 8]
