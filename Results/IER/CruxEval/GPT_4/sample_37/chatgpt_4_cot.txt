<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string 'text' as input and initializes an empty list 'text_arr'.
It then enters a for loop that iterates over the length of the input string 'text', which in this case is 3 ('123' has three characters).
For each iteration, it appends a substring of 'text' starting from the current index 'j' to the end of the string to 'text_arr'.
In the first iteration (j=0), it appends the entire string '123' to 'text_arr'.
In the second iteration (j=1), it appends the substring '23' to 'text_arr'.
In the third iteration (j=2), it appends the substring '3' to 'text_arr'.
After the loop finishes, 'text_arr' contains ['123', '23', '3'].
The function then returns 'text_arr'.
<<<Output>>>
['123', '23', '3']
