<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list called array as input and performs the following operations:
1. It removes the last element of the list using the pop() method and stores it in the variable n.
2. It then extends the list by adding two elements, both of which are the value stored in n.
3. Finally, it returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 2, 2], we follow these steps:
1. The last element of the list (2) is popped and stored in n.
2. The list now becomes [1, 1, 2].
3. The list is then extended by adding two 2's (the value of n) to the end of the list.
4. The final list becomes [1, 1, 2, 2, 2].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 2, 2] is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2].
