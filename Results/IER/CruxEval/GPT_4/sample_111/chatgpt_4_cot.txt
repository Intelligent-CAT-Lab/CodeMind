<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary called marks as input, where the keys are strings and the values are integers representing some kind of scores or marks.

The function initializes two variables, highest and lowest, with values 0 and 100, respectively.

It then iterates over the values of the dictionary with a for loop. For each value, it checks if the value is greater than the current highest value. If it is, it updates the highest variable with this new value.

Similarly, it checks if the value is less than the current lowest value. If it is, it updates the lowest variable with this new value.

After iterating through all the values, the function returns a tuple containing the highest and lowest values found.

For the given input `{'x': 67, 'v': 89, '': 4, 'alij': 11, 'kgfsd': 72, 'yafby': 83}`, the function will process the values in the following way:

- Start with highest = 0 and lowest = 100.
- Value 67: higher than highest (0), so highest becomes 67. Not lower than lowest (100).
- Value 89: higher than highest (67), so highest becomes 89. Not lower than lowest (100).
- Value 4: not higher than highest (89). Lower than lowest (100), so lowest becomes 4.
- Value 11: not higher than highest (89). Not lower than lowest (4).
- Value 72: not higher than highest (89). Not lower than lowest (4).
- Value 83: not higher than highest (89). Not lower than lowest (4).

After processing all values, the highest is 89 and the lowest is 4. Therefore, the function will return a tuple (89, 4).

(89, 4)
