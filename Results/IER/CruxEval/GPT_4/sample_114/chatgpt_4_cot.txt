<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string `text` and a string `sep`. It returns a list of the words in the string, using `sep` as the delimiter string, splitting from the right and performing at most 2 splits.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "a-.-.b" with the separator "-.", we need to perform the following steps:
1. Identify the separator "-." in the string "a-.-.b".
2. Split the string from the right, at most 2 times, using the identified separator.
3. Since there is only one occurrence of the separator "-." in the string, it will be split into two parts: "a" and "b".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "a-.-.b" with the separator "-." is a list containing the strings "a" and "b".
<<<Output>>>
['a', 'b']
