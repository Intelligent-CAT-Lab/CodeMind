<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a string `text`, a string `sep`, and an integer `num`. It returns a new string that is the result of joining the list of strings obtained by splitting `text` from the right side at most `num` times by the separator `sep`, using '___' as the new separator.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('aa+++bb', '+', 1), we need to perform the following steps:
1. Split the string 'aa+++bb' from the right side at most 1 time using '+' as the separator. This results in the list ['aa++', 'bb'].
2. Join the elements of the list ['aa++', 'bb'] using '___' as the new separator. This results in the string 'aa++___bb'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('aa+++bb', '+', 1) is 'aa++___bb'.
<<<Output>>>
'aa++___bb'
