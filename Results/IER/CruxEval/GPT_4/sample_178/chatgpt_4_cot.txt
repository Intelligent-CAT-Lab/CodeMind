<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two parameters: an array and an integer n. It returns a slice of the array starting from the index n to the end of the array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2] and integer 4, we need to slice the array starting from index 4.
Index 4 corresponds to the fifth element of the array (since indexing starts at 0), which is the first occurrence of the value 2 in the array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the given input will be a slice of the array starting from the fifth element to the end, which is [2, 2, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 2, 2]
