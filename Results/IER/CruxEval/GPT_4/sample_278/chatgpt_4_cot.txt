The function f takes two lists, array1 and array2, as input and returns a dictionary where each key is an element from array1 and the corresponding value is a list of elements from array2 that are less than twice the key.

Step 1: Create a dictionary with keys from array1 and None values using dict.fromkeys(array1). The initial result will be {0: None, 132: None}.

Step 2: Iterate over the keys in the result dictionary.

Step 3: For each key, create a list comprehension that iterates over elements in array2 and includes only those elements that are less than twice the key.

For key 0:
- The list comprehension checks if 0 * 2 > el for each element in array2.
- Since 0 * 2 is 0, no element in array2 will satisfy the condition 0 > el.
- The value for key 0 in the result dictionary will be an empty list [].

For key 132:
- The list comprehension checks if 132 * 2 > el for each element in array2.
- 132 * 2 is 264, so it checks if 264 > el for each element in array2.
- The elements in array2 that satisfy this condition are 5, 32.
- The value for key 132 in the result dictionary will be [5, 32].

Step 4: Return the result dictionary.

The final result will be a dictionary with keys from array1 and values that are lists of elements from array2 that are less than twice the corresponding key.
<<<Output>>>
{0: [], 132: [5, 32]}
