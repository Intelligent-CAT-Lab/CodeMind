<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a string s and a character ch. It performs the following steps:

1. Checks if the character ch is not in the string s. If it is not, the function returns an empty string.
2. If ch is in s, it partitions the string s at the first occurrence of ch and takes the substring after ch. This substring is then reversed.
3. It then enters a loop that runs for the length of the reversed substring obtained in step 2.
4. Inside the loop, it again partitions the string s at the first occurrence of ch and takes the substring after ch. This substring is then reversed.
5. After the loop, it returns the string s.

Let's apply these steps to the input `f('shivajimonto6', '6')`:

1. The character '6' is in the string 'shivajimonto6', so we proceed to the next step.
2. The string is partitioned at '6', resulting in the tuple ('shivajimonto', '6', ''). The third element of the tuple is an empty string, which when reversed is still an empty string.
3. The loop will run for the length of the empty string, which is 0 times. Therefore, the loop does not execute.
4. Since the loop does not execute, the string s remains an empty string.
5. The function returns the empty string.
