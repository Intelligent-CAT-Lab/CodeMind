The function f takes a list of vectors as input and returns a list of sorted vectors.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [], we need to sort each vector in the list and then append the sorted vectors to a new list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [] is an empty list.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(vectors):
    sorted_vecs = []
    for vec in vectors:
        vec.sort()
        sorted_vecs.append(vec)
    return sorted_vecs
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
