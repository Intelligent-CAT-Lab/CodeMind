The function f takes two strings as input and returns the sum of the number of occurrences of the second string in the first string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'jivespdcxc' and'sx', we need to count the number of occurrences of'sx' in 'jivespdcxc' and sum the results.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'jivespdcxc' and'sx' is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text1, text2):
    nums = []
    for i in range(len(text2)):
        nums.append(text1.count(text2[i]))
    return sum(nums)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('jivespdcxc','sx')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
