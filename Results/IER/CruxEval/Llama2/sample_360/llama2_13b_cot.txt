The function f takes a string text and an integer n as input.
The function returns the string text if the length of text is less than or equal to 2.
Otherwise, the function returns the string leading_chars, which is the string text[0] repeated n - len(text) + 1 times, followed by the string text[1:-1], which is the string text with the first and last characters removed, and finally the string text[-1], which is the last character of the string text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'g' and n = 15, we need to determine the length of the string 'g'.
The length of 'g' is 2, so the function returns the string 'gg'.
<<<Output>>>
'gg'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, n):
    if len(text) <= 2:
        return text
    leading_chars = text[0] * (n - len(text) + 1)
    return leading_chars + text[1:-1] + text[-1]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('g', 15)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
