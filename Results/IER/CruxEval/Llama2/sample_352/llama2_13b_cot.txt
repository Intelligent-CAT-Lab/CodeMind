The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns the middle element of the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, -3, -5, -7, 0], we need to find the middle element of the list.
The list has an even number of elements, so the middle element is the element at index (len(nums)//2).
The index of the middle element is (len(nums)//2), which is 2.
Therefore, the middle element of the list is the element at index 2, which is -5.
<<<Output>>>
-5

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    return nums[len(nums)//2]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-1, -3, -5, -7, 0])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
