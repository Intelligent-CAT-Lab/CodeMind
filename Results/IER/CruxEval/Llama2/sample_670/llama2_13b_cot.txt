The function f takes two lists as input, a and b.
The function d is used to create a dictionary that maps the elements of a to the elements of b.
The function a is used to sort the elements of a in descending order based on the values of the dictionary d.
The function d is used to remove the first element of a from the dictionary d.
The function d is used to return a list of the elements of a in descending order.

The return value of the function f on the input ['12','ab'], [2,2] is ['ab', '12'].
<<<Output>>>
['ab', '12']

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b):
    d = dict(zip(a, b))
    a.sort(key=d.get, reverse=True)
    return [d.pop(x) for x in a]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['12','ab'], [2,2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
