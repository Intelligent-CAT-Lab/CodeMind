The function f takes a string x as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string x is a valid integer.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '1', we need to check if the string '1' is a valid integer.
A string is a valid integer if it consists only of digits and has a length equal to the number of digits in the integer.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '1' is True.
<<<Output>>>
True

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    n = len(x)
    i = 0
    while i < n and x[i].isdigit():
        i += 1
    return i == n
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('123')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
