The function f takes two inputs: a list a and a string b.
The function f first assigns the string b to the variable a.
Then, the function f creates a list lst that contains the elements of a.
For each element in a, the function f creates two sublists, one containing the first half of the element and the other containing the second half of the element.
Finally, the function f returns the list lst.
<<<Output>>>
['a', 'b', 'c','', 'a', 'b', 'c']

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b):
    a = b.join(a)
    lst = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)+1, 2):
        lst.append(a[i-1:][:i])
        lst.append(a[i-1:][i:])
    return lst
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(["a", "b", "c"], " ")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
