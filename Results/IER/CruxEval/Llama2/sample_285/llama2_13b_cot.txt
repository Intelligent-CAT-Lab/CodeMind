The function f takes two arguments: a string text and a character ch.
The function returns the number of occurrences of the character ch in the string text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!", we need to count the number of occurrences of the character'' (space) in the string.

There are two occurrences of the character'' in the string, so the output of executing the function f on the input "This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!" is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, ch):
    """Counting vowels in Pirates' Curse"""
    return text.count(ch)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("This be Pirate's Speak for 'help'!",'')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
