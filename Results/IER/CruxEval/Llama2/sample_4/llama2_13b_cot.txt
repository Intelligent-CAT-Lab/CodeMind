The function f takes an array as input and returns a string.
The array is a list of strings, each of which is a single space.
The function f concatenates the strings in the array into a single string, separated by spaces.
The function f then returns the concatenated string.

The output of executing the function f on the input array is a single string consisting of five spaces.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    s =''
    s += ''.join(array)
    return s
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([' ',' ','   ','  '])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
