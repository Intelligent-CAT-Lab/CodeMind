The function f takes a string code as input and returns a string that is the concatenation of the string code with the string representation of the bytes encoded from the string code.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '148', we need to concatenate '148' with the string representation of the bytes encoded from '148'.
The bytes encoded from '148' are the bytes '1', '4', '8', and the string representation of these bytes is '148'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '148' is '148: 148'.
<<<Output>>>
'148: 148'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(code):
    return "{}: {}".format(code, code.encode())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('148')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
