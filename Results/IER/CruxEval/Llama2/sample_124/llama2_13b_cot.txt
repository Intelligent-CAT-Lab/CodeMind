The function f takes three arguments: txt, sep, and sep_count.
txt is a string that contains the text to be processed.
sep is a string that specifies the separator to be used.
sep_count is an integer that specifies the number of times the separator should be used.

The function f returns a string that is the result of processing the input text.
The function f uses the method "rsplit" to split the input text into a list of strings based on the separator.
The function f then uses the method "join" to join the list of strings back into a single string.
The function f then returns the joined string.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(txt, sep, sep_count):
    o = ''
    while sep_count > 0 and txt.count(sep) > 0:
        o += txt.rsplit(sep, 1)[0] + sep
        txt = txt.rsplit(sep, 1)[1]
        sep_count -= 1
    return o + txt
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('i like you','', -1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
