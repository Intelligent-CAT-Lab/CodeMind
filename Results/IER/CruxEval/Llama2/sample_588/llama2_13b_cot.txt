The function f takes two arguments: a list of items and a target.
The function returns the index of the target in the list of items if the target is found in the list of items.
Otherwise, the function returns -1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['1', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+'], '**', we need to check if the target '**' is found in the list of items.
If the target is found, we need to return the index of the target in the list of items.
Otherwise, we need to return -1.

To check if the target '**' is found in the list of items, we can use the in operator.
The in operator returns True if the target is found in the list of items, and False otherwise.

To determine the index of the target in the list of items, we can use the index operator.
The index operator returns the index of the target in the list of items.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['1', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+'], '**' is -1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(items, target):
    if target in items:
        return items.index(target)
    return -1
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['''1''', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+'], '**')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
