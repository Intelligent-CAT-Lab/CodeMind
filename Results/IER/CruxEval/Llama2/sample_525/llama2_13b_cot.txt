The function f takes three arguments: a dictionary c, a start string st, and an end string ed.
The function creates a dictionary d that maps each key in c to its value.
The function then iterates over the items in c, and for each item (key, value), it adds the key to the dictionary d with the value as the key.
If the key is equal to the start string, the function sets the variable a to the value of the key.
If the key is equal to the end string, the function sets the variable b to the value of the key.
The function then returns a tuple containing the value of the variable w, which is the value of the key in d that is equal to the start string, and the value of the variable b, which is the value of the key in d that is equal to the end string.

The function returns the tuple (w, b) if the value of a is greater than the value of b, and it returns the tuple (b, w) if the value of a is less than or equal to the value of b.

The function returns the tuple (w, b) if the value of a is greater than the value of b, and it returns the tuple (b, w) if the value of a is less than or equal to the value of b.

The function returns the tuple (w, b) if the value of a is greater than the value of b, and it returns the tuple (b, w) if the value of a is less than or equal to the value of b.

The function returns the tuple (w, b) if the value of a is greater than the value of b, and it returns the tuple (b, w) if the value of a is less than or equal to the value of b.

The function returns the tuple (w, b) if the value of a is greater than the value of b, and it returns the tuple (b, w) if the value of a is less than or equal to the value of b.

The function returns the tuple (w, b) if the value of a is greater than the value of b, and it returns the tuple (b, w) if the value of a is less than or equal to the value of b.

The function returns the tuple (w, b) if the value of a is
