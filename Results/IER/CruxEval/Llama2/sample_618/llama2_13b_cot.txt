The function f takes three arguments: match, fill, and n.
The function returns the concatenation of the first n characters of fill with match.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '9', '8', 2, we need to concatenate the first 2 characters of '8' with '9'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '9', '8', 2 is '98'.
<<<Output>>>
'98'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(match, fill, n):
    return fill[:n] + match
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('9', '8', 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
