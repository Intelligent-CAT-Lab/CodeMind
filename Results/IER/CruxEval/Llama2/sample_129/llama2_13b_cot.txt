The function f takes a string text and a search string as input.
The function returns a list of indexes where the search string is found in the text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ' and the search string 'J', we need to find all the indexes where the search string 'J' is found in the text.

The search string 'J' is found at the following indexes in the text:

- The first index is 13, which is the index of the character 'J' in the text.
- The second index is 20, which is the index of the character 'J' in the text.
- The third index is 27, which is the index of the character 'J' in the text.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ' and the search string 'J' is [13, 20, 27].

[13, 20, 27]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, search_string):
    indexes = []
    while search_string in text:
        indexes.append(text.rindex(search_string))
        text = text[:text.rindex(search_string)]
    return indexes
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ', 'J')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
