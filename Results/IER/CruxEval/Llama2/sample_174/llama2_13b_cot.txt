The function f takes a list lst as input and returns the list after performing the following operations:
1. The list is sliced from index 1 to index 4.
2. The sliced list is reversed.
3. The list is returned.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to perform the following steps:
1. Slice the list from index 1 to index 4.
2. Reverse the sliced list.
3. Return the list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [3, 2, 1].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    lst[1:4] = lst[1:4][::-1]
    return lst
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
