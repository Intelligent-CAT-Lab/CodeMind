The function f takes a list a as input and returns a new list b.
The function f first creates a copy of the input list a and then iterates over the list a, starting at index 0 and ending at index len(a) - 1, with a step size of 2.
For each iteration, the function f inserts the value at index k + 1 into the list b at index k.
Finally, the function f appends the value at index 0 of the list b to the end of the list b.

The input list a is [5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a):
    b = a.copy()
    for k in range(0, len(a) - 1, 2):
        b.insert(k + 1, b[k])
    b.append(b[0])
    return b
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
