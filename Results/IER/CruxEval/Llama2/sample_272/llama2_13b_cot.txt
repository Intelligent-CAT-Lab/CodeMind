The function f takes two arguments: a list base_list and a list nums.
The function f first extends the list base_list with the elements of the list nums.
Then, it creates a copy of the list base_list and appends the elements of the list base_list to the copy in reverse order.
Finally, it returns the copy of the list base_list.

To determine the return value of executing the function f on the input [9, 7, 5, 3, 1] and [2, 4, 6, 8, 0], we need to follow the steps outlined above.
First, we extend the list base_list with the elements of the list nums, resulting in the list [9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0].
Then, we create a copy of the list base_list and append the elements of the list base_list to the copy in reverse order.
This results in the list [0, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9].
Finally, we return the copy of the list base_list, resulting in the return value [0, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.
