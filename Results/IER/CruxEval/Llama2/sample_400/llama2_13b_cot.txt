The function f takes a multi-string as input and returns a string.
The multi-string is split into a list of strings.
The list of strings is then mapped to a list of booleans using the str.isascii function.
If True is in the list of booleans, the function returns a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the list of strings that are ASCII.
If True is not in the list of booleans, the function returns an empty string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'I am hungry! eat food.', we need to split the input into a list of strings, map the list of strings to a list of booleans using the str.isascii function, and then concatenate the strings in the list of strings that are ASCII.

The input 'I am hungry! eat food.' is split into a list of strings: ['I', 'am', 'hungry!', 'eat', 'food.']

The list of strings is then mapped to a list of booleans using the str.isascii function: [True, True, True, True, True]

If True is in the list of booleans, the function returns a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the list of strings that are ASCII.

The list of strings that are ASCII is ['I', 'am', 'hungry!', 'eat', 'food.']

The function returns the concatenation of these strings: 'I am hungry! eat food.'

If True is not in the list of booleans, the function returns an empty string.

The list of strings that are ASCII is []

The function returns an empty string: ''

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'I am hungry! eat food.' is 'I am hungry! eat food.'.
<<<Output>>>
'I am hungry! eat food.'
