The function f takes a list arr as input and returns a new list.
The function f first creates a new list n that contains all the even elements of arr.
It then adds the elements of arr to the list n to create a new list m.
The function f then iterates through the elements of m and removes any element that is not in n.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 6, 4, -2, 5], we need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new list n that contains all the even elements of the input list.
2. Add the elements of the input list to the list n to create a new list m.
3. Iterate through the elements of m and remove any element that is not in n.

The output of executing the function f on the input [3, 6, 4, -2, 5] is [3, 6, 4, -2].
<<<Output>>>
[3, 6, 4, -2]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(arr):
    n = [item for item in arr if item%2 == 0]
    m = n+arr
    for i in m:
        if m.index(i) >= len(n):
            m.remove(i)
    return m
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([3, 6, 4, -2, 5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
