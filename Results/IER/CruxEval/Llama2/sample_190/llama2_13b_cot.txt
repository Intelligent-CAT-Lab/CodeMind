The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string that is the concatenation of all lowercase letters in text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "980jio80jic kld094398IIl ", we need to concatenate all lowercase letters in the input string.
The input string contains the following lowercase letters: "i", "j", "k", "l", and "o".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "980jio80jic kld094398IIl " is "iio".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    short = ''
    for c in text:
        if(c.islower()):
            short += c
    return short
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('980jio80jic kld094398IIl ')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
