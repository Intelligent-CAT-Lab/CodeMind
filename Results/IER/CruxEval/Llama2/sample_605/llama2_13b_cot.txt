The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns the string "quack".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 5, 1, 7, 9, 3], we need to clear the list nums and return the string "quack".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 5, 1, 7, 9, 3] is "quack".
<<<Output>>>
'quack'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    nums.append(1)
    return "quack"
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([2, 5, 1, 7, 9, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
