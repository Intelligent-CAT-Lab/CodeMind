The function f takes three arguments: a list of integers nums, an integer spot, and an integer idx.
The function f inserts the integer idx at the position spot in the list nums and returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 0, 1, 1], 0, 9), we need to insert the integer 9 at the position 0 in the list [1, 0, 1, 1].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 0, 1, 1], 0, 9) is [9, 0, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[9, 0, 1, 1]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, spot, idx):
    nums.insert(spot, idx)
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 0, 1, 1], 0, 9)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on
