The function f takes a dictionary dic as input and returns a new dictionary dic2.
The new dictionary dic2 is created by using the zip function to create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the value of the dictionary and the key of the dictionary.
Then, the keys of the dictionary are used to create a new dictionary, where the keys are the keys of the dictionary and the values are the values of the dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {{-1: "a", 0: "b", 1: "c"}}, we need to create a new dictionary dic2 using the zip function and the keys of the dictionary.
The output of executing the function f on the input {{-1: "a", 0: "b", 1: "c"}} is {0: "b", 1: "c", -1: "a"}.
<<<Output>>>
{0: "b", 1: "c", -1: "a"}

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(dic):
    dic2 = dict(zip(dic.values(), dic.keys()))
    return dic2
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({-1: "a", 0: "b", 1: "c"})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
