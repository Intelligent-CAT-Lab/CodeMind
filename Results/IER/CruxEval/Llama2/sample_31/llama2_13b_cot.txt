The function f takes a string as input and returns the product of the number of uppercase letters in the string and the number 2 or 1.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "PoIOarTvpoead", we need to count the number of uppercase letters in the string.
The string "PoIOarTvpoead" contains 4 uppercase letters: "P", "O", "I", and "T".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "PoIOarTvpoead" is 4 * 2 = 8.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    upper = 0
    for c in string:
        if c.isupper():
            upper += 1
    return upper * (2,1)[upper % 2]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('PoIOarTvpoead')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
