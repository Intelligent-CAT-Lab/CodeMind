The function f takes an array and a number as input and returns a reversed array multiplied by the number.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2] and 1, we need to reverse the array [1, 2] and multiply it by 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2] and 1 is [2, 1].

[2, 1]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, num):
    reverse = False
    if num < 0:
        reverse = True
        num *= -1
    array = array[::-1] * num
    l = len(array)
    
    if reverse:
        array = array[::-1]
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2], 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
