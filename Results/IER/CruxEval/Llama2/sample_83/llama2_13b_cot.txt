The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'qq0tt', we need to split the input string into three parts using the 'rpartition' method.
The first part is 'qq', the second part is '0', and the third part is 'tt'.
Then, we need to check if the third part is empty.
If it is empty, we return the string '-1:-1'.
Otherwise, we use the 'find' method to find the index of the first '0' in the third part.
Then, we return a string that contains the length of the first part and the index of the first '0' in the third part.
<<<Output>>>
'2:1'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    l = text.rpartition('0')
    if l[2] == '':
        return '-1:-1'
    return f'{len(l[0])}:{l[2].find("0") + 1}'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('qq0tt')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
