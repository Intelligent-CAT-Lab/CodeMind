The function f takes a list xs as input and returns a new list.
The function f iterates over the list xs and for each element i, it appends the element i and the element i to the list xs.
The function f then returns the list xs.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 8, 5], we need to iterate over the list [4, 8, 8, 5] and for each element i, append the element i and the element i to the list [4, 8, 8, 5].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 8, 8, 5] is [4, 8, 8, 5, 4, 8, 8, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 8, 8, 5, 4, 8, 8, 5]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(xs):
    for i in range(-1, -len(xs)-1, -1):
        xs.extend([xs[i], xs[i]])
    return xs
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([4, 8, 8, 5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
