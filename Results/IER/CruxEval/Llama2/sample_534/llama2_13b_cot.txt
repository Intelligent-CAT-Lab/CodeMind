The function f takes a sequence of characters and a value as input.
It returns the result of a recursive function that iterates over the sequence of characters starting from the index of the value in the sequence.
The function uses the index of the value in the sequence to determine the starting point of the iteration.
The function then iterates over the sequence of characters starting from the index of the value in the sequence.
If the character at the current index is '+', the function adds the value to the result.
Otherwise, the function adds the character at the current index to the result.
The function returns the result of the iteration.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'hosu' and 'o', we need to iterate over the sequence of characters starting from the index of 'o' in the sequence.
The index of 'o' in the sequence is 2, so the function starts the iteration at index 2.
The first character at index 2 is's', so the function adds 'o' to the result.
The next character at index 3 is 'u', so the function adds 'u' to the result.
The next character at index 4 is's', so the function adds's' to the result.
The next character at index 5 is '+', so the function adds 'o' to the result.
The next character at index 6 is 'o', so the function adds 'o' to the result.
The next character at index 7 is's', so the function adds's' to the result.
The next character at index 8 is 'u', so the function adds 'u' to the result.
The next character at index 9 is's', so the function adds's' to the result.
The next character at index 10 is '+', so the function adds 'o' to the result.
The next character at index 11 is 'o', so the function adds 'o' to the result.
The next character at index 12 is's', so the function adds's' to the result.
The next character at index 13 is 'u', so the function adds 'u' to the result.
The next character at index 14 is's', so the function adds's' to the result
