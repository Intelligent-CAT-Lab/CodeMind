The function f takes a list arr as input and returns the reversed list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5], we need to reverse the list.
The reversed list is [9999, 3, -5, 1, 0, 2].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5] is [9999, 3, -5, 1, 0, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[9999, 3, -5, 1, 0, 2]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(arr):
    return list(reversed(arr))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([2, 0, 1, 9999, 3, -5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
