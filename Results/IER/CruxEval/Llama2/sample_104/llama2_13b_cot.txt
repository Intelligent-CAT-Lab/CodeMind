The function f takes a string as input and returns a dictionary.
The dictionary is initialized to an empty dictionary.
For each character in the input string, the function adds 1 to the value of the character in the dictionary.
If the value of a character in the dictionary is greater than 1, the value is set to 1.
The return value of the function is the dictionary.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    dic = dict()
    for char in text:
        dic[char] = dic.get(char, 0) + 1
    for key in dic:
        if dic[key] > 1:
            dic[key] = 1
    return dic
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("a")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
