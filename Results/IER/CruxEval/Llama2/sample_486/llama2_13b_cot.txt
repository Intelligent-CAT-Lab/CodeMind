The function f takes a dictionary dic as input and returns a new dictionary dic_op.
The dictionary dic_op is a copy of the input dictionary dic.
For each key-value pair in dic, the value is squared and stored in dic_op.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input dictionary {1:1, 2:2, 3:3} is the dictionary {1:1, 2:4, 3:9}.
<<<Output>>>
{1:1, 2:4, 3:9}

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(dic):
    dic_op = dic.copy()
    for key, val in dic.items():
        dic_op[key] = val * val
    return dic_op
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({1:1, 2:2, 3:3})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
