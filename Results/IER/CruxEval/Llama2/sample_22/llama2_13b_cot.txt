The function f takes an integer a as input and returns the concatenation of a with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 000, we need to concatenate 000 with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 000 is "000a".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a):
    if a == 0:
        return [0]
    result = []
    while a > 0:
        result.append(a%10)
        a = a//10
    result.reverse()
    return int(''.join(str(i) for i in result))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(000)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
