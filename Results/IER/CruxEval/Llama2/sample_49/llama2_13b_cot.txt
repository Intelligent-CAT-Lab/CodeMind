The function f takes a string text as input and returns the concatenation of the string text with the string "".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "816", we need to concatenate "816" with "".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "816" is "816".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    if text.isidentifier():
        return ''.join(c for c in text if c.isdigit())
    else:
        return ''.join(text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('816')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
