The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The first step is to create a copy of the input array.
The second step is to reverse the order of the elements in the copy of the input array.
The third step is to multiply each element in the reversed copy of the input array by 2.
The output of the function f on the input array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is the array [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    result = array.copy()
    result.reverse()
    result[:] = [item * 2 for item in result]
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
