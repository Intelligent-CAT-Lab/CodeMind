The function f takes a list xs as input and returns a list.
The function f iterates over the list xs in reverse order, starting from the last element and working backwards to the first element.
For each element in the list, the function f inserts the element at the index specified by the variable idx, which is the index of the element in the list minus the length of the list.
The function f then removes the first element of the list and inserts it at the index specified by the variable idx.
The function f repeats this process until the list is empty.

The return value of the function f is the list that is generated by iterating over the list xs in reverse order and inserting and removing elements at specified indices.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(xs):
    for idx in reversed(range(-len(xs)-1, -1)):
        xs.insert(idx, xs.pop(0))
    return xs
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
