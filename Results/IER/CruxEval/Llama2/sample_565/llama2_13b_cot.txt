The function f takes a string text as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string text that has the highest value in the set {a, e, i, o, u}.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "qsqgijwmmhbchoj", we need to find the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string that has the highest value in the set {a, e, i, o, u}.
The set {a, e, i, o, u} is ordered lexicographically, so the character with the highest value is "u".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "qsqgijwmmhbchoj" is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    return max(text.find(ch) for ch in 'aeiou')
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("qsqgijwmmhbchoj")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
