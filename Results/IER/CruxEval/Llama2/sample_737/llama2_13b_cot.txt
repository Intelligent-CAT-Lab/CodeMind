The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns the number of integers in the list that are decimal numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, 2, -1, -2], we need to count the number of integers in the list that are decimal numbers.
The integer 0 is a decimal number, so we need to add 1 to the count.
The integer 6 is a decimal number, so we need to add 1 to the count.
The integer 2 is a decimal number, so we need to add 1 to the count.
The integer -1 is not a decimal number, so we do not need to add anything to the count.
The integer -2 is not a decimal number, so we do not need to add anything to the count.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, 2, -1, -2] is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    counts = 0
    for i in nums:
        if str(i).isdecimal():
            if counts == 0:
                counts += 1
    return counts
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([0, 6, 2, -1, -2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
