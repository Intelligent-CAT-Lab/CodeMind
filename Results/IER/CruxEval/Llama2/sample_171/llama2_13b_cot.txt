The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 4, 1, 2, 3], we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. Determine the length of the input list, which is 5.
2. Divide the length by 2 to get the number of elements to remove from the beginning of the list. In this case, the number of elements to remove is 2.
3. Remove the first two elements from the list. The resulting list is [1, 2, 3].
4. Return the list [1, 2, 3].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 4, 1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    count = len(nums) // 2
    for _ in range(count):
        nums.pop(0)
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([3, 4, 1, 2, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
