The function f takes a string text and a character ch as input.
It returns a string that is the concatenation of the lines of text that start with the character ch,
with each line converted to lowercase.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "t\nza\na" and "t",
we need to concatenate the lines of text that start with "t" and convert them to lowercase.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "t\nza\na" and "t" is "tza\na".
<<<Output>>>
'tza\na'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, ch):
    result = []
    for line in text.splitlines():
        if len(line) > 0 and line[0] == ch:
            result.append(line.lower())
        else:
            result.append(line.upper())
    return "\n".join(result)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("t\nza\na", "t")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
