The function f takes a string and a substring as input and returns the string after removing the substring from the beginning of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '', 'A', we need to remove the substring 'A' from the beginning of the string ''.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '', 'A' is ''.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string, substring):
    while string.startswith(substring):
        string = string[len(substring):len(string)]
    return string
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('', 'A')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
