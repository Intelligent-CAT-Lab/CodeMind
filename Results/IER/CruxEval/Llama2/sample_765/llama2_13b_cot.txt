The function f takes a string text as input and returns the sum of 1 for each character in text that is a digit.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input'so456', we need to sum 1 for each character in'so456' that is a digit.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input'so456' is 10.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    return sum(1 for c in text if c.isdigit())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('so456')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
