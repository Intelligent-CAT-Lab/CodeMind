The function f takes a string as input and returns a new string.
The function f first converts the input string into a list of characters.
Then, it iterates over the list in reverse order and removes any spaces from the list.
Finally, it joins the remaining characters into a new string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input'   jcmfxv     ', we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the input string into a list of characters:
    l = list(string)

2. Iterate over the list in reverse order and remove any spaces from the list:
    for i in reversed(range(len(l))):
        if l[i]!='':
            break
        l.pop(i)

3. Join the remaining characters into a new string:
    return ''.join(l)

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input'   jcmfxv    'is 'jcmfxv'.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    l = list(string)
    for i in reversed(range(len(l))):
        if l[i]!='':
            break
        l.pop(i)
    return ''.join(l)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('    jcmfxv     ')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
