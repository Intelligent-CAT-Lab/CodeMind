The function f takes two arguments: original, a dictionary, and string, a dictionary.
The function f creates a new dictionary by copying the values from the original dictionary and then updating the values in the new dictionary based on the values in the string dictionary.
The function f returns the new dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {1: -9, 0: -7} and {1: 2, 0: 3}, we need to copy the values from the original dictionary and then update the values in the new dictionary based on the values in the string dictionary.
The original dictionary has the values {1: -9, 0: -7}.
The string dictionary has the values {1: 2, 0: 3}.
Therefore, the new dictionary has the values {1: 2, 0: 3}.

The function f returns the new dictionary, which has the values {1: 2, 0: 3}.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(original, string):
    temp = dict(original)
    for a, b in string.items():
        temp[b] = a
    return temp
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({1: -9, 0: -7}, {1: 2, 0: 3})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
