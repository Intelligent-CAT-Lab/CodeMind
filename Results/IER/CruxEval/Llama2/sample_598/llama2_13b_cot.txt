The function f takes a string text and an integer n as input.
The function returns a substring of text that is n characters long.
The substring is taken from the end of the string text.
The substring starts at the character that is n%4 characters from the end of the string text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'abc' and n=1, we need to take a substring of 'abc' that is 1 characters long.
The substring starts at the character that is 1%4 characters from the end of 'abc'.
This is the last character of 'abc', which is 'c'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'abc' and n=1 is 'c'.
<<<Output>>>
'c'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, n):
    length = len(text)
    return text[length*(n%4):length ]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('abc', 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'abc' and n=2, we need to take a substring of 'abc' that is 2 characters long.
The substring starts at the character that is 2%4 characters from the end of 'abc'.
This is the second-to-last character of 'abc', which is 'b'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'abc' and n=2 is 'b'.
