The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The function f iterates through the array and updates the new array based on the value of the previous element.
If the current element is different from the previous element, the new array is updated with the current element.
If the current element is the same as the previous element, the current element is removed from the new array.
The function f returns the new array.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    prev = array[0]
    newArray = array[:]
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        if prev!= array[i]:
            newArray[i] = array[i]
        else:
            del newArray[i]
        prev = array[i]
    return newArray
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
