The function f takes two arguments, an array arr1 and a list arr2.
The function creates a copy of the array arr1 and then extends it with the elements of the list arr2.
The function then returns the extended array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input arrays, we need to create a copy of the array [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] and then extend it with the elements of the list ['', 0, -1, []].
The resulting array would be [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(arr1, arr2):
    new_arr = arr1.copy()
    new_arr.extend(arr2)
    return new_arr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, 1, 3, 7, 8], ['', 0, -1, []])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
