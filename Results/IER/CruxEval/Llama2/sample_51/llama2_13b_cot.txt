The function f takes an integer num as input and returns a string.
The function f first checks if num is even. If it is, it returns the string "<" repeated 10 times.
If num is odd, it returns num - 1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 21, we need to check if 21 is even.
If it is, we return the string "<" repeated 10 times.
If it is odd, we return 21 - 1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 21 is "<" repeated 10 times.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = '<' * 10
def f(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return s
    else:
        return num - 1
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(21)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
