The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns a tuple containing two values:

1. A boolean value indicating whether the two copies of the dictionary are equal.
2. A boolean value indicating whether the two copies of the dictionary are the same object.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input { 'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets' }, we need to compare the two copies of the dictionary.

The first copy of the dictionary is { 'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets' }.
The second copy of the dictionary is { 'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets' }.

Since the two copies of the dictionary are the same object, the first value of the tuple returned by the function f is True.

Since the two copies of the dictionary are not equal, the second value of the tuple returned by the function f is False.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input { 'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets' } is (True, False).

(True, False)

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
