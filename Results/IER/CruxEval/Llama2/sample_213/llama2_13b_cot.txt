The function f takes a string s as input and returns the string s with all parentheses replaced with square brackets.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "(ac)", we need to replace all parentheses with square brackets.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "(ac)" is "[ac]".
<<<Output>>>
'[ac]'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s.replace('(', '[').replace(')', ']')
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("(ac)")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
