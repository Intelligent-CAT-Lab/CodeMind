The function f takes a string as input and returns a new string that has been modified by replacing all instances of the character ':' with an empty string, with the number of replacements equal to the number of occurrences of ':' in the input string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '1::1', we need to count the number of occurrences of ':' in the input string and then replace all instances of ':' with an empty string, with the number of replacements equal to the number of occurrences of ':' in the input string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '1::1' is '11'.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    count = string.count(':')
    return string.replace(':', '', count - 1)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('1::1')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
