The function f takes a list lst and a boolean mode as input.
The function returns a list result, which is a copy of the list lst.
If mode is True, the list result is reversed.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] and mode 1, we need to reverse the list [1, 2, 3, 4] if mode is True.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] and mode 1 is [4, 3, 2, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 3, 2, 1]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst, mode):
    result = [el for el in lst]
    if mode:
        result.reverse()
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3, 4], 0)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The function returns a list result, which is a copy of the list lst.
If mode is True, the list result is reversed.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] and mode 0, we need to reverse the list [1, 2, 3, 4] if mode is True.
However, since mode is False, the list result is not reversed.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] and mode 0 is [1, 2, 3, 4].
