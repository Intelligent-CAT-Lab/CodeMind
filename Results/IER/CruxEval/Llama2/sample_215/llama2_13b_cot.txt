The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string.
The function f starts by creating a new string new_text that is equal to the input text.
Then, the function f checks if the length of the input text is greater than 1 and if the first and last characters of the input text are the same.
If this is the case, the function f removes the first and last characters of the input text and assigns the new string to the variable text.
This process is repeated until the input text is no longer longer than 1 or the first and last characters of the input text are not the same.

In this case, the input text is ')' and the first and last characters are the same.
Therefore, the function f removes the first and last characters of the input text and assigns the new string to the variable text.
This process is repeated until the input text is no longer longer than 1 or the first and last characters of the input text are not the same.

In this case, the input text is ')' and the first and last characters are the same.
Therefore, the function f removes the first and last characters of the input text and assigns the new string to the variable text.
This process is repeated until the input text is no longer longer than 1 or the first and last characters of the input text are not the same.

In this case, the input text is ')' and the first and last characters are the same.
