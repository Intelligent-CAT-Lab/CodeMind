The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns a string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [['Marie','Nelson','Oscar']], we need to concatenate the string "+" with the string "353" and then append it to the beginning of each string in the list.
We then need to join the resulting list of strings using the ";" character and then join the resulting list of strings using the "." character.
Finally, we need to return the resulting string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [['Marie','Nelson','Oscar']] is "+353Marie;+353Nelson;+353Oscar".
<<<Output>>>
"+353Marie;+353Nelson;+353Oscar"

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
