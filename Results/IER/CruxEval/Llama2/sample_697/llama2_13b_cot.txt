The function f takes two inputs: a string s and a separator sep.
The function returns three strings: a prefix, a middle, and a right string.
The prefix is the part of the input string s before the separator sep is found.
The middle is the separator sep itself.
The right string is the part of the input string s after the separator sep is found.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "not it" and the separator "", we need to find the index of the separator "" in the input string "not it".
The index of the separator "" in the input string "not it" is 0.
Therefore, the prefix is "not", the middle is "", and the right string is "it".
<<<Output>>>
('not', '', 'it')

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, sep):
    sep_index = s.find(sep)
    prefix = s[:sep_index]
    middle = s[sep_index:sep_index + len(sep)]
    right_str = s[sep_index + len(sep):]
    return prefix, middle, right_str
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("not it", " ")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
