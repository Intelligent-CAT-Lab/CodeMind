The function f takes a string text and an integer width as input.
The function f returns a string that is the concatenation of the lines of text, each line centered on the width.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "l\nl" and width 2, we need to concatenate the lines of text, each line centered on the width.

The first line of text is "l\nl".
The width is 2.
Therefore, the first line of text is centered on the width.
The second line of text is "l".
The width is 2.
Therefore, the second line of text is centered on the width.

The output of executing the function f on the input "l\nl" and width 2 is "l\nl\nl".
<<<Output>>>
'l\nl\nl'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, width):
    result = ""
    lines = text.split('\n')
    for l in lines:
        result += l.center(width)
        result += '\n'

    # Remove the very last empty line
    result = result[:-1]
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('l\nl', 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
