The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41", we need to split the input string into a list of words, remove any leading or trailing whitespace, and then join the words back together with a space between each one.
We can then check if any of the words are numeric and return a dash if they are not.

The output of executing the function f on the input "d khqw whi fwi bbn 41" is "-".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    a = text.strip().split(' ')
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i].isdigit() is False:
            return '-'
    return " ".join(a)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("d khqw whi fwi bbn 41")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
