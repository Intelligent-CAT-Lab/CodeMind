The function f takes a string doc as input and returns the capitalized version of the first letter of each word in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'raruwa', we need to iterate over the characters in the string and capitalize the first letter of each word.
The string 'raruwa' contains two words, 'ra' and 'ruwa'.
The first letter of 'ra' is 'r', which is not a letter, so we return '-'.
The first letter of 'ruwa' is 'r', which is a letter, so we return 'R'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'raruwa' is 'R'.
<<<Output>>>
'R'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(doc):
    for x in doc:
        if x.isalpha():
            return x.capitalize()
    return '-'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('raruwa')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
