The function f takes a string n as input and returns the value of n after processing it.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "6 ** 2", we need to process the string "6 ** 2" by iterating over the characters in the string.
For each character in the string, we check if it is a digit.
If it is not a digit, we set the value of n to -1 and break out of the loop.
If we reach the end of the loop without setting n to -1, we return the value of n.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "6 ** 2" is 36.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    for i in str(n):
        if not i.isdigit():
            n = -1
            break
    return n
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("6 ** 2")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
