The function f takes a string text as input and returns the number of numeric characters in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Thisisastring", we need to count the number of numeric characters in the string.
The string "Thisisastring" contains two numeric characters, "1" and "2", so the output of executing the function f on the input "Thisisastring" is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    number = 0
    for t in text:
        if t.isnumeric():
            number += 1
    return number
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Thisisastring')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
