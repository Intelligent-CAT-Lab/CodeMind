The function f takes two inputs: a list of integers nums and an integer number.
It returns the number of times the integer number appears in the list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs [12, 0, 13, 4, 12] and 12, we need to count the number of times the integer 12 appears in the list [12, 0, 13, 4, 12].
There are two occurrences of 12 in the list, so the output of executing the function f on the inputs [12, 0, 13, 4, 12] and 12 is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, number):
    return nums.count(number)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([12, 0, 13, 4, 12], 12)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
