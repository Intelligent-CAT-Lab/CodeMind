The function f takes three inputs: a list of integers nums, two integers odd1 and odd2.
The function f removes the integers odd1 and odd2 from the list nums.
The function f returns the list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3], 3, 1), we need to remove the integers 3 and 1 from the list [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3], 3, 1) is [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.
