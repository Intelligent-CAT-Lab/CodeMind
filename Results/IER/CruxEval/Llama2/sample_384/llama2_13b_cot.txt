The function f takes a string text and a list of characters chars as input.
The function f converts the input text and chars to lists.
The function f then iterates over the list new_text, which is a copy of the input text, while the input text is not empty.
For each iteration, the function f checks if the first character of new_text is in the list of characters chars.
If the first character of new_text is in the list of characters chars, the function f removes the first character of new_text from the list.
Otherwise, the function f breaks out of the loop.
The function f then returns the string that is the result of joining the characters in the list new_text.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, chars):
    chars = list(chars)
    text = list(text)
    new_text = text
    while len(new_text) > 0 and text:
        if new_text[0] in chars:
            new_text = new_text[1:]
        else:
            break 
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('asfdellos', 'Ta')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
