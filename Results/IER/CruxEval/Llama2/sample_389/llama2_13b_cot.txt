The function f takes two arguments: a list total and a list or string arg.
If the type of arg is a list, the function iterates over the elements of arg and extends the list total with each element.
If the type of arg is a string, the function extends the list total with the string arg.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], 'nammo', we need to iterate over the elements of the list 'nammo' and extend the list total with each element.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], 'nammo' is [1, 2, 3, 'n', 'a','m','m', 'o'].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 'n', 'a','m','m', 'o']

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
