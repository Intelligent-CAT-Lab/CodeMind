The function f takes a string text as input and returns the length of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "mrq7y", we need to calculate the length of the string "mrq7y".
The length of the string "mrq7y" is 6.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    result_list = ['3', '3', '3', '3']
    if result_list:
        result_list.clear()
    return len(text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("mrq7y")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
