The function f takes a string st as input and returns a string that is the result of reversing the characters of st and then swapping each character to uppercase.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "RTiGM", we need to reverse the characters of "RTiGM" and then swap each character to uppercase.
This results in the string "GMTiR".

'GMTiR'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(st):
    swapped = ''
    for ch in reversed(st):
        swapped += ch.swapcase()
    return swapped
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('RTiGM')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
