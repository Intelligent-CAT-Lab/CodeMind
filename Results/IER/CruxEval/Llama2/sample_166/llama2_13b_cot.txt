The function f takes a dictionary graph as input and returns a new dictionary.
The function f iterates over the keys and values of the input dictionary graph and creates a new dictionary with the same keys and values.
For each key in the input dictionary, the function f creates a new dictionary with the same key and an empty value.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input dictionary {} is a dictionary with the same keys and values as the input dictionary.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(graph):
    new_graph = {}
    for key, value in graph.items():
        new_graph[key] = {}
        for subkey in value:
            new_graph[key][subkey] = ''
    return new_graph
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({"a": ["b", "c"]})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
