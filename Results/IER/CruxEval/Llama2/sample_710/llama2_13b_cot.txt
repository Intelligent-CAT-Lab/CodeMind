    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(playlist, liker_name, song_index):
    playlist[liker_name] = playlist.get(liker_name, [])
    playlist[liker_name].append(song_index)
    return playlist
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'aki': ['1', '5']}, 'aki', '2')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
