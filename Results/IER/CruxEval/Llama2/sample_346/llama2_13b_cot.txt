The function f takes a filename as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the filename ends with the suffix of the filename.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'docs.doc', we need to split the filename into its components and then check whether the suffix of the filename ends with the suffix of the filename.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'docs.doc' is True.
<<<Output>>>
True

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(filename):
    suffix = filename.split('.')[-1]
    f2 = filename + suffix[::-1]
    return f2.endswith(suffix)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('docs.doc')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
