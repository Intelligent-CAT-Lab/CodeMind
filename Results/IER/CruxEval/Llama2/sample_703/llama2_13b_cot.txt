The function f takes a string text and a character char as input.
The function returns the substring of text that starts at the index count, where count is the number of occurrences of char*2 in text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'vzzv2sg' and 'z', we need to find the number of occurrences of 'zz' in 'vzzv2sg'.
This can be done by using the string method count, which returns the number of occurrences of a given substring in a string.

We can then use the substring method to extract the substring of 'vzzv2sg' that starts at the index count, where count is the number of occurrences of 'zz' in 'vzzv2sg'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'vzzv2sg' and 'z' is 'v2sg'.
<<<Output>>>
'v2sg'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    count = text.count(char*2)
    return text[count:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('vzzv2sg', 'z')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
