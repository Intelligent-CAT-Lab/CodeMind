The function f takes a string text as input and returns the sum of the lengths of the two strings that are split from the input string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'dog,cat', we need to split the input string into two strings, 'dog' and 'cat'.
Then, we need to calculate the sum of the lengths of these two strings.
The length of 'dog' is 3, and the length of 'cat' is 4.
Therefore, the sum of the lengths of these two strings is 7.
Finally, we need to subtract this sum from the length of the input string, which is 10.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'dog,cat' is -3.
<<<Output>>>
-3

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    string_a, string_b = text.split(',')
    return -(len(string_a) + (len(string_b)))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('dog,cat')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
