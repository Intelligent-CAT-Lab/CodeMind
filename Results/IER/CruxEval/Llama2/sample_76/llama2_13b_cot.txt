The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of numbers.
The function f first creates a new list nums by removing any negative numbers from the input list.
Then, if the length of the new list nums is less than or equal to 3, the function f returns the new list nums.
Otherwise, the function f reverses the order of the elements in the new list nums and then splits the list into two halves.
The first half of the list is returned, followed by a list of 5 zeros, and then the second half of the list is returned.
<<<Output>>>
[10, 3, 2, 2, 6, 0]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    nums = [y for y in nums if y > 0]
    if len(nums) <= 3:
        return nums
    nums.reverse()
    half = len(nums)//2
    return nums[:half] + [0]*5 + nums[half:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([10, 3, 2, 2, 6, 0])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
