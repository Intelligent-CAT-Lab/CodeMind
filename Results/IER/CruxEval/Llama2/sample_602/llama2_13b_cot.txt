The function f takes two inputs: a list of integers nums and an integer target.
The function returns the number of times the integer target appears in the list nums, multiplied by 2.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs [1, 1] and 1, we need to count the number of times the integer 1 appears in the list [1, 1] and multiply that number by 2.

The integer 1 appears once in the list [1, 1], so the output of executing the function f on the inputs [1, 1] and 1 is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, target):
    cnt = nums.count(target)
    return cnt * 2
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 1], 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
