The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The function f first creates a copy of the input array and then modifies the copy.
The function f modifies the copy by swapping the first and last elements of the copy.
The function f then reverses the copy.

Therefore, the return value of the function f on the input array [] is [].
<<<Output>>>
[]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    output = array.copy()
    output[0::2] = output[-1::-2]
    output.reverse()
    return output
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
