The function f takes a string text and a list of characters characters as input.
The function f creates a list of characters that includes the characters in the list characters, as well as the characters " " (space) and "_" (underscore).
The function f then creates an integer i that is initialized to 0.
The function f then loops while i is less than the length of the string text and the character at index i in text is in the list of characters.
In this case, the character at index i in text is in the list of characters, so the loop continues.
The function f then increments i by 1.
The function f then returns the substring of text that starts at index i and ends at the end of the string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "2nm_28in" and the list of characters "nm" is "28in".
<<<Output>>>
'28in'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, characters):
    character_list = list(characters) + [' ', '_']

    i = 0
    while i < len(text) and text[i] in character_list:
        i += 1

    return text[i:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("2nm_28in", "nm")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
