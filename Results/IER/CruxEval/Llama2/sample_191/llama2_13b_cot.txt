The function f takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is all uppercase.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Ohno", we need to check if the string is all uppercase.
The string "Ohno" is not all uppercase, as it contains the lowercase letter "o".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "Ohno" is False.
<<<Output>>>
False

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    if string.isupper():
        return True
    else:
        return False
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Ohno')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
