The function f takes an array as input and returns the array after performing the following operations:

1. The length of the array is reduced by 1, and the resulting length is divided by 3.
2. For each element in the array, the value is set to '0'.
3. For each element in the array, the values are set to ['0', '0', '0'].

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [9, 2], we need to perform the following steps:

1. The length of the array is reduced by 1, and the resulting length is divided by 3.
    - The length of the array is reduced by 1, so the new length is 2.
    - The new length is divided by 3, so the new length is 1.
2. For each element in the array, the value is set to '0'.
    - The first element is set to '0'.
    - The second element is set to '0'.
3. For each element in the array, the values are set to ['0', '0', '0'].
    - The first element is set to ['0', '0', '0'].
    - The second element is set to ['0', '0', '0'].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [9, 2] is ['0', '0', '0'].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    zero_len = (len(array) - 1) % 3
    for i in range(zero_len):
        array[i] = '0'
    for i in range(zero_len + 1, len(array), 3):
        array[i - 1:i + 2] = ['0', '0', '0']
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([9, 2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
