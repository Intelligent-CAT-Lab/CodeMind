The function f takes a string text and an integer tabstop as input.
The function f replaces all newline characters in the string text with "_____" and replaces all tab characters with tabstop spaces.
It then replaces all "_____" characters with newline characters.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "odes\tcode\twell" and tabstop 2, we need to replace all newline characters in the input with "_____" and replace all tab characters with 2 spaces.
We then need to replace all "_____" characters with newline characters.

The output of executing the function f on the input "odes\tcode\twell" and tabstop 2 is:

odes   code   well

<<<Output>>>
'odes   code   well'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, tabstop):
    text = text.replace('\n', '_____')
    text = text.replace('\t', tabstop *'')
    text = text.replace('_____', '\n')
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("odes\tcode\twell", 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
