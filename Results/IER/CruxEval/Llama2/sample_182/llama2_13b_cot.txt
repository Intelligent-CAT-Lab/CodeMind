The function f takes a dictionary dic as input and returns a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair from the dictionary.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {b: 1, a: 2}, we need to sort the key-value pairs in the dictionary by the keys.
The keys are the strings "b" and "a", so we can sort them lexicographically.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {b: 1, a: 2} is [(b, 1), (a, 2)].
<<<Output>>>
[(b, 1), (a, 2)]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(dic):
    return sorted(dic.items(), key=lambda x: x[0])
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'b': 1, 'a': 2})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
