The function f takes a list lst as input and returns the list after performing the following operations:

1. Reversing the list
2. Popping the last element of the list
3. Reversing the list again

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 8, 2, 8], we need to perform the following steps:

1. Reverse the list [7, 8, 2, 8] to get the list [8, 2, 7, 8].
2. Pop the last element of the list [8, 2, 7, 8] to get the list [8, 2, 7].
3. Reverse the list [8, 2, 7] to get the list [7, 2, 8].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 8, 2, 8] is [7, 2, 8].

[7, 2, 8]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    lst.reverse()
    lst.pop()
    lst.reverse()
    return lst
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([7, 8, 2, 8])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
