The function f takes two arguments: a list of values and a value.
The function f returns a dictionary where the keys are the values in the list and the values are the value passed in as an argument.
The function f also creates a new key in the dictionary, which is the concatenation of the values in the list sorted alphabetically.
The value for this new key is the value passed in as an argument multiplied by 3.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['0','3'], 117, we need to create a dictionary where the keys are the values in the list ['0','3'] and the values are 117.
We also need to create a new key in the dictionary, which is the concatenation of the values in the list sorted alphabetically.
The value for this new key is 117 multiplied by 3.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['0','3'], 117 is a dictionary where the keys are ['0','3'] and the values are 117.
The new key in the dictionary is '03' and its value is 351.
<<<Output>>>
{'0': 117, '3': 117, '03': 351}

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(values, value):
    length = len(values)
    new_dict = dict.fromkeys(values, value)
    new_dict[''.join(sorted(values))] = value * 3
    return new_dict
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['0','3'], 117)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
