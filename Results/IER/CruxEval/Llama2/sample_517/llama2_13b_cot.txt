The function f takes a string text as input and returns the substring of text that starts at the first character and ends at the first character that is not uppercase.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "SzHjifnzog", we need to find the first character that is not uppercase.
The first character that is not uppercase is "z".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "SzHjifnzog" is "SzHjifnz".
<<<Output>>>
'SzHjifnz'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    for i in range(len(text)-1, 0, -1):
        if not text[i].isupper():
            return text[0:i]
    return ''
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('SzHjifnzog')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
