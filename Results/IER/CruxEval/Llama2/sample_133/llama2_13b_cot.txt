The function f takes two arguments: a list of integers nums and a list of integers elements.
The function f returns a list of integers.

The function f iterates over the list elements and for each element, it removes the corresponding element from the list nums.
The function f then returns the list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2] and [9, 0, 3], we need to iterate over the list elements and for each element, remove the corresponding element from the list nums.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2] and [9, 0, 3] is [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
