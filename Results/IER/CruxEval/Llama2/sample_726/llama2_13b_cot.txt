The function f takes a string text as input and returns two values: the number of whitespace characters in the string and the length of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds", we need to count the number of whitespace characters in the string and the length of the string.

The string "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds" contains 1 whitespace character (" "), so the number of whitespace characters in the string is 1.
The length of the string is 30, so the length of the string is 30.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds" is (1, 30).
<<<Output>>>
(1, 30)

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    ws = 0
    for s in text:
        if s.isspace():
            ws += 1
    return ws, len(text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
