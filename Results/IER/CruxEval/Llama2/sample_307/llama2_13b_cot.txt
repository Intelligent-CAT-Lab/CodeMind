The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string that is created by inserting the character '|' between each pair of adjacent characters in the input string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'pxcznyf', we need to insert the character '|' between each pair of adjacent characters in the input string.

The output of executing the function f on the input 'pxcznyf' is 'p|xcz|ny|f'.
<<<Output>>>
'p|xcz|ny|f'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    rtext = list(text)
    for i in range(1, len(rtext) - 1):
        rtext.insert(i + 1, '|')
    return ''.join(rtext)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('pxcznyf')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
