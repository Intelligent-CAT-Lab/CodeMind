The function f takes two strings a and b as input and returns a tuple containing the strings b and a if a is less than b, or a tuple containing the strings a and b otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input'ml' and'mv', we need to compare the strings'ml' and'mv' to determine which is less than the other.
If'ml' is less than'mv', then the output of executing the function f on the input'ml' and'mv' is the tuple containing the strings'mv' and'ml'.
If'ml' is not less than'mv', then the output of executing the function f on the input'ml' and'mv' is the tuple containing the strings'ml' and'mv'.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b):
    if a < b:
        return (b, a)
    return (a, b)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ml','mv')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
