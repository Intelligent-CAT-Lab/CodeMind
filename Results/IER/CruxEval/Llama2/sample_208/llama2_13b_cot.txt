The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of the characters in each string that are not digits.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['123', 'cat', 'd dee'], we need to iterate over each item in the input list and for each item, iterate over each character in the item and append the character to the result list if it is not a digit.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['123', 'cat', 'd dee'] is ['a', 'c', 't', 'd', 'e'].
<<<Output>>>
['a', 'c', 't', 'd', 'e']

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        for d in item:
            if not d.isdigit():
                result.append(d)
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['123', 'cat', 'd dee'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
