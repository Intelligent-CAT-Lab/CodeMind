The function f takes three arguments: text, sep, and num.
The text argument is a string that is passed as input to the function.
The sep argument is a string that is used to split the text argument into a list of substrings.
The num argument is an integer that specifies the number of times the text argument should be split.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'aa+++bb', sep = '+', and num = 1, we need to split the input string 'aa+++bb' into a list of substrings using the separator '+'.
We then need to join the list of substrings using three underscores ('___') to create a new string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'aa+++bb', sep = '+', and num = 1 is '___aa___bb'.
<<<Output>>>
'___aa___bb'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, sep, num):
    return '___'.join(text.rsplit(sep, num))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('aa+++bb', '+', 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
