The function f takes a string st as input and returns either "Hey" or "Hi" depending on the position of the letter "h" in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Hi there", we need to check the position of the letter "h" in the string.
If the position of the letter "h" in the string is greater than or equal to the position of the letter "i" in the string, then the output of executing the function f on the input "Hi there" is "Hey".
Otherwise, the output of executing the function f on the input "Hi there" is "Hi".
<<<Output>>>
'Hey'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(st):
    if st.lower().rindex('h', st.lower().rindex('i')) >= st.lower().rindex('i'):
        return 'Hey'
    else:
        return 'Hi'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Hi there')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
