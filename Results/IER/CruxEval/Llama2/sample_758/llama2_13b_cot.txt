The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in reverse order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 3, 6, 2], we need to check if the list is sorted in reverse order.
To do this, we need to compare the list with its reverse order.
We can create the reverse order of the list by using the slice operator [::-1].
We can then compare the list with its reverse order using the equality operator ==.
If the list is sorted in reverse order, the comparison will be true, and the function will return True.
If the list is not sorted in reverse order, the comparison will be false, and the function will return False.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 3, 6, 2] is True.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    if nums[::-1] == nums:
        return True
    return False
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([0, 3, 6, 2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
