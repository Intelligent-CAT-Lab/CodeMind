The function f takes an array as input and returns the array after removing all negative elements from it.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [], we need to remove all negative elements from the empty array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [] is [].
<<<Output>>>
[]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    for i in range(len(array)):
        if array[i] < 0:
            array.pop(i)
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3, -4, -5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes an array as input and returns the array after removing all negative elements from it.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, -4, -5], we need to remove all negative elements from the array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, -4, -5] is [1, 2, 3].

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3, -4, -5, -6])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
