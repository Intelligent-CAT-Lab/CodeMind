The function f takes a string text as input and returns the string after removing the last digit of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "25000   $", we need to remove the last digit of the string.
The last digit of the string "25000   $" is "0".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "25000   $" is "25000   $".
<<<Output>>>
'25000   $'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    for i in range(10, 0, -1):
        text = text.lstrip(str(i))
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("25000   $")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
