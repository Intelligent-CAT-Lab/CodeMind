The function f takes a string name as input and returns the concatenation of the string name with the string "*".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Fred Smith", we need to concatenate "Fred Smith" with "*".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "Fred Smith" is "*Fred Smith*".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(name):
    return '*'.join(name.split(' '))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Fred Smith')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
