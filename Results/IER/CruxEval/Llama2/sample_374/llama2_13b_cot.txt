The function f takes a list of strings seq and a string v as input.
It creates an empty list a and iterates over the elements of seq.
For each element i in seq, it checks if i ends with v.
If it does, it appends i multiplied by 2 to a.
Finally, it returns a.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(seq, v):
    a = []
    for i in seq:
        if i.endswith(v):
            a.append(i*2)
    return a
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([ 'oH', 'ee','mb', 'deft', 'n', 'zz', 'f', 'abA' ], 'zz')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
