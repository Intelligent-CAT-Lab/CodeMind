The function f takes a list lst as input and returns True if the list contains the number 3, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 0], we need to check if the list contains the number 3.
Since the list does not contain the number 3, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    lst.clear()
    for i in lst:
        if i == 3:
            return False
    else:
        return True
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([2, 0])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
