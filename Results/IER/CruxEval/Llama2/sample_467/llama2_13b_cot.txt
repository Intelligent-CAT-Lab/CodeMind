The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns a dictionary of the lengths of each string in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {}, we need to create a copy of the empty list and iterate over each element in the copy.
For each element, we need to create a new dictionary with the key being the element and the value being the length of the element.
Finally, we return the dictionary.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    copy = nums.copy()
    newDict = dict()
    for k in copy:
        newDict[k] = len(copy[k])
    return newDict
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
