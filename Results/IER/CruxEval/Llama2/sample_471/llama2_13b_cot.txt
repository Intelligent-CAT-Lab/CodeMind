The function f takes two inputs: a string val and a string text.
The function returns the index of the first occurrence of the string val in the string text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs "o" and "fnmart", we need to find the index of the first occurrence of the string "o" in the string "fnmart".

The string "fnmart" contains the string "o" at the index 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs "o" and "fnmart" is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(val, text):
    indices = [index for index in range(len(text)) if text[index] == val]
    if len(indices) == 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return indices[0]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('o', 'fnmart')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
