The function f takes two inputs: a list of integers nums and an integer target.
The function returns two lists: a list of integers lows and a list of integers higgs.

The function iterates through the list of integers nums and appends each integer to either the list lows or the list higgs based on whether the integer is less than or greater than the integer target.

The function then clears the list lows.

The return value of the function is the list lows.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, target):
    lows, higgs = [], []
    for i in nums:
        if i < target:
            lows.append(i)
        else:
            higgs.append(i)
    lows.clear()
    return lows, higgs
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
