The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers.
The function f first calculates the length of the input list, which is 8.
Then, the function f iterates through the input list and removes any elements that are not divisible by 2.
This process is repeated until the length of the input list is equal to the length of the output list divided by 2.
In this case, the length of the output list is 4, so the process is repeated until the length of the input list is 2.
Finally, the function f returns the input list.

Therefore, the return value of the function f on the input list [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 3, 8] is [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 3, 8].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    count = len(nums)
    while len(nums) > (count//2):
        nums.clear()
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 3, 8])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
