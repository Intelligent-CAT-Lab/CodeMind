The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers.
The function f first finds the middle index of the input list by dividing the length of the list by 2.
Then, the function f returns the second half of the input list followed by the first half of the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1], we need to find the middle index of the input list.
The middle index of the input list is 1, since the length of the input list is 3 and 3//2 = 1.

Then, the function f returns the second half of the input list followed by the first half of the input list.
The second half of the input list is [1, 1], and the first half of the input list is [1].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1] is [1, 1, 1].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    middle = len(nums)//2
    return nums[middle:] + nums[0:middle]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 1, 1])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
