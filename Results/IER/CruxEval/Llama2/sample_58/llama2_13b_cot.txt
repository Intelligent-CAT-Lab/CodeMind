The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list of integers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1], we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. Get the length of the input list, which is 5.
2. For each element in the input list, check if it is even or odd. If it is even, append it to the output list.
3. Return the output list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] is [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
