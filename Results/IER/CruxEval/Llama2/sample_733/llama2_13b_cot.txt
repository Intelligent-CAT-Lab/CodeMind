The function f takes a string text as input and returns the concatenation of the left half of the string and the right half of the string, reversed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'n', we need to split the string 'n' into its left half and right half.
The left half of the string 'n' is 'n', and the right half of the string 'n' is ''.
The left half of the string 'n' is 'n', and the right half of the string 'n' is ''.
