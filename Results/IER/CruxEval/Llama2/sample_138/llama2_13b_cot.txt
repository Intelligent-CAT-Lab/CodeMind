The function f takes a string text and a list of characters chars as input.
The function f first removes the first character from the list of characters and stores it in a variable called first.
Then, the function f iterates over the remaining characters in the list of characters and replaces each character in the string text with the character from the list of characters.
The function f returns the modified string text.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, chars):
    listchars = list(chars)
    first = listchars.pop()
    for i in listchars:
        text = text[0:text.find(i)]+i+text[text.find(i)+1:]
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('tflb omn rtt','m')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
