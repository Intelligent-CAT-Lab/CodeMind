The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list of integers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 3], we need to iterate through the input list and append each element to the output list if it is divisible by 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 3] is [1, 3, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 1]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] % 3 == 0:
            nums.append(nums[i])
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
