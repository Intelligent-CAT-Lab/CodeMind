The function f takes a string text and a list of characters to strip as input.
It returns the reversed string text with the characters in strip_chars removed.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "tcmfsmj" and strip_chars "cfj", we need to reverse the string "tcmfsmj" and remove the characters "cfj" from it.
Then, we need to reverse the resulting string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "tcmfsmj" and strip_chars "cfj" is "jfmsctm".
<<<Output>>>
'jfmsctm'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, strip_chars):
    return text[::-1].strip(strip_chars)[::-1]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('tcmfsmj', 'cfj')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
