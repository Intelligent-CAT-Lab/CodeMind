The function f takes a string text and a function function as input.
It returns a list of integers representing the number of characters in the substring of text that starts at the index of function in text and ends at the end of the string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "010100" and "010", we need to find the number of characters in the substring of "010100" that starts at the index of "010" in "010100" and ends at the end of the string.

The substring of "010100" that starts at the index of "010" in "010100" and ends at the end of the string is "010".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "010100" and "010" is [2].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, function):
    cites = [len(text[text.index(function) + len(function):])]
    for char in text:
        if char == function:
            cites.append(len(text[text.index(function) + len(function):]))
    return cites
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("010100", "010")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
