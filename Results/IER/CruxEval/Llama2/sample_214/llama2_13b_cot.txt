The function f takes a string sample as input and returns the index of the last '/' character in the string before the index i.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'present/here/car%2Fwe', we need to find the index of the last '/' character in the string before the index -1.
The index of the last '/' character in the string before the index -1 is 10.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'present/here/car%2Fwe' is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(sample):
    i = -1
    while sample.find('/', i+1)!= -1:
        i = sample.find('/', i+1)
    return sample.rindex('/', 0, i)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('present/here/car%2Fwe')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
