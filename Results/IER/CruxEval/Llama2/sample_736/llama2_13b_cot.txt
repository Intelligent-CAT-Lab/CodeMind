The function f takes a string text and a string insert as input and returns a string.
The function f iterates through each character in the string text and performs the following steps:

1. If the character is a whitespace character, the function f inserts the string insert into the output string.
2. If the character is not a whitespace character, the function f appends the character to the output string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'pi wa' and insert 'chi', we need to iterate through each character in the string 'pi wa' and perform the following steps:

1. If the character is a whitespace character, the function f inserts the string 'chi' into the output string.
2. If the character is not a whitespace character, the function f appends the character to the output string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'pi wa' and insert 'chi' is 'pichi wa'.
<<<Output>>>
'pichi wa'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, insert):
    whitespaces = {'\t', '\r', '\v','', '\f', '\n'}
    clean = ''
    for char in text:
        if char in whitespaces:
            clean += insert
        else:
            clean += char
    return clean
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('pi wa', 'chi')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
