The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string.
The function f first converts the input string into a list of characters.
Then, it iterates over the character '+' and removes any instances of '+' from the list.
Finally, it joins the remaining characters into a single string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'hbtofdeiequ', we need to convert the input into a list of characters, iterate over the character '+', and remove any instances of '+' from the list.
Then, we need to join the remaining characters into a single string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'hbtofdeiequ' is 'htofdeiequ'.
<<<Output>>>
'htofdeiequ'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    new_text = list(text)
    for i in '+':
        if i in new_text:
            new_text.remove(i)
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('hbtofdeiequ')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
