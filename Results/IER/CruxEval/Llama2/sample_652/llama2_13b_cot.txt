The function f takes a string as input and returns a string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '3', we need to follow the steps below:

1. Check if the input is not empty and if the first character is not a number.
2. Initialize a variable cur to 0.
3. For each character in the input, multiply cur by 10 and add the value of the character to cur.
4. Return the string representation of cur.

Based on the above steps, the output of executing the function f on the input '3' is '3'.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    if not string or not string[0].isnumeric:
        return 'INVALID'
    cur = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        cur = cur * 10 + int(string[i])
    return str(cur)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('3')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
