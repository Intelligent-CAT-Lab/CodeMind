The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns a dictionary of the number of occurrences of each string in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ["La", "Q", "9", "La", "La"], we need to count the number of occurrences of each string in the list.
The string "La" occurs twice, the string "Q" occurs once, and the string "9" occurs once.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ["La", "Q", "9", "La", "La"] is { "La": 2, "Q": 1, "9": 1 }.
<<<Output>>>
{ "La": 2, "Q": 1, "9": 1 }

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(strings):
    occurances = {}
    for string in strings:
        if string not in occurances:
            occurances[string] = strings.count(string)
    return occurances
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(["La", "Q", "9", "La", "La"])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
