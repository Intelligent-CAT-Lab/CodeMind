The function f takes three arguments: text, substr, and occ.
The text argument is a string that is passed as input to the function.
The substr argument is a substring that is searched for within the text argument.
The occ argument is an integer that specifies the number of times the substring should be found within the text argument.

The function f uses a while loop to iterate through the text argument until it finds the substring substr a specified number of times.
The loop starts by finding the index of the substring in the text argument using the rfind method.
If the index is -1, it means that the substring was not found in the text argument, so the loop breaks.
If the index is not -1, the function checks if the number of times the substring has been found is equal to the occ argument.
If it is, the function returns the index of the substring in the text argument.
Otherwise, the function updates the text argument to remove the substring and decrements the number of times the substring has been found.
The function then repeats the loop until the substring is found the specified number of times.

In this case, the function is passed the string 'zjegiymjc', the substring 'j', and the integer 2.
The function will iterate through the string until it finds the substring 'j' two times.
The first time the substring is found, the function will return the index of the substring in the text argument, which is 1.
The second time the substring is found, the function will return the index of the substring in the text argument, which is 4.

Therefore, the return value of the function f on the input 'zjegiymjc', 'j', 2 is 1, 4.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, substr, occ):
    n = 0
    while True:
        i = text.rfind(substr)
        if i == -1:
            break
        elif n == occ:
            return i
        else:
            n += 1
            text = text[:i]
    return -1
