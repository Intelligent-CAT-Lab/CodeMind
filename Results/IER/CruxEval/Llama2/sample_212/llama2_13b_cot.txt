The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns the list after reversing the order of the elements.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3], we need to reverse the order of the elements in the list.
The list [1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3] becomes [3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1] after reversing the order of the elements.
The function f then returns the list [3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[3, -3, 6, 2, 7, -9, 1]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for _ in range(len(nums) - 1):
        nums.reverse()
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, -9, 7, 2, 6, -3, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
