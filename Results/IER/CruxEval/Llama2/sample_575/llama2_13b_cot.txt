The function f takes two inputs: a list of integers nums and an integer val.
The function returns the sum of the list of integers that is generated by extending each element of nums by val.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [10, 4] and val 3, we need to generate a list of integers that is 3 elements long and extend each element of nums by val.

The list of integers that is 3 elements long is [10, 10, 10].
The list of integers that is 4 elements long is [10, 10, 10, 4].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [10, 4] and val 3 is 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 34.

34

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
