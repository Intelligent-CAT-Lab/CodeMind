The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, -5, -4], we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. Get the length of the input list, which is 3.
2. Initialize a counter to 3.
3. For each iteration of the loop, we will take the first element of the input list and insert it at the end of the list.
4. We will then take the last element of the input list and remove it from the list.
5. We will then repeat steps 3 and 4 until the counter reaches 0.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, -5, -4] is [-5, -4, 0].
<<<Output>>>
[-5, -4, 0]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    count = len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
        nums.insert(i, nums.pop(0))
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([0, -5, -4])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
