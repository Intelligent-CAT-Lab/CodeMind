The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string that is the concatenation of the characters in text with the characters '+' and '*'.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'nzoh', we need to concatenate the characters in 'nzoh' with the characters '+' and '*'.
The characters in 'nzoh' are 'n', 'z', 'o', 'h'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'nzoh' is 'n+z+o+h+*'.
<<<Output>>>
'n+z+o+h+*'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    ls = list(text)
    for i in range(0, len(ls)):
        if ls[i]!='+':
            ls.insert(i, '+')
            ls.insert(i, '*')
            break
    return '+'.join(ls)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('nzoh')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
