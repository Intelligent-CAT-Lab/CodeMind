The function f takes a list lst as input and returns a new list.
The function f iterates through the list lst and appends the elements of lst to the new list in reverse order.
The function f first appends the element -1 to the new list, then appends the element -3 to the new list, then appends the element 1 to the new list, and finally appends the element 7 to the new list.
Therefore, the return value of the function f on the input [1, 7, -1, -3] is [-1, -3, 1, 7].
<<<Output>>>
[-1, -3, 1, 7]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    new = list()
    i = len(lst)-1
    for _ in range(len(lst)):
        if i%2 == 0:
            new.append(-lst[i])
        else:
            new.append(lst[i])
        i -= 1
    return new
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 7, -1, -3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
