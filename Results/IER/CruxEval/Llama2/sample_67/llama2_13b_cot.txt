The function f takes three numbers as input and returns a string representation of the numbers in sorted order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (6, 8, 8), we need to sort the numbers and then return a string representation of the sorted numbers.
The numbers are sorted in ascending order, so the output of executing the function f on the input (6, 8, 8) is "6,8,8".
<<<Output>>>
'6,8,8'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(num1, num2, num3):
    nums = [num1, num2, num3]
    nums.sort()    
    return f'{nums[0]},{nums[1]},{nums[2]}'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(6,8,8)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
