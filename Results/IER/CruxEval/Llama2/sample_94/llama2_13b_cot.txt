The function f takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary that contains the keys and values from both dictionaries.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {{'w': 5, 'wi': 10}, {'w': 3}}, we need to combine the keys and values from both dictionaries.
The keys from the first dictionary are 'w' and 'wi', and the keys from the second dictionary are also 'w'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {{'w': 5, 'wi': 10}, {'w': 3}} is {w: 8, wi: 10}.
<<<Output>>>
{w: 8, wi: 10}

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b):
    return {**a, **b}
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'w': 5, 'wi': 10}, {'w': 3})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
