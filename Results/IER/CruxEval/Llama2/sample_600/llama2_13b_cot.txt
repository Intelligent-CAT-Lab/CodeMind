The function f takes an array as input and returns a list of strings.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [], we need to create a list of strings by concatenating the string "n" repeated the number of times specified in the array.
Since the array is empty, the number of times the string "n" is repeated is 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [] is an empty list.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    just_ns = list(map(lambda num: 'n'*num, array))
    final_output = []
    for wipe in just_ns:
        final_output.append(wipe)
    return final_output
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes an array as input and returns a list of strings.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1], we need to create a list of strings by concatenating the string "n" repeated the number of times specified in the array.
Since the array is [1], the number of times the string "n" is repeated is 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1] is a list containing the string "n" repeated 1 time.
