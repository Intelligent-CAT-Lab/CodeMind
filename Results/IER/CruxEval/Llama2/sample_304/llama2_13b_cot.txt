The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns a new dictionary.
The function f first sorts the keys of the dictionary d in descending order and then returns the first key and its corresponding value.
The function f then sorts the keys of the dictionary d in descending order and then returns the second key and its corresponding value.
Finally, the function f returns a dictionary with the first key and its corresponding value as the first key and the second key and its corresponding value as the second key.

Therefore, the return value of the function f on the input {2: 3, 17: 3, 16: 6, 18: 6, 87: 7} is {18: 6, 17: 3}.
<<<Output>>>
{'18': 6, '17': 3}

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
