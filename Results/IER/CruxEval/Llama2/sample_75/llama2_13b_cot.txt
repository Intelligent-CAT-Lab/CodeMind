The function f takes two inputs: an array and an element.
The function returns the index of the element in the array multiplied by 2, plus the value of the element at the index of the element in the array multiplied by 3.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2] and element 2, we need to find the index of 2 in the array.
This index is 2, as 2 is the second element in the array.
We then need to multiply 2 by 2, which gives us 4.
We then need to take the value of the element at the index of 2 in the array, which is -8, and multiply it by 3, which gives us -24.
Finally, we need to add 4 and -24, which gives us -20.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input array [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2] and element 2 is -20.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    ind = array.index(elem)
    return ind * 2 + array[-ind - 1] * 3
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
