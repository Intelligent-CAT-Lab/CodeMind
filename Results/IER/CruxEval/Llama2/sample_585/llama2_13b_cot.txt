The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string that is the result of removing all occurrences of the first character of text from text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ';,,,?', we need to remove all occurrences of the first character of ';,,,?' from ';,,,?'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ';,,,?' is '????'.
<<<Output>>>
'????'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    count = text.count(text[0])
    ls = list(text)
    for _ in range(count):
        ls.remove(ls[0])
    return ''.join(ls)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(';,,,?')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
