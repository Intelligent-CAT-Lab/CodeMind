The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string indicating whether the input is a decimal number.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "abc", we need to check if "abc" is a decimal number.
Since "abc" is not a decimal number, the output of executing the function f on the input "abc" is "no".
<<<Output>>>
'no'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    if text.isdecimal():
        return 'yes'
    else:
        return 'no'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("123")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
