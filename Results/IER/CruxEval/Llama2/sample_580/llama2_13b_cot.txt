The function f takes a string text and a character char as input.
The function f returns a list of indices of the character char in the string text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'rvr' and 'r', we need to find the indices of the character 'r' in the string 'rvr'.
The character 'r' appears at indices 0, 2, and 4 in the string 'rvr'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'rvr' and 'r' is [0, 2, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 2, 4]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    new_text = text
    a = []
    while char in new_text:
        a.append(new_text.index(char))
        new_text = new_text.replace(char,"",1)
    return a
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('rvr', 'r')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
