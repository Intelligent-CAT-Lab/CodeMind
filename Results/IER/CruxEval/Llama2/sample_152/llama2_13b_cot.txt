The function f takes a string text as input and returns the number of uppercase letters in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ''.join(['A'] * 20), we need to count the number of uppercase letters in the string.
The string ''.join(['A'] * 20) is a string that contains 20 copies of the letter 'A'.
Each copy of the letter 'A' is uppercase, so the string contains 20 uppercase letters.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ''.join(['A'] * 20) is 20.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    n = 0
    for char in text:
        if char.isupper():
            n += 1
    return n
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(''.join(['A'] * 20))`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
