The function f takes three arguments a, b, and c, which are all iterables.
The function then creates a dictionary called result and iterates over each element in a, b, and c.
For each element, the function uses the dict.fromkeys() method to create a new key-value pair in the dictionary.
The function then returns the dictionary result.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b, c):
    result = {}
    for d in a, b, c:
        result.update(dict.fromkeys(d))
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f((1, ), (1, ), (1, 2))`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
