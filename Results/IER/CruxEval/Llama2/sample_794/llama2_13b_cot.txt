The function f takes a string line as input and returns the concatenation of the string "".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'", we need to concatenate the string "".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42' is "".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(line):
    a = []
    for c in line:
        if c.isalnum():
            a.append(c)
    return ''.join(a)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
