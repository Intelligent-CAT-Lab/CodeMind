The function f takes three arguments: text, suffix, and num.
The text argument is a string that is passed as the first argument to the function.
The suffix argument is a string that is passed as the second argument to the function.
The num argument is an integer that is passed as the third argument to the function.

The function f returns True if the text argument ends with the concatenation of the suffix argument and the string representation of the num argument.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'friends and love', 'and', 3, we need to check if the string 'friends and love' ends with the concatenation of the string 'and' and the string representation of the integer 3.

The string 'friends and love' ends with the string 'and', so we need to check if it also ends with the string representation of the integer 3.

The string 'friends and love' does not end with the string representation of the integer 3, so the function f returns False.

False

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, suffix, num):
    str_num = str(num)
    return text.endswith(suffix + str_num)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('friends and love', 'and', 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
