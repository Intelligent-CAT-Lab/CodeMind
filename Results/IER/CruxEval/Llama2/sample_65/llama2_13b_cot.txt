The function f takes two arguments: a list of integers nums and an integer index.
The function returns the remainder of the index's value modulo 42, multiplied by the value of the element at the index in the list nums, and then the element at the index is removed from the list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 2, 0, 3, 7] and index 3, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Calculate the remainder of 3 modulo 42, which is 1.
2. Multiply 1 by the value of the element at index 3 in the list, which is 3.
3. Remove the element at index 3 from the list, which leaves the list as [2, 0, 3, 7].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 2, 0, 3, 7] and index 3 is 6.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, index):
    return nums[index] % 42 + nums.pop(index) * 2
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([3, 2, 0, 3, 7], 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
