The function f takes two arguments: a list of integers nums and an integer i.
The function f removes the element at index i from the list nums and returns the updated list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47] and index 0, we need to remove the element at index 0 from the list and return the updated list.
The element at index 0 is 35, so the updated list is [45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47].
<<<Output>>>
[45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, i):
    nums.pop(i)
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47], 0)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
