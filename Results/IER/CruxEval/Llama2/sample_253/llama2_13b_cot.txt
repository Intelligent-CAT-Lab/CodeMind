The function f takes two strings as input: text and pref.
The function returns the substring of text that starts at the index of pref in text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "kumwwfv" and "k", we need to find the index of "k" in "kumwwfv".
The index of "k" in "kumwwfv" is 2, so the output of executing the function f on the input "kumwwfv" and "k" is "umwwfv".
<<<Output>>>
'umwwfv'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, pref):
    length = len(pref)
    if pref == text[:length]:
        return text[length:]
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('kumwwfv', 'k')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
