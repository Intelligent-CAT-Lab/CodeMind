The function f takes a string sentence as input and returns the capitalized and space-free version of the sentence.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "(A (b B))", we need to capitalize and remove spaces from the input.
The input "(A (b B))" becomes "A(b B)".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "(A (b B))" is "AB".
<<<Output>>>
'AB'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(sentence):
    if sentence == '':
        return ''
    sentence = sentence.replace('(', '')
    sentence = sentence.replace(')', '')
    return sentence.capitalize().replace(' ', '')
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('(A (b B))')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
