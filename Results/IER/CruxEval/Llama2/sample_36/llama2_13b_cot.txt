The function f takes a string text and a list of characters chars as input.
It returns the string text with the characters in chars removed from the end of the string if the string is not empty.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ha' and the empty list of characters, we need to remove the characters in the empty list from the end of the string 'ha'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ha' and the empty list of characters is 'ha'.
<<<Output>>>
'ha'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, chars):
    return text.rstrip(chars) if text else text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ha', 'a')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
