The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1], we need to sort the input list and then create a new list of numbers.
The input list [1] is sorted to [1].
The new list of numbers is created by inserting the number 1 at the beginning of the list and then appending the number 1 to the end of the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1] is [1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    new_nums = [nums[n//2]]
    
    if n % 2 == 0:
        new_nums = [nums[n//2 - 1], nums[n//2]]
    
    for i in range(0, n//2):
        new_nums.insert(0, nums[n-i-1])
        new_nums.append(nums[i])
    return new_nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
