The function f takes a string text and an integer n as input.
The function returns the substring of text that starts at index 0 and has length n.
If n is less than 0 or the length of text is less than n, the function returns text.
Otherwise, the function returns the substring of text that starts at index 0 and has length n.
The function then checks if the substring is equal to the original string.
If it is, the function returns the substring.
Otherwise, the function returns the substring that starts at index 0 and has length 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, n):
    if n < 0 or len(text) <= n:
        return text
    result = text[0 : n]
    i = len(result) - 1
    while i >= 0:
        if result[i]!= text[i]:
            break
        i -= 1
    return text[0 : i + 1]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('bR', -1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
