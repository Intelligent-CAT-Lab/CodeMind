The function f takes a string text and an integer chunks as input and returns a list of strings.
The string text is split into lines based on the number of characters in chunks.
The return value of the function f on the input '/alcm@ an)t//eprw)/e!/d\nujv', 0) is a list of strings.
The first string in the list is '/alcm@ an)t//eprw)', the second string is 'e!/d\nujv', and the third string is ''.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, chunks):
    return text.splitlines(chunks)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('/alcm@ an)t//eprw)/e!/d\nujv', 0)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
