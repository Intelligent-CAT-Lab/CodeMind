The function f takes a string text as input and returns True if the string is a space character, False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input'\t  \u3000', we need to check if the string is a space character.
The string'\t  \u3000' is a space character, so the output of executing the function f on the input'\t  \u3000' is True.
<<<Output>>>
True

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    return ''.join(list(text)).isspace()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(' \t  \u3000')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
