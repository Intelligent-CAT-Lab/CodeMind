The function f takes a list of strings sb as input and returns a dictionary d.
The dictionary d is initialized to an empty dictionary.
For each string s in the list sb, the dictionary d is updated with the key s and the value d[s] is set to the value of d.get(s, 0) + 1.
The value of d.get(s, 0) is the value of the key s in the dictionary d if it exists, or 0 if it does not exist.
The value of d[s] is then set to the sum of d.get(s, 0) + 1.
Finally, the dictionary d is returned as the output of the function f.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(sb):
    d = {}
    for s in sb:
        d[s] = d.get(s, 0) + 1
    return d
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('meow meow')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
