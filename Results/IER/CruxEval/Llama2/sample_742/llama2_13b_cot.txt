The function f takes a string text as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string contains only digits.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "-1-3", we need to iterate over the characters in the string and check if each character is a digit.
If a character is a digit, we set the boolean variable b to True.
If a character is not a digit, we set the boolean variable b to False and break out of the loop.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "-1-3" is False.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    b = True
    for x in text:
        if x.isdigit():
            b = True
        else:
            b = False
            break
    return b
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("-1-3")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
