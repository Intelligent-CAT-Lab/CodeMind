The function f takes two inputs: an array and an element.
The function returns the number of times the element appears in the array plus the element itself.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs [1, 1, 1] and -2, we need to count the number of times -2 appears in the array and add -2 to that count.

The element -2 appears once in the array, so the output of executing the function f on the inputs [1, 1, 1] and -2 is 1 + -2 = -1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    return array.count(elem) + elem
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 1, 1], -2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
