The function f takes three inputs: a list of integers nums, two integers pop1 and pop2.
The function f removes the element at index pop1 - 1 from the list nums and removes the element at index pop2 - 1 from the list nums.
The function f returns the list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 2, 3, 6], 2, 4], we need to remove the element at index 2 - 1 from the list [1, 5, 2, 3, 6] and remove the element at index 4 - 1 from the list [1, 5, 2, 3, 6].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 2, 3, 6], 2, 4] is [1, 5, 2, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 2, 3]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
