The function f takes three inputs: text, fill, and size.
The function f returns the right-justified version of the input text, with the fill character repeated to fill the remaining space.

The input text is "no asw".
The fill character is "j".
The size is 1.

The function f first checks if the size is less than 0.
If the size is less than 0, the function f sets the size to the negative of the size.

The function f then checks if the length of the input text is greater than the size.
If the length of the input text is greater than the size, the function f returns the last characters of the input text, which are "s".

If the length of the input text is not greater than the size, the function f returns the right-justified version of the input text, with the fill character repeated to fill the remaining space.
In this case, the function f returns the right-justified version of the input text, with the fill character repeated to fill the remaining space.

The output of the function f is "no asw".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, fill, size):
    if size < 0:
        size = -size
    if len(text) > size:
        return text[len(text) - size:]
    return text.rjust(size, fill)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('no asw', 'j', 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
