The function f takes a list of values as input and returns the list of values after sorting them.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1, 1], we need to sort the list of values and return the sorted list.
The list [1, 1, 1, 1] is already sorted, so the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1, 1] is [1, 1, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 1]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(values):
    values.sort()
    return values
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 1, 1, 1])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
