The function f takes a string s as input and returns True if the length of s is equal to the number of occurrences of the character '0' in s plus the number of occurrences of the character '1' in s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '102', we need to count the number of occurrences of the characters '0' and '1' in the string '102'.
The string '102' contains two occurrences of the character '0' and one occurrence of the character '1'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '102' is True.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return len(s) == s.count('0') + s.count('1')
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('102')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
