The function f takes a list num as input and returns the list num with the last element of num appended to the end of the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [70, 20, 9, 1], we need to append the last element of the input list to the end of the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [70, 20, 9, 1] is [70, 20, 9, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[70, 20, 9, 1, 1]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(num):
    num.append(num[-1])
    return num
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-70, 20, 9, 1])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
