The function f takes a string s as input and returns a string based on the value of s.

If s is a string that contains only letters, the function returns "yes".

If s is an empty string, the function returns "str is empty".

If s is not a string that contains only letters, the function returns "no".

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Boolean", we need to check if "Boolean" is a string that contains only letters, if it is an empty string, or if it is not a string that contains only letters.

If "Boolean" is a string that contains only letters, the function returns "yes".

If "Boolean" is an empty string, the function returns "str is empty".

If "Boolean" is not a string that contains only letters, the function returns "no".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "Boolean" is "no".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    if s.isalpha():
        return "yes"
    if s == "":
        return "str is empty"
    return "no"
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Boolean')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
