The function f takes a string text as input and returns the number of lines in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "145\n\n12fjkjg", we need to split the string into lines and count the number of lines.
The string "145\n\n12fjkjg" contains two lines, so the output of executing the function f on the input "145\n\n12fjkjg" is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    s = text.splitlines()
    return len(s)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("145\n\n12fjkjg")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
