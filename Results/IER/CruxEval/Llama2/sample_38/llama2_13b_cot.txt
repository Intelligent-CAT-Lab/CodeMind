The function f takes a string as input and returns the title case of the string with all spaces removed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "1oE-err bzz-bmm", we need to:

1. Convert the input to title case, which will result in "OneoEerr Bzzbmm".
2. Remove all spaces from the string, resulting in "OneoEerrBzzbmm".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "1oE-err bzz-bmm" is "OneoEerrBzzbmm".
<<<Output>>>
'OneoEerrBzzbmm'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    return string.replace(' ', '')
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('1oE-err bzz-bmm')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
