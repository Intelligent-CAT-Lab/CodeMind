The function f takes two inputs: an integer and a positive integer n.
The function f returns a string that is the integer represented in base n.
The function f uses a while loop to iterate until the length of the string representation of the integer is equal to n.
The function f then returns the string representation of the integer with the appropriate number of leading zeros.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs 8999 and 2, we need to convert 8999 to a string representation in base 2.
This can be done by iterating until the length of the string representation of 8999 is equal to 2.
The string representation of 8999 in base 2 is "10010001".
The function f then returns the string representation of 8999 with the appropriate number of leading zeros.
This results in the output "00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
