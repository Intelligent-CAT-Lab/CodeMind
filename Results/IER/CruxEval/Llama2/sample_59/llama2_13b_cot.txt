The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi ", we need to concatenate "hi " with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi " is "hia ".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    a = [char for char in s if char!='']
    b = a
    for c in reversed(a):
        if c =='':
            b.pop()
        else:
            break
    return ''.join(b)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('hi ')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
