The function f takes a string text and a character char as input.
The function f returns the string text after removing the character char from the beginning of the string text and then capitalizing the last character of the string text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "querist" and the character "u", we need to remove the character "u" from the beginning of the string "querist" and then capitalize the last character of the string "querist".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "querist" and the character "u" is "Querist".
<<<Output>>>
'Querist'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    if text:
        text = text.removeprefix(char)
        text = text.removeprefix(text[-1])
        text = text[:-1] + text[-1].capitalize()
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('querist', 'u')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
