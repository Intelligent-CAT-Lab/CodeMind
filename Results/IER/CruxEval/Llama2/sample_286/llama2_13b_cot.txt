The function f takes three inputs: an array, a value x, and an index i.
The function f returns the array with the value x at the index i.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], value x = 11, and index i = 4, we need to replace the value at index i with the value x.

The array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,11,9,10].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], value x = 11, and index i = 4 is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,11,9,10].
<<<Output>>>
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,11,9,10]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, x, i):
    if i < -len(array) or i > len(array) - 1:
        return 'no'
    temp = array[i]
    array[i] = x
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], 11, 4)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
