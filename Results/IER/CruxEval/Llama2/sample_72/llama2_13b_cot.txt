The function f takes a string text as input and returns a boolean value.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '99', we need to iterate over the characters in the string '99' and check if each character is a numeric character.
If any character is not a numeric character, the function f will return False.
If all characters are numeric characters, the function f will return True.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '99' is True.
<<<Output>>>
True

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    for c in text:
        if not c.isnumeric():
            return False
    return bool(text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('99')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
