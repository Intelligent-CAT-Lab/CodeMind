The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a character char.
The function returns the string that is the result of joining all the words in the string text with a space, where each word is separated from the next by the character char.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "a" and the character "a", we need to join all the words in the string "a" with a space, where each word is separated from the next by the character "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "a" and the character "a" is "a a".
<<<Output>>>
'a a'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    return''.join(text.split(char, len(text)))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('a', 'a')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
