The function f takes three arguments: a list of integers nums, an integer idx, and an integer added.
The function f modifies the list nums by inserting the integer added at the index idx.
The return value of the function f is the modified list nums.

To determine the return value of executing the function f on the input [2, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, 3], we need to insert the integer 3 at the index 2 in the list [2, 2, 2, 3, 3].
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input [2, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, 3] is [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3].
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, idx, added):
    nums[idx:idx] = (added,)
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([2, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
