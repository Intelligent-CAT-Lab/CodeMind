The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string that is the concatenation of the characters in text, with the exception of any characters that are digits.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input'm4n2o', we need to concatenate the characters in'm4n2o' with the exception of any characters that are digits.
This means that we need to concatenate the characters'm', 'a', 'n','', 'o', and'', resulting in the output'man2o'.

'man2o'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    ans = []
    for char in text:
        if char.isdigit():
            ans.append(char)
        else:
            ans.append(' ')
    return ''.join(ans)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('m4n2o')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
