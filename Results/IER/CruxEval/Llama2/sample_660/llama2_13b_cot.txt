The function f takes a number num as input and returns the sum of a list of numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 3, we need to determine the list of numbers that is generated by the code.

The initial list is [1].

The first iteration of the loop generates the list [1, 2].

The second iteration of the loop generates the list [1, 2, 3].

The third iteration of the loop generates the list [1, 2, 3, 4].

The final list is [1, 2, 3, 4].

The sum of this list is 10.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 3 is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(num):
    initial = [1]
    total = initial
    for _ in range(num):
        total = [1] + [x+y for x, y in zip(total, total[1:])]
        initial.append(total[-1])
    return sum(initial)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
