The function f takes a list orig as input and returns a copy of the list orig.
The function f then appends the integer 100 to the copy of the list orig.
The function f then removes the last element of the copy of the list orig.
The function f then returns the copy of the list orig.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(orig):
    copy = orig
    copy.append(100)
    orig.pop()
    return copy
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
