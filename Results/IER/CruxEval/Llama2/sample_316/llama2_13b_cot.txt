The function f takes a string name as input and returns a string that is the concatenation of the string "| " with the string that is the result of joining the string " ".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "i am your father", we need to concatenate "| " with the string that is the result of joining the string " ".
To determine the string that is the result of joining the string " ", we need to split the string "i am your father" on the space character and then join the resulting list of strings on the space character.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "i am your father" is "| i am your father |".
<<<Output>>>
'| i am your father |'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(name):
    return '|'+''.join(name.split(' ')) +'|'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('i am your father')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
