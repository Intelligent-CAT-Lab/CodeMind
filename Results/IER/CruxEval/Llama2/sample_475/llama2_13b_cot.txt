The function f takes an array and an index as input.
The function f returns the element at the specified index in the array.
If the index is less than 0, the function f adds the length of the array to the index to get the correct index.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1], 0, we need to find the element at index 0 in the array [1].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1], 0 is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, index):
    if index < 0:
        index = len(array) + index
    return array[index]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1], 0)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
