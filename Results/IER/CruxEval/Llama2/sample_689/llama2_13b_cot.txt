The function f takes an array arr as input and returns a new array.
The function f first calculates the length of the array arr, which is 4 in this case.
The function f then creates a copy of the array arr and stores it in a new array sub.
The function f then iterates over the array sub, starting at index 0 and incrementing by 2.
For each iteration, the function f multiplies the value at index i by 5.
Finally, the function f returns the array sub.

The output of executing the function f on the input array [-3, -6, 2, 7] is [-15, -30, 10, 35].
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(arr):
    count = len(arr)
    sub = arr.copy()
    for i in range(0, count, 2):
        sub[i] *= 5
    return sub
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-3, -6, 2, 7])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
