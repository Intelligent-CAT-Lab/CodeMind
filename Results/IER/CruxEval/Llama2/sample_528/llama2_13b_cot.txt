The function f takes a string s as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the string c in s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'papeluchis', we need to find the index of the first occurrence of the string c in 'papeluchis'.
The string c is 'papeluchis', so the first occurrence of c in 'papeluchis' is at index 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'papeluchis' is 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    b = ''
    c = ''
    for i in s:
        c = c + i
        if s.rfind(c) > -1:
            return s.rfind(c)
    return 0
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('papeluchis')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
