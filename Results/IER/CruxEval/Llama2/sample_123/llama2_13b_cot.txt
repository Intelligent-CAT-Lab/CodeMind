The function f takes an array and an element as input and returns a new array.
The function f iterates over the array and inserts the element into the array if the element is greater than the element and the previous element is less than the element.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [1, 2, 3, 5, 8] and the element 6, we need to iterate over the array and insert the element 6 into the array if the element is greater than the element and the previous element is less than the element.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input array [1, 2, 3, 5, 8] and the element 6 is [1, 2, 3, 6, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 6, 8]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    for idx, e in enumerate(array):
        if e > elem and array[idx - 1] < elem:
            array.insert(idx, elem)
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3, 5, 8], 6)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
