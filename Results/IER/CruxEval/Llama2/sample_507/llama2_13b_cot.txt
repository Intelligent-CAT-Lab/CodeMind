The function f takes two strings as input: text and search.
The function f returns the index of the first occurrence of the string search in the string text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "car hat" and "car", we need to find the index of the first occurrence of the string "car" in the string "car hat".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "car hat" and "car" is 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, search):
    result = text.lower()
    return result.find(search.lower())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('car hat', 'car')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
