The function f takes a string text as input and returns True if the number of hyphens in the string is equal to the length of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "---123-4", we need to count the number of hyphens in the string and compare it to the length of the string.
The string "---123-4" contains 4 hyphens, which is equal to its length.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "---123-4" is True.
<<<Output>>>
True

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    return text.count('-') == len(text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("---123-4")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
