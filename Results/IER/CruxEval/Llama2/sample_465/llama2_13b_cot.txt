The function f takes a list of strings and a string as input.
It returns a dictionary where the keys are the strings in the list and the values are the string "north".
If the input string is empty, the function returns the dictionary.
If the input string is not empty, it splits the string into a list of strings and updates the dictionary with the key-value pairs from the list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list ['wise king', 'young king'] and the empty string, we need to consider the following cases:

Case 1: The input string is empty.
In this case, the function returns the dictionary where the keys are the strings in the list and the values are the string "north".

Case 2: The input string is not empty.
In this case, the function splits the string into a list of strings and updates the dictionary with the key-value pairs from the list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list ['wise king', 'young king'] and the empty string is a dictionary where the keys are the strings in the list and the values are the string "north".
<<<Output>>>
{'wise king': 'north', 'young king': 'north'}

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(seq, value):
    roles = dict.fromkeys(seq, 'north')
    if value:
        roles.update(key.strip() for key in value.split(', '))
    return roles
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['wise king', 'young king'], 'north, south')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
