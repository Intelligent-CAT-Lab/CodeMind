The function f takes a string text as input and returns the boolean value of whether the string is not a decimal number.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "the speed is -36 miles per hour", we need to check if the string is not a decimal number.
The string "the speed is -36 miles per hour" is not a decimal number, so the output of executing the function f on the input "the speed is -36 miles per hour" is True.
<<<Output>>>
True

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    return text.isdecimal()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('the speed is -36 miles per hour')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
