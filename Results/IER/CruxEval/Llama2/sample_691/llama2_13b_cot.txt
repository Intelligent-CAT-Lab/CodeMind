The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a string suffix.
The function f returns the string text if the suffix is empty or if the last character of the suffix is not present in the string text.
Otherwise, the function f recursively calls itself with the string text.rstrip(suffix[-1]), which removes the last character of the suffix from the string text, and the string suffix[:-1], which removes the last character of the suffix.

The function f is called with the input 'rpyttc' and the suffix 'cyt'.
The last character of the suffix is 't', which is not present in the string 'rpyttc'.
Therefore, the function f returns the string 'rpyttc'.
<<<Output>>>
'rpyttc'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, suffix):
    if suffix and suffix[-1] in text:
        return f(text.rstrip(suffix[-1]), suffix[:-1])
    else:
        return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('rpyttc', 'cyt')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
