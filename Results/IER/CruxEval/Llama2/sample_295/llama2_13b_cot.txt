The function f takes a list of fruits as input and returns a string indicating whether the list contains two fruits that are the same.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list ['apple', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'pear', 'orange', 'orange'], we need to check if the list contains two fruits that are the same.

We can see that the list contains two fruits that are the same, namely 'apple' and 'orange'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list ['apple', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'pear', 'orange', 'orange'] is 'no'.
<<<Output>>>
'no'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
