The function f takes a string st as input and returns the result of executing the function f on the string e, where e is the result of applying the function rjust to st with the arguments 10 and's'.

The function rjust takes a string and two arguments, the first of which is an integer and the second of which is a string.
It returns a string that is padded with the second argument to the right until it is the specified length.

The function f first checks if the first character of st is '~'.
If it is, it returns the result of applying the function rjust to the string e, where e is the result of applying the function rjust to st with the arguments 10 and's'.

If the first character of st is not '~', it returns the result of applying the function rjust to st with the arguments 10 and 'n'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'eqe-;ew22', we need to determine the output of executing the function f on the input e, where e is the result of applying the function rjust to 'eqe-;ew22' with the arguments 10 and's'.

Then, we need to determine the output of executing the function f on the input e, where e is the result of applying the function rjust to 'eqe-;ew22' with the arguments 10 and 'n'.

Finally, we need to concatenate the output of executing the function f on the input e, where e is the result of applying the function rjust to 'eqe-;ew22' with the arguments 10 and's' with the output of executing the function f on the input e, where e is the result of applying the function rjust to 'eqe-;ew22' with the arguments 10 and 'n'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'eqe-;ew22' is 'eqe-;ew22'.
