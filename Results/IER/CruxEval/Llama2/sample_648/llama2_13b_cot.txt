The function f takes two lists as input and returns the first element of the first list that is not in the second list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input lists [0, 4, 5, 6] and [13, 23, -5, 0], we need to iterate through the first list and check if each element is in the second list.
If the element is not in the second list, we return it.
If the element is in the second list, we remove it from the first list and continue checking the remaining elements.

When we iterate through the first list, the first element is 0, which is not in the second list.
Therefore, we return 0 as the output.
<<<Output>>>
0

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
