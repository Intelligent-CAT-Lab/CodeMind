The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list of integers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 6, 8, 4], we need to:
1. Determine the length of the input list, which is 5.
2. Create a new empty list.
3. Iterate through the input list and append each element to the new list.
4. Return the new list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 6, 8, 4] is [5, 8, 6, 8, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 8, 6, 8, 4]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(list_x):
    item_count = len(list_x)
    new_list = []
    for i in range(item_count):
        new_list.append(list_x.pop())
    return new_list
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, 8, 6, 8, 4])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
