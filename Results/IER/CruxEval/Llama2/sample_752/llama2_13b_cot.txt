The function f takes a string s and an integer amount as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "z" repeated amount - len(s) times.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "abc" and amount 8, we need to concatenate "abc" with "z" repeated 8 - len("abc") times.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "abc" and amount 8 is "zzzzzzabc".
<<<Output>>>
'zzzzzzabc'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, amount):
    return (amount - len(s)) * 'z' + s
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('abc', 8)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
