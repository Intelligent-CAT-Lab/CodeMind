The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a delimiter delim.
The function returns the string text, but with the characters reversed and with the delimiter delim removed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "dsj osq wi w" and the delimiter " ", we need to reverse the string "dsj osq wi w" and then remove the delimiter " " from the reversed string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "dsj osq wi w" and the delimiter " " is "jwq osd wi".
<<<Output>>>
'jwq osd wi'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, delim):
    return text[:text[::-1].find(delim)][::-1]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('dsj osq wi w','')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
