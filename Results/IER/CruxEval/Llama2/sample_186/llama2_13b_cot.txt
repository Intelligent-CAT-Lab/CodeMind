The function f takes a string text as input and returns the concatenation of the string text with the string " ".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "pvtso", we need to concatenate "pvtso" with " ".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "pvtso" is "pvtso ".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    return''.join(map(str.lstrip, text.split()))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('pvtso')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
