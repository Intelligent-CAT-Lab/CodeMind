The function f takes a string str as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is alphanumeric.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "777", we need to check if the string "777" is alphanumeric.
Since "777" is not alphanumeric, the output of executing the function f on the input "777" is "False".
<<<Output>>>
'False'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(str):
    if str.isalnum():
        return "True"
    return "False"
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('777')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
