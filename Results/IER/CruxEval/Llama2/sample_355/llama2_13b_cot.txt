The function f takes a string text and a string prefix as input.
It returns the substring of text that starts at the index of the length of prefix and ends at the end of the string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '123x John z' and prefix 'z', we need to find the index of the length of prefix in the string '123x John z'.
This index is 4, which is the length of the string 'z'.

We then need to find the substring of '123x John z' that starts at index 4 and ends at the end of the string.
This substring is '123x John', which is the output of executing the function f on the input '123x John z' and prefix 'z'.
<<<Output>>>
'123x John'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, prefix):
    return text[len(prefix):]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('123x John z', 'z')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
