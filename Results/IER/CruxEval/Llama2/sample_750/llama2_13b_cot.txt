The function f takes two arguments: a dictionary char_map and a string text.
The function f iterates over the characters in the string text and updates the string new_text.
For each character in text, the function f looks up the value of the character in the dictionary char_map.
If the value of the character in char_map is None, the function f appends the character to new_text.
Otherwise, the function f appends the value of the character in char_map to new_text.

The function f returns the string new_text.

Therefore, the return value of the function f on the input ({}, 'hbd') is ''.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(char_map, text):
    new_text = ''
    for ch in text:
        val = char_map.get(ch)
        if val is None:
            new_text += ch
        else:
            new_text += val
    return new_text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({}, 'hbd')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
