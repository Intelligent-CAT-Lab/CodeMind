The function f takes a list list and an operation operation as input.
The function f returns the list list after the operation operation has been applied to the list list.

The function f first creates a copy of the list list, which is stored in the variable new_list.
The variable new_list is then sorted in ascending order.
The operation operation is then applied to the sorted list new_list.
The list list is then returned.

In this case, the operation operation is a lambda function that takes a list as input and returns the list in reverse order.
Therefore, the return value of the function f on the input list [6, 4, 2, 8, 15] and the operation operation is the list [15, 8, 2, 4, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[15, 8, 2, 4, 6]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(list, operation):
    new_list = list[:]
    new_list.sort()
    operation(new_list)
    return list
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([6, 4, 2, 8, 15], (lambda x: x.reverse()))`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
