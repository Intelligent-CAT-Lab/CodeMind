The function f takes two integers n and m as input.
The function f creates an empty list arr and then iterates over the range of integers from 1 to n+1.
For each iteration, the function f clears the list arr.
Finally, the function f returns the list arr.

The function f is executed with the input (1, 3).
The function f creates an empty list arr and then iterates over the range of integers from 1 to 4.
For each iteration, the function f clears the list arr.
Finally, the function f returns the list arr.

The return value of the function f with the input (1, 3) is the list [1, 2, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n, m):
    arr = list(range(1, n+1))
    for i in range(m):
        arr.clear()
    return arr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(1, 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
