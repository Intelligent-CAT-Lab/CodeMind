The function f takes a string text as input and returns the number of words in the string that are longer than the longest word in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl", we need to split the input string into individual words and then count the number of words that are longer than the longest word in the string.
The longest word in the input string is "wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl", which has a length of 30 characters.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl" is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    m = 0
    cnt = 0
    for i in text.split():
        if len(i) > m:
            cnt += 1
            m = len(i)
    return cnt
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
