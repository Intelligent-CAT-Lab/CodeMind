The function f takes a string text and a character char as input.
The function f returns a new string that is the result of removing all occurrences of the character char from the input string text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "o horseto" and the character "r", we need to remove all occurrences of the character "r" from the input string.
The character "r" appears once in the input string, at the index 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "o horseto" and the character "r" is "o horseto".
<<<Output>>>
'o horseto'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    length = len(text)
    index = -1
    for i in range(length):
        if text[i] == char:
            index = i
    if index == -1:
        index = length // 2
    new_text = list(text)
    new_text.pop(index)
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('o horseto', 'r')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
