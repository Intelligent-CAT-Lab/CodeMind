The function f takes a string row as input and returns a tuple containing the number of occurrences of the character '1' in row and the number of occurrences of the character '0' in row.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "100010010", we need to count the number of occurrences of the character '1' and the number of occurrences of the character '0' in the input.
The input "100010010" contains 3 occurrences of the character '1' and 2 occurrences of the character '0'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "100010010" is (3, 2).
<<<Output>>>
(3, 2)

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(row):
    return (row.count('1'), row.count('0'))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("100010010")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
