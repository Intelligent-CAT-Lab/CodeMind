The function f takes a string text as input and returns either "ascii" or "non ascii" depending on whether the string is ASCII or not.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "<<<<", we need to check if the string is ASCII or not.
The string "<<<<" is not ASCII, so the output of executing the function f on the input "<<<<" is "non ascii".
<<<Output>>>
'non ascii'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    if text.isascii():
        return 'ascii'
    else:
        return 'non ascii'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("<<<<")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
