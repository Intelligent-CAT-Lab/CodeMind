The function f takes two arguments: a string s and an integer tab.
The function returns the string s with each tab character replaced by the number of spaces specified by tab.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Join us in Hungary" and tab 4, we need to replace each tab character in the string with 4 spaces.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "Join us in Hungary" and tab 4 is "Join us in Hungary    ".
<<<Output>>>
'Join us in Hungary    '

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, tab):
    return s.expandtabs(tab)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("Join us in Hungary", 4)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
