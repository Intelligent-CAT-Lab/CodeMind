The function f takes two inputs: a number n and a list array.
The function f returns a list of lists, where each inner list is a copy of the input list array.
For each iteration of the loop, the function f creates a copy of the input list array and appends it to the end of the list of lists.
The function f returns the list of lists, which contains a single copy of the input list array.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n, array):
    final = [array.copy()] 
    for i in range(n):
        arr = array.copy()
        arr.extend(final[-1])
        final.append(arr)
    return final
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(1, [1, 2, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
