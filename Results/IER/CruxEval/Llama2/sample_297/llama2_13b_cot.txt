The function f takes a number num as input and returns a string.
The function f has an if statement that checks if the number num is between 0 and 1000 and is not equal to 6174.
If the number num satisfies these conditions, the function returns the string "Half Life".
Otherwise, the function returns the string "Not found".

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 6173, we need to check if the number 6173 is between 0 and 1000 and is not equal to 6174.
The number 6173 is not equal to 6174, but it is not between 0 and 1000.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 6173 is "Not found".
<<<Output>>>
'Not found'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(num):
    if 0 < num < 1000 and num!= 6174:
        return 'Half Life'
    return 'Not found'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(6173)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
