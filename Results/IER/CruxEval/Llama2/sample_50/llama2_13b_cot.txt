The function f takes a list lst as input and returns a new list.
The function f first clears the list lst.
Then, the function f adds a list of 1s to the list lst, where the length of the list is equal to the length of lst plus 1.
Therefore, the return value of the function f on the input list ['a', 'c', 'v'] is the list [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    lst.clear()
    lst += [1] * (len(lst) + 1)
    return lst
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
