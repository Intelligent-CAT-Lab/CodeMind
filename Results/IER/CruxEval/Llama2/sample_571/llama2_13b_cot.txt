The function f takes two arguments: an input string and an integer representing the number of spaces to insert between characters.
The function returns the input string with the specified number of spaces inserted between each character.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input r'a\tb' and the number of spaces 4, we need to insert 4 spaces between each character in the input string.
This results in the output "a    b".
<<<Output>>>
'a    b'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(input_string, spaces):
    return input_string.expandtabs(spaces)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(r'a\tb', 4)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
