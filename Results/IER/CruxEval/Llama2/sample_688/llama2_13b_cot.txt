The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of unique numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8], we need to iterate through the input list and append each number to a new list if it is not already present in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8] is [3, 1, 9, 0, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[3, 1, 9, 0, 2]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    l = []
    for i in nums:
        if i not in l:
            l.append(i)
    return l
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
