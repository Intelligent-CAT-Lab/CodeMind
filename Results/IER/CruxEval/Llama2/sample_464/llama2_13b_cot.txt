The function f takes a string ans as input and returns a value based on whether ans is a decimal number.
If ans is a decimal number, the function f calculates the total value of ans by multiplying it by 4 and subtracting 50.
It then subtracts the length of the list of characters in ans that are not in the set ['0', '2', '4', '6', '8'] multiplied by 100.
If ans is not a decimal number, the function f returns the string 'NAN'.

To determine the return value of executing the function f on the input '0', we need to check if '0' is a decimal number.
Since '0' is a decimal number, the function f calculates the total value of '0' by multiplying it by 4 and subtracting 50.
It then subtracts the length of the list of characters in '0' that are not in the set ['0', '2', '4', '6', '8'] multiplied by 100.
Therefore, the return value of executing the function f on the input '0' is 100.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(ans):
    if ans.isdecimal():
        total = int(ans) * 4 - 50
        total -= len([c for c in list(ans) if c not in '02468']) * 100
        return total
    return 'NAN'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('0')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
