The function f takes a string text as input and returns the concatenation of the first character of text with the rest of the string text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "xzd", we need to concatenate the first character of "xzd" with the rest of the string "xzd".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "xzd" is "X".
<<<Output>>>
'X'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    if len(text) == 0:
        return ''
    text = text.lower()
    return text[0].upper() + text[1:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('xzd')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
