The function f takes two arguments: length and text.
The function f returns the string text if the length of text is equal to length.
Otherwise, it returns False.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (-5, 'G5ogb6f,c7e.EMm'), we need to check if the length of the string 'G5ogb6f,c7e.EMm' is equal to -5.
Since the length of 'G5ogb6f,c7e.EMm' is 19, which is not equal to -5, the function f returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(length, text):
    if len(text) == length:
        return text[::-1]
    return False
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(-5, 'G5ogb6f,c7e.EMm')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
