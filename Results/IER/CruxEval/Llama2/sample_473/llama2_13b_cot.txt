The function f takes a string text and a character value as input.
It returns a new string by removing all occurrences of the character value from the input string text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input'scedvtvotkwqfoqn' and the character 'o', we need to remove all occurrences of the character 'o' from the input string.

The character 'o' appears at the following positions in the input string:

1. At position 10
2. At position 11
3. At position 12
4. At position 13
5. At position 14
6. At position 15
7. At position 16
8. At position 17
9. At position 18
10. At position 19

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input'scedvtvotkwqfoqn' and the character 'o' is'scdvtvotkwqfoqn'.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, value):
    indexes = list()
    for i in range(len(text)):
        if text[i] == value:
            indexes.append(i)
    new_text = list(text)
    for i in indexes:
        new_text.remove(value)
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('scedvtvotkwqfoqn', 'o')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
