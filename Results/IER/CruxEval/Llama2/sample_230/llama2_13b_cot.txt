The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string.
The function f iterates through the characters of the input string text, starting from the last character and moving towards the first character.
For each character, the function f checks if the character is an alphabetical character.
If the character is an alphabetical character, the function f adds the character to the output string result.
The function f continues this process until it reaches the first character of the input string text.

The input string text is "102x0zoq".
The output string result is "102x0zoq".
<<<Output>>>
'102x0zoq'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    result = ''
    i = len(text)-1
    while i >= 0:
        c = text[i]
        if c.isalpha():
            result += c
        i -= 1
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('102x0zoq')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
