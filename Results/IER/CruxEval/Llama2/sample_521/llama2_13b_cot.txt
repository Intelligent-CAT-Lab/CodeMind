The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers.
The function f first finds the maximum integer in the input list and then reverses the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list [43, 0, 4, 77, 5, 2, 0, 9, 77], we need to find the maximum integer in the input list and then reverse the input list.
The maximum integer in the input list is 77, so the input list is reversed to [9, 0, 2, 5, 77, 4, 0, 43].

The function f then returns the reversed input list, which is [9, 0, 2, 5, 77, 4, 0, 43].
<<<Output>>>
[9, 0, 2, 5, 77, 4, 0, 43]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    m = max(nums)
    for i in range(m):
        nums.reverse()
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([43, 0, 4, 77, 5, 2, 0, 9, 77])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
