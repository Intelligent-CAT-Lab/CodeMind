The function f takes a dictionary dic as input and returns a new dictionary d.
The dictionary d is initialized to an empty dictionary.
For each key in dic, the key is added to the dictionary d.
The value associated with the key is the value of the last item in the dictionary dic.popitem(last = False).
The dictionary dic is modified by removing the last item.
The return value of the function f is the dictionary d.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(dic):
    d = {}
    for key in dic:
        d[key] = dic.popitem(last = False)[1]
    return d
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({"a": 1, "b": 2})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
