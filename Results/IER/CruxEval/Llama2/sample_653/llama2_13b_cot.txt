The function f takes a string text and a character letter as input.
The function f returns the number of times the character letter appears in the string text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "c, c, c,c, c" and "c", we need to count the number of times the character "c" appears in the string "c, c, c,c, c".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "c, c, c,c, c" and "c" is 5.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, letter):
    t = text
    for alph in text:
        t = t.replace(alph, "")
    return len(t.split(letter))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("c, c, c,c, c", "c")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
