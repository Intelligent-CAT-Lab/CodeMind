The function f takes a variable var as input and returns the number of non-zero elements in var.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 1, we need to count the number of non-zero elements in 1.
There is only one element in 1, which is 1, and it is non-zero, so the output of executing the function f on the input 1 is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(var):
    amount = len(var) if type(var) == list else 0
    if type(var) == dict:
        amount = len(var.keys())
    nonzero = amount if amount > 0 else 0
    return nonzero
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
