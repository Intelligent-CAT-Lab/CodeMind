The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns the number of names in the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee'], we need to count the number of names in the list.
The first string in the list is "sharron", which is a name, so the number of names in the list is 1.
The second string in the list is "Savannah", which is a name, so the number of names in the list is 2.
The third string in the list is "Mike Cherokee", which is not a name, so the number of names in the list is 2.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee'] is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
