The function f takes two arguments: an array and a value.
The array is a list of integers, and the value is an integer.
The function f first reverses the array, then removes the first element from the array, and stores it in a variable called "odd".
Then, it creates a new list called "tmp" and stores the value in it.
It then appends the list "tmp" to the list "odd".
Finally, it returns the list "result".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, value):
    array.reverse()
    array.pop()
    odd = []
    while len(array) > 0:
        tmp = {}
        tmp[array.pop()] = value
        odd.append(tmp)
    result = {}
    while len(odd) > 0:
        result.update(odd.pop())
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['23'], 123)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
