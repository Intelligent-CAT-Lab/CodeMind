The function f takes a string text as input and returns a list of characters that appear in the string text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "x--y-z-5-C", we need to:

1. Replace all hyphens in the input with empty strings.
2. Convert the input to lowercase.
3. Create a dictionary d where the key is the character and the value is the number of times that character appears in the input.
4. Sort the dictionary d by the value of each key.
5. Return a list of the keys in the dictionary d.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "x--y-z-5-C" is ['x', 'y', 'z', '5', 'c'].
<<<Output>>>
['x', 'y', 'z', '5', 'c']

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    d = {}
    for char in text.replace('-', '').lower():
        d[char] = d[char] + 1 if char in d else 1
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    return [val for i, val in d]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("x--y-z-5-C")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
