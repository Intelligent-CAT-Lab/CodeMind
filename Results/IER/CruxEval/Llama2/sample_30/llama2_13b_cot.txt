The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The function f iterates over the elements of the input array and appends each element to the output array if the element is either a string that is ASCII or an integer that is not ASCII.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array ["a", "b", "c"], we need to iterate over the elements of the input array and append each element to the output array if the element is either a string that is ASCII or an integer that is not ASCII.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input array ["a", "b", "c"] is ["a", "b", "c"].
<<<Output>>>
['a', 'b', 'c']

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    result = []
    for elem in array:
        if elem.isascii() or (isinstance(elem, int) and not str(abs(elem)).isascii()):
            result.append(elem)
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(["a", "b", "c"])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
