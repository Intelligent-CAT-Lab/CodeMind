The function f takes a list lst as input and returns a new list.
The function f iterates through the list lst and appends each element of lst to a new list new_list if the element is not in the list lst[i+1:].
The function f also checks if the length of the new list is 3.
If the length of the new list is 3, the function f returns the new list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 2, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 0], we need to iterate through the list and check if each element is in the list [2, 6, 3].
The first element of the input list, 0, is not in the list [2, 6, 3], so it is appended to the new list.
The second element of the input list, 2, is in the list [2, 6, 3], so it is not appended to the new list.
The third element of the input list, 1, is not in the list [2, 6, 3], so it is appended to the new list.
The fourth element of the input list, 2, is in the list [2, 6, 3], so it is not appended to the new list.
The fifth element of the input list, 6, is in the list [2, 6, 3], so it is not appended to the new list.
The sixth element of the input list, 2, is in the list [2, 6, 3], so it is not appended to the new list.
The seventh element of the input list, 6, is in the list [2, 6, 3], so it is not appended to the new list.
The eighth element of the input list, 3, is not in the list [2, 6, 3], so it is appended to the new list.
The ninth element of the input list, 0, is not in the list [2, 6, 3], so it is appended to the new list.

Since the length of the new list is not 3, the function f does not return
