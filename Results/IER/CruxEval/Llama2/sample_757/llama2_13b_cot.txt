The function f takes three arguments: text, char, and replace.
The text argument is a string that is passed as the first argument to the function.
The char argument is a character that is passed as the second argument to the function.
The replace argument is a string that is passed as the third argument to the function.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'a1a8', '1', 'n2', we need to replace the character '1' in the string 'a1a8' with the string 'n2'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'a1a8', '1', 'n2' is 'a1a8'.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char, replace):
    return text.replace(char, replace)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('a1a8', '1', 'n2')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
