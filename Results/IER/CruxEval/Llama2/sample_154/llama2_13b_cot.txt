The function f takes two inputs: a string s and a character c.
The function f first splits the input string s into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter.
Then, the function f concatenates the character c with a space character and the reversed list of words, using the join function to concatenate the list of words.
Finally, the function f returns the resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'Hello There' and the character '*', we need to concatenate the character '*' with a space character and the reversed list of words, using the join function to concatenate the list of words.
The resulting string is "Hello There*  *".
<<<Output>>>
'Hello There*  *'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, c):
    s = s.split(' ')
    return ((c + "  ") + ("  ".join(s[::-1])))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Hello There', '*')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
