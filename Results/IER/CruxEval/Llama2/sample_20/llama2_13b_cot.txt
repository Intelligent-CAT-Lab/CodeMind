The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'was,', we need to iterate through the string 'was,' from the last character to the first character.
For each character, we append it to the result string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'was,' is 'was'.
<<<Output>>>
'was'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    result = ''
    for i in range(len(text)-1, -1, -1):
        result += text[i]
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('was,')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
