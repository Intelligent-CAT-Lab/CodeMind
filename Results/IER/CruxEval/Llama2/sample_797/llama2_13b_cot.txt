The function f takes a dictionary dct as input and returns a list of tuples.
The list of tuples is created by iterating over the keys of the dictionary dct and appending each key-value pair to the list.
The keys are sorted before appending to the list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input { 'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3 }, we need to iterate over the keys of the dictionary and append each key-value pair to the list.
The keys are sorted before appending to the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input { 'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3 } is [( 'a', 1 ), ( 'b', 2 ), ( 'c', 3 )].
<<<Output>>>
[( 'a', 1 ), ( 'b', 2 ), ( 'c', 3 )]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(dct):
    lst = []
    for key in sorted(dct):
        lst.append((key, dct[key]))
    return lst
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
