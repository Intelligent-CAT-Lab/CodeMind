The function f takes a string s, a character from_c, and a character to_c as input.
It returns the string s translated using the character mapping table specified by the character from_c and the character to_c.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'aphid', 'i', and '?', we need to translate the string 'aphid' using the character mapping table specified by the character 'i' and the character '?'.

The character mapping table specified by the character 'i' and the character '?' is:

<Table>
i?
a?
p?
h?
i?
d?
</Table>

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'aphid', 'i', and '?' is '?phid?'.
<<<Output>>>
'?phid?'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, from_c, to_c):
    table = s.maketrans(from_c, to_c)
    return s.translate(table)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('aphid', 'i', '?')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
