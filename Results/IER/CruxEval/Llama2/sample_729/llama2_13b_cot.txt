The function f takes two strings s1 and s2 as input and returns a list of integers.
The function f uses the method rfind to find the index of the first occurrence of the string s2 in the string s1.
The function f then uses the method rfind to find the index of the first occurrence of the string s2 in the string s1, starting from the index of the first occurrence of the string s2 in the string s1.
The function f then appends the index of the first occurrence of the string s2 in the string s1 to the list of integers.
The function f then repeats this process until the index of the first occurrence of the string s2 in the string s1 is -1, which indicates that the string s2 is not found in the string s1.
The function f then returns the list of integers.

The input to the function f is 'abcdefghabc' and 'abc'.
The function f finds the index of the first occurrence of the string 'abc' in the string 'abcdefghabc' using the method rfind.
The function f then finds the index of the first occurrence of the string 'abc' in the string 'abcdefghabc', starting from the index of the first occurrence of the string 'abc' in the string 'abcdefghabc'.
The function f then appends the index of the first occurrence of the string 'abc' in the string 'abcdefghabc' to the list of integers.
The function f then repeats this process until the index of the first occurrence of the string 'abc' in the string 'abcdefghabc' is -1, which indicates that the string 'abc' is not found in the string 'abcdefghabc'.
The function f then returns the list of integers.

The output of the function f on the input 'abcdefghabc' and 'abc' is [0, 3, 6].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s1,s2):
    res = []
    i = s1.rfind(s2)
    while i!= -1:
        res.
