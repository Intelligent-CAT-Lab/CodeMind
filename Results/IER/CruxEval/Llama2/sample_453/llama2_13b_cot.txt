The function f takes a string and a character as input and returns True if the string ends with the character, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'wrsch)xjmb8' and 'c', we need to check if the string ends with the character 'c'.
The string 'wrsch)xjmb8' does not end with the character 'c', so the output of executing the function f on the input 'wrsch)xjmb8' and 'c' is False.
<<<Output>>>
False

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string, c):
    return string.endswith(c)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('wrsch)xjmb8', 'c')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
