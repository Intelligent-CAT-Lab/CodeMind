The function f takes three inputs: a string s, an integer n, and a string c.
The function f returns the string s, where the string c is repeated n times to the left of s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs ".", 0, and "99", we need to repeat the string "99" 0 times to the left of the string ".".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs ".", 0, and "99" is ".99".
<<<Output>>>
'.99'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, n, c):
    width = len(c)*n
    for _ in range(width - len(s)):
        s = c + s
    return s
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('a', 0, '99')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
