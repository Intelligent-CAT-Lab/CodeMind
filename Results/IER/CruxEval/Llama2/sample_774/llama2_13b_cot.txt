The function f takes two inputs: a number num and a string name.
The function f returns a string f_str that is formatted with the values of num and name.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (23, 'Cornareti'), we need to format the string f_str with the values of num and name.

The value of num is 23, and the value of name is 'Cornareti'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (23, 'Cornareti') is 'quiz leader = Cornareti, count = 23'.
<<<Output>>>
'quiz leader = Cornareti, count = 23'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(num, name):
    f_str = 'quiz leader = {}, count = {}'
    return f_str.format(name, num)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(23, 'Cornareti')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
