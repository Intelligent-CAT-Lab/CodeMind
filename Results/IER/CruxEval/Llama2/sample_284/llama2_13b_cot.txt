The function f takes two strings as input: text and prefix.
The function f returns the substring of text that starts at the index idx and ends at the end of the string.
The function f returns None if the substring does not start with the prefix.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "bestest" and prefix "bestest", we need to determine if the substring of "bestest" that starts at the index 0 and ends at the end of the string starts with the prefix "bestest".

The substring of "bestest" that starts at the index 0 and ends at the end of the string is "est".
The substring "est" does not start with the prefix "bestest", so the function f returns None.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, prefix):
    idx = 0
    for letter in prefix:
        if text[idx]!= letter:
            return None
        idx += 1
    return text[idx:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('bestest', 'bestest')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
