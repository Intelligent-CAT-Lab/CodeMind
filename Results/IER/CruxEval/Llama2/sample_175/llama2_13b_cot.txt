The function f takes a string s and an integer amount as input.
It splits the string s into a list of lines using the splitlines() method.
It then finds the maximum index of a space in each line using the map() method and the lambda function.
It then creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a line from the list of lines and the number of spaces to add to the end of the line.
It then iterates through the list of tuples and adds the specified number of spaces to the end of each line.
Finally, it joins the list of lines together using the '\n' character and returns the result.
<<<Output>>>
' \n \n'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, amount):
    lines = s.splitlines()
    w = max(map(lambda l: l.rfind(' '), lines))
    ls = [[l, (w + 1) * amount - l.rfind(' ')] for l in lines]
    for i, line in enumerate(ls):
        ls[i][0] = line[0] +'' * line[1]
    return '\n'.join(map(lambda l: l[0], ls))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('\n', 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
