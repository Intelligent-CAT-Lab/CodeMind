The function f takes a string text and a character char as input.
The function f returns the string text with the character char removed.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "pn" and the character "p", we need to remove the character "p" from the string "pn".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "pn" and the character "p" is "n".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    text = list(text)
    for count, item in enumerate(text):
        if item == char:
            text.remove(item)
            return ''.join(text)
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('pn', 'p')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
