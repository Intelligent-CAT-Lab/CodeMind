The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns a string representation of the list in reverse order.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 9, 3, 1, -2], we need to reverse the list and then join the elements of the list into a string using the ''.join() method.
The reverse() method returns a copy of the list in reverse order, so the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 9, 3, 1, -2] is ['-2', '-1', '1', '3', '9'].
Then, we can use the ''.join() method to join the elements of the list into a string, resulting in the output '1-39-1-2'.
<<<Output>>>
'1-39-1-2'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    nums.reverse()
    return ''.join(map(str, nums))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-1, 9, 3, 1, -2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
