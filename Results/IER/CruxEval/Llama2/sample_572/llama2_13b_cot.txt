The function f takes a dictionary data and an integer num as input.
The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key and a value from the dictionary data.
The function also returns a dictionary new_dict, which contains the keys from the dictionary data that are not in the list of tuples.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1} and num 1, we need to:

1. Create a list of tuples from the dictionary data, where each tuple contains a key and a value from the dictionary.
2. Create a dictionary new_dict, which contains the keys from the dictionary data that are not in the list of tuples.
3. Return the list of tuples and the dictionary new_dict.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1} and num 1 is:

[('3', 1), ('2', 10), ('1', 9)]
{'1': None, '3': None}

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(data, num):
    new_dict = {}
    temp = list(data.items())
    for i in range(len(temp) - 1, num - 1, -1):
        new_dict[temp[i]] = None
    return temp[num:] + list(new_dict.items())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1}, 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
