The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The function first creates a copy of the input array and then reverses the order of the elements in the copy.
Finally, the function returns a new array containing the squares of the elements in the reversed copy.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 1], we need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a copy of the input array [1, 2, 1]
2. Reverse the order of the elements in the copy
3. Square the elements in the reversed copy

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 1] is [1, 4, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 1]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    new_array = array.copy()
    new_array = reversed(new_array)
    return [x*x for x in new_array]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 1])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
