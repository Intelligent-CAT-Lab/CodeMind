The function f takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary that is a copy of the first dictionary with the values from the second dictionary added to it.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input dictionaries, we need to create a new dictionary that is a copy of the first dictionary, and then add the values from the second dictionary to it.

The first dictionary has the key "disface" with the value 9, and the key "cam" with the value 7.
The second dictionary has the key "mforce" with the value 5.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input dictionaries is a new dictionary with the key "disface" with the value 9, the key "cam" with the value 7, and the key "mforce" with the value 5.
<<<Output>>>
{'disface': 9, 'cam': 7,'mforce': 5}

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
