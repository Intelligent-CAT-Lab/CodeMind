The function f takes an array as input and returns a sorted array of the elements of the input array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14], we need to sort the elements of the input array in descending order.
The elements of the input array are [4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14].
The sorted array of these elements in descending order is [14, 43, 89, 17, 8, 4].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input array [4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14] is [14, 43, 89, 17, 8, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[14, 43, 89, 17, 8, 4]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    array_2 = []
    for i in array:
        if i>0:
            array_2 += [i]
    array_2.sort(reverse=True)
    return array_2
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
