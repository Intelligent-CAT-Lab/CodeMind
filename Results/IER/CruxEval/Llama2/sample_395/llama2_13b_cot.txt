The function f takes a string s as input and returns the index of the first decimal digit in s, or -1 if there are no decimal digits in s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "11", we need to find the index of the first decimal digit in "11".
There are no decimal digits in "11", so the output of executing the function f on the input "11" is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i].isdecimal():
            return i + (s[i] == '0')
        elif s[i] == '0':
            return -1
    return -1
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("11")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
