The function f takes two integers k and j as input and returns a list of j's.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input (7, 5), we need to create a list of 5's and append it to the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input (7, 5) is [5, 5, 5, 5, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(k, j):
    arr = []
    for i in range(k):
        arr.append(j)
    return arr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(7, 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
