The function f takes a string text as input and returns the result of applying the function title() to the input if the input is not in title case, or the result of applying the function lower() to the input if the input is in title case.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "PermissioN is GRANTed", we need to check if the input is in title case.
If the input is in title case, we need to apply the function lower() to the input to return the lowercase version of the input.
If the input is not in title case, we need to apply the function title() to the input to return the title case version of the input.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "PermissioN is GRANTed" is "permission is granted".
<<<Output>>>
'permission is granted'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    if not text.istitle():
        return text.title()
    return text.lower()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("PermissioN is GRANTed")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
