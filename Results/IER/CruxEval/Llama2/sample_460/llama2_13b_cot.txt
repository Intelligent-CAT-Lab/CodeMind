The function f takes two inputs: a string text and an integer amount.
The function returns a string that is the concatenation of the string text and a string that is the result of the following computation:

The length of the string text is calculated using the built-in Python function len().

If the integer amount is greater than or equal to the length of the string text, then the function returns a string that is the result of the following computation:

The string "|" is concatenated with a string that is the result of the following computation:

The integer amount is divided by 2, and the result is converted to a string using the built-in Python function str().

The string "|" is concatenated with the result of the previous computation.

The string "|" is concatenated with the string text.

The string "|" is concatenated with the result of the previous computation.

The function returns the result of the previous computation.

If the integer amount is less than the length of the string text, then the function returns the string text.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, amount):
    length = len(text)
    pre_text = '|'
    if amount >= length:
        extra_space = amount - length
        pre_text +='' * (extra_space // 2)
        return pre_text + text + pre_text
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('GENERAL NAGOOR', 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
