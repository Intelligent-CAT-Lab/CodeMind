The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 4], we need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a list of numbers that is the same length as the input list.
2. For each element in the input list, insert the element's square into the output list at the same index as the element in the input list.
3. Return the output list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 4] is [1, 4, 4, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 4, 4]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        nums.insert(i, nums[i]**2)
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 4])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
