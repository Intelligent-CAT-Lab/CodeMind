The function f takes an array as input and returns the array after performing the following operations:
- Removing all elements from the array that are equal to -1.
- Removing all elements from the array that are equal to 0.
- Removing all elements from the array that are equal to 1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 2], we need to perform the following steps:
- Remove all elements from the array that are equal to -1.
- Remove all elements from the array that are equal to 0.
- Remove all elements from the array that are equal to 1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 2] is [].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    while -1 in array:
        array.pop(-3)
    while 0 in array:
        array.pop()
    while 1 in array:
        array.pop(0)
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([0, 2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
