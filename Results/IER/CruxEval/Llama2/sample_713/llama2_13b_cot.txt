The function f takes a string text and a character char as input.
The function f checks if the character char is present in the string text.
If the character char is present in the string text, the function f splits the string text into a list of strings based on the character char.
The function f then checks if each string in the list has a non-empty value.
If the list of strings has at least one non-empty string, the function f returns True.
Otherwise, the function f returns False.

In this case, the character'' is present in the string 'only one line'.
The function f splits the string 'only one line' into a list of strings based on the character''.
The list of strings is ['only', 'one', 'line'].
The function f checks if each string in the list has a non-empty value.
Since the list of strings has at least one non-empty string, the function f returns True.

Therefore, the return value of the function f on the input 'only one line' and'' is True.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    if char in text:
        text = [t.strip() for t in text.split(char) if t]
        if len(text) > 1:
            return True
    return False
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('only one line','')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
