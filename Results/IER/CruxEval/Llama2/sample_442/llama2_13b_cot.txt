The function f takes a list lst as input and returns a copy of the list.
The function f also iterates over the list and appends the elements of the list to a new list res if the element is even.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4], we need to iterate over the list and append the elements of the list to the new list res if the element is even.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 4] is [2, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 4]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    res = []
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            res.append(lst[i])

    return lst.copy()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3, 4])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
