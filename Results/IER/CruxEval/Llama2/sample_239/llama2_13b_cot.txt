The function f takes a string text and a list of strings froms as input.
The function f first removes any leading characters from text that match any of the strings in froms using the lstrip() method.
Then, the function f removes any trailing characters from text that match any of the strings in froms using the rstrip() method.
Finally, the function f returns the resulting string.

In this case, the input is the string '0 t 1cos ', and the list of strings froms is ['st ', '0\t\n  '].

The function f first removes any leading characters from text that match any of the strings in froms using the lstrip() method.
This means that any characters at the beginning of the string '0 t 1cos'that match any of the strings in froms will be removed.

The function f then removes any trailing characters from text that match any of the strings in froms using the rstrip() method.
This means that any characters at the end of the string '0 t 1cos'that match any of the strings in froms will be removed.

Finally, the function f returns the resulting string.
In this case, the resulting string is '0 t 1cos '.
<<<Output>>>
'0 t 1cos '

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, froms):
    text = text.lstrip(froms)
    text = text.rstrip(froms)
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('0 t 1cos ','st'+ '0\t\n  ')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
