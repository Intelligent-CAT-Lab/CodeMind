The function f takes a string s as input and returns the reversed string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "crew", we need to reverse the string "crew".
The reversed string of "crew" is "wrc".
<<<Output>>>
'wrc'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    r = []
    for i in range(len(s) - 1, 0 - 1, -1):
        r += s[i]
    return ''.join(r)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('crew')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
