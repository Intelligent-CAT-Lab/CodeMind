The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string.
The function f first creates an empty list called chars.
Then, it iterates over the characters in text and appends each character to the list chars if it is a digit.
Finally, the function f returns the string that is the reverse of the string that is the concatenation of the characters in chars.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '--4yrw 251-//4 6p', we need to reverse the string that is the concatenation of the characters in chars.
The string that is the concatenation of the characters in chars is '4yrw 251-//4 6p'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '--4yrw 251-//4 6p' is '4yrw 251-//4 6p'.
<<<Output>>>
'4yrw 251-//4 6p'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    chars = []
    for c in text:
        if c.isdigit():
            chars.append(c)
    return ''.join(chars[::-1])
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('--4yrw 251-//4 6p')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
