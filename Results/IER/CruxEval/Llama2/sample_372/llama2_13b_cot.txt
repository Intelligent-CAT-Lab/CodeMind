The function f takes a list list_ and a number num as input.
The function f creates a new list temp and iterates over the elements of list_.
For each element i in list_, the function f divides num by 2 and appends the result to temp.
The result is a list containing the elements "vv", "vvv", "vvvv", "vvvvv", "vvvvvv", "vvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv", "vvvvvvv
