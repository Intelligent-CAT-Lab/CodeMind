The function f takes a dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary with the same keys as the input dictionary, but with the values of the input dictionary removed if they are also present in the input dictionary.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input dictionary {{-1: -1, 5: 5, 3: 6, -4: -4}}, we need to create a new dictionary with the same keys as the input dictionary, but with the values of the input dictionary removed if they are also present in the input dictionary.

This means that the output dictionary will have the keys {-1, 5, 3, -4}, but the values of these keys will be removed if they are also present in the input dictionary.

Therefore, the output dictionary will have the keys {-1, 5, 3, -4}, but the values of these keys will be removed if they are also present in the input dictionary.

The output dictionary will have the keys {-1, 5, 3, -4}, but the values of these keys will be removed if they are also present in the input dictionary.

The output dictionary will have the keys {-1, 5, 3, -4}, but the values of these keys will be removed if they are also present in the input dictionary.

The output dictionary will have the keys {-1, 5, 3, -4}, but the values of these keys will be removed if they are also present in the input dictionary.

The output dictionary will have the keys {-1, 5, 3, -4}, but the values of these keys will be removed if they are also present in the input dictionary.

The output dictionary will have the keys {-1, 5, 3, -4}, but the values of these keys will be removed if they are also present in the input dictionary.

The output dictionary will have the keys {-1, 5, 3, -4}, but the values of these keys will be removed if they are also present in the input dictionary.

The output dictionary will have the keys {-1, 5, 3, -4}, but the values of these keys will be removed if they are also present in the input dictionary.
