The function f takes a string text as input and returns the number of lines in the string text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ncdsdfdaaa0a1cdscsk*XFd', we need to split the string into lines and count the number of lines.
The string 'ncdsdfdaaa0a1cdscsk*XFd' contains 10 characters, so it will be split into 2 lines.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ncdsdfdaaa0a1cdscsk*XFd' is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    return len(text.splitlines())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ncdsdfdaaa0a1cdscsk*XFd')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
