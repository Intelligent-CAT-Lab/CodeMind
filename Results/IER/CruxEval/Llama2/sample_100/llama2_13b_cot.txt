The function f takes a dictionary d and a list rm as input.
The function f returns a copy of the dictionary d, with any keys that are also in the list rm removed.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ({1: 'a', 1: 'a', 1: 'b', '1': 'b'}, [1]), we need to create a copy of the dictionary d, remove any keys that are also in the list rm, and return the resulting dictionary.

The dictionary d has the keys 1 and '1', and the list rm contains the key 1.
Therefore, the keys 1 and '1' will be removed from the dictionary d, and the resulting dictionary will have the key '1' and the value 'b'.

The output of executing the function f on the input ({1: 'a', 1: 'a', 1: 'b', '1': 'b'}, [1]) is {'1': 'b'}.
<<<Output>>>
{'1': 'b'}

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
