The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The function f iterates over the input array and for each element in the input array, it creates a copy of the element and appends it to a new array.
The function f then returns the new array.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]], we need to iterate over the input array and for each element in the input array, create a copy of the element and append it to a new array.
The output of executing the function f on the input [[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]] is [[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]].
<<<Output>>>
[[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    return_arr = []
    for a in array:
        return_arr.append(a.copy())
    return return_arr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([[1, 2, 3], [], [1, 2, 3]])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
