The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns a list of strings representing the keys and values of the dictionary.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'-4':'4','1':'2','-':'-3'}, we need to iterate over the keys and values of the dictionary and append a string representation of each key-value pair to a list.
The keys of the dictionary are '-4', '1', and '-'.
The values of the dictionary are '4', '2', and '-3'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'-4':'4','1':'2','-':'-3'} is ['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3'].
<<<Output>>>
['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3']

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(d):
    keys = []
    for k in d:
        keys.append('%s => %s' % (k, d[k]))
    return keys
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'-4':'4','1':'2','-':'-3'})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
