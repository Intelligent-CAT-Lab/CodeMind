The function f takes a string text and a character c as input.
It returns a new string by removing the last occurrence of c from text and then joining the remaining characters of text into a single string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'uufhl' and 'l', we need to remove the last occurrence of 'l' from 'uufhl' and then join the remaining characters of 'uufhl' into a single string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'uufhl' and 'l' is 'uufhl'.
<<<Output>>>
'uufhl'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, c):
    ls = list(text)
    if c not in text:
        raise ValueError('Text has no {c}')
    ls.pop(text.rindex(c))
    return ''.join(ls)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('uufhl', 'l')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
