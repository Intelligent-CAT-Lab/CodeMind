The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a character char.
The function returns the index of the last occurrence of the character char in the string text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs "breakfast" and "e", we need to find the index of the last occurrence of the character "e" in the string "breakfast".
The last occurrence of the character "e" in the string "breakfast" is at index 7, so the output of executing the function f on the inputs "breakfast" and "e" is 7.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    return text.rindex(char)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("breakfast", "e")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
