The function f takes two arguments: a list of integers nums and an integer n.
The function returns the value of the nth element of the list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [ -7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4 ] and n = 6, we need to find the value of the 6th element of the list.
The 6th element of the list is -1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [ -7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4 ] and n = 6 is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, n):
    return nums.pop(n)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4], 6)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
