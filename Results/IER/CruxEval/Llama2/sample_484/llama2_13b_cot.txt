The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of strings.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['91', '16', '6r', '5r', 'egr', '', 'f', 'q1f', '-2'], we need to process each item in the input list.

For the first item, '91', we need to check if it is a numeric string.
If it is, we need to convert it to an integer and multiply it by 2.
If it is not a numeric string, we need to append it to the result list in reverse order.

For the second item, '16', we need to check if it is a numeric string.
If it is, we need to convert it to an integer and multiply it by 2.
If it is not a numeric string, we need to append it to the result list in reverse order.

For the third item, '6r', we need to check if it is a numeric string.
If it is, we need to convert it to an integer and multiply it by 2.
If it is not a numeric string, we need to append it to the result list in reverse order.

For the fourth item, '5r', we need to check if it is a numeric string.
If it is, we need to convert it to an integer and multiply it by 2.
If it is not a numeric string, we need to append it to the result list in reverse order.

For the fifth item, 'egr', we need to check if it is a numeric string.
If it is, we need to convert it to an integer and multiply it by 2.
If it is not a numeric string, we need to append it to the result list in reverse order.

For the sixth item, '', we need to check if it is a numeric string.
If it is, we need to convert it to an integer and multiply it by 2.
If it is not a numeric string, we need to append it to the result list in reverse order.

For the seventh item, 'f', we need to check if it is a numeric string.
If it is, we need to convert it to an integer and multiply it by 2.
If it is not a numeric string, we
