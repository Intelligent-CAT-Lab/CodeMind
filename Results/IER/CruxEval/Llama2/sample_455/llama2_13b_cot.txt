The function f takes a string text as input and returns the uppercase version of text if the number of uppercase letters in text is greater than or equal to 10, or returns text otherwise.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '?XyZ', we need to count the number of uppercase letters in '?XyZ' and compare it to 10.

If the number of uppercase letters in '?XyZ' is greater than or equal to 10, then the output of executing the function f on the input '?XyZ' is '?XyZ'.

If the number of uppercase letters in '?XyZ' is less than 10, then the output of executing the function f on the input '?XyZ' is '?XyZ'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '?XyZ' is '?XyZ'.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    return text.upper() if text.isupper() else text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('?XyZ')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string text as input and returns the uppercase version of text if text is uppercase, or returns text otherwise.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '?XyZ', we need to check if '?XyZ' is uppercase.

If '?XyZ' is uppercase, then the output of executing the function f on the input '?XyZ' is '?XyZ'.

If '?XyZ' is not uppercase, then the output of executing the function f
