The function f takes a list m as input and returns the reversed list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list, we need to reverse the list and return the reversed list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list is [-7, 2, -1, 4, 0, -4, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[-7, 2, -1, 4, 0, -4, 6]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(m):
    m.reverse()
    return m
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-4, 6, 0, 4, -7, 2, -1])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
