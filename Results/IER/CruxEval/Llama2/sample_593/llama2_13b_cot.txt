The function f takes two inputs: a list of integers nums and an integer n.
The function f returns a list of integers.

The function f first creates a list of integers with length 14.
Then, it iterates through the list of integers from the end to the beginning, inserting each integer at the end of the list.

Therefore, the return value of the function f on the input [], 14 is a list of integers with length 14, containing the integers from 0 to 13.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>

def f(nums, n):
    pos = len(nums) - 1
    for i in range(-len(nums), 0):
        nums.insert(pos, nums[i])
    return nums

What would be the return value of `f([], 14)`?
