The function f takes a string text and a value as input and returns a string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'bcksrut' and 'q', we need to append the value 'q' to the list of characters in the string 'bcksrut'.
Then, we need to join the list of characters in the string 'bcksrut' with the value 'q' to form a new string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'bcksrut' and 'q' is 'bcksrutq'.
<<<Output>>>
'bcksrutq'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, value):
    text_list = list(text)
    text_list.append(value)
    return ''.join(text_list)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('bcksrut', 'q')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
