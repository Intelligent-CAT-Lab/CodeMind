The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a string to_place.
The function returns a string that is the concatenation of two substrings of text:

- the substring before the first occurrence of to_place in text
- the substring after the first occurrence of to_place in text

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "some text" and "some", we need to find the first occurrence of "some" in "some text".
This occurs at index 5.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "some text" and "some" is "some text" + "some".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, to_place):
    after_place = text[:text.find(to_place, 0) + 1]
    before_place = text[text.find(to_place, 0) + 1:]
    return after_place + before_place
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('some text','some')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
