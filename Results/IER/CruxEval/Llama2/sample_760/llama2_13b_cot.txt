The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns a list of the keys of the dictionary.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input dict(f = 1, h = 2, j = 3, k = 4), we need to iterate through the dictionary and add each key to the list l.
The keys of the dictionary are "f", "h", "j", and "k".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input dict(f = 1, h = 2, j = 3, k = 4) is ["f", "h", "j", "k"].
<<<Output>>>
['f', 'h', 'j', 'k']

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
