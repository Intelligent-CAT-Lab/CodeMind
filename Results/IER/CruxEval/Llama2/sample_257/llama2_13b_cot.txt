The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of lists.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['Hello World\n"I am String"'], we need to split each string in the input list into lines and then create a list of lists, where each list contains the lines of a single string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['Hello World\n"I am String"'] is [['Hello World'], ['I am String']].
<<<Output>>>
[['Hello World'], ['I am String']]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    ls = []
    for x in text:
        ls.append(x.splitlines())
    return ls
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['Hello World\n"I am String"'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
