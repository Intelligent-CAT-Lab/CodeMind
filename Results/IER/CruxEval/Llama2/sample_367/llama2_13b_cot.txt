The function f takes two inputs: a list of integers nums and an integer rmvalue.
The function returns a list of integers.

The function f first creates a copy of the input list nums, which is stored in the variable res.
Then, the function iterates while the input rmvalue is present in the list res.
In each iteration, the function pops the first occurrence of rmvalue from the list res and stores it in the variable popped.
If popped is not equal to rmvalue, the function appends popped back to the list res.

The function returns the list res after all iterations have been completed.

The input nums = [6, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1] and rmvalue = 5.

The first iteration of the while loop removes the first occurrence of 5 from the list res, which is at index 0.
The value of popped is 6, which is not equal to 5, so it is appended back to the list res.

The second iteration of the while loop removes the second occurrence of 5 from the list res, which is at index 1.
The value of popped is 2, which is not equal to 5, so it is appended back to the list res.

The third iteration of the while loop removes the third occurrence of 5 from the list res, which is at index 2.
The value of popped is 1, which is not equal to 5, so it is appended back to the list res.

The fourth iteration of the while loop removes the fourth occurrence of 5 from the list res, which is at index 3.
The value of popped is 1, which is not equal to 5, so it is appended back to the list res.

The fifth iteration of the while loop removes the fifth occurrence of 5 from the list res, which is at index 4.
The value of popped is 4, which is not equal to 5, so it is appended back to the list res.

The function returns the list res after all iterations have been completed, which is [6, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1].
