The function f takes a string text as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string contains only numeric characters.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "03625163633 d", we need to split the string into a list of words, then iterate over the words in the list, and check if each word is numeric.
If any word is not numeric, the function will return "no".
If all words are numeric, the function will return "yes".

To split the string into a list of words, we can use the split() method on the string, which will return a list of words separated by spaces.
To iterate over the words in the list, we can use a for loop.
To check if a word is numeric, we can use the isnumeric() method on the word, which will return True if the word is numeric and False if it is not.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "03625163633 d" is "no".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    text = text.split(' ')
    for t in text:
        if not t.isnumeric():
            return 'no'
    return 'yes'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('03625163633 d')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
