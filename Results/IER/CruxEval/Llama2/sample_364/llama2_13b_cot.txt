The function f takes two arguments: a list of numbers nums and a function verdict.
The function verdict takes a number x as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether x is less than 2.

The function f returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a number and a boolean value indicating whether the number is less than 2.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 3, 0, 1] and the function verdict, we need to:

1. Create a list of numbers that are not equal to 0 from the input list [0, 3, 0, 1]. This list will be used to create the tuples in the output list.
2. Create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a number and a boolean value indicating whether the number is less than 2.
3. If the list of tuples is empty, return the string "error - no numbers or all zeros!". Otherwise, return the list of tuples.
