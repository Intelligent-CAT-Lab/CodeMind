The function f takes two arguments: a string text and a character char.
The function returns True if both the string text and the character char are lowercase.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "abc" and "e", we need to check if both the string "abc" and the character "e" are lowercase.

The string "abc" is lowercase, but the character "e" is not lowercase.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "abc" and "e" is False.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    return char.islower() and text.islower()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('abc', 'e')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
