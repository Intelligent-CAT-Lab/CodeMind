The function f takes a list selfie as input and returns a new list.
The function f iterates through the list selfie from the last element to the first element.
For each element in the list selfie, the function f checks if the element is equal to the first element of the list selfie.
If the element is equal to the first element, the function f removes the last element from the list selfie.
The function f returns the new list selfie.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(selfie):
    lo = len(selfie)
    for i in range(lo-1, -1, -1):
        if selfie[i] == selfie[0]:
            selfie.remove(selfie[lo-1])
    return selfie
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
