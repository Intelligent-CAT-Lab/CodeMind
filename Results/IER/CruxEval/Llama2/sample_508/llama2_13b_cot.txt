The function f takes three arguments: text, sep, and maxsplit.
The text argument is a string that is split using the sep argument and the maxsplit argument.
The sep argument is a string that is used to split the text argument.
The maxsplit argument is an integer that specifies the maximum number of times the text argument should be split.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ertubwi', 'p', 5, we need to split the input string 'ertubwi' using the separator 'p' and the maximum number of splits 5.
This will result in a list of strings, with the first string being 'ertubwi', the second string being 'p', and the third string being 'w'.

Next, we need to reverse the first half of the list of strings and then concatenate it with the second half of the list of strings.
This will result in a new list of strings, with the first string being 'w', the second string being 'p', and the third string being 'ertubwi'.

Finally, we need to join the list of strings using the separator 'p'.
This will result in the output 'wpeertubwi'.
<<<Output>>>
'wpeertubwi'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, sep, maxsplit):
    splitted = text.rsplit(sep, maxsplit)
    length = len(splitted)
    new_splitted = splitted[:length // 2]
    new_splitted.reverse()
    new_splitted += splitted[length // 2:]
    return sep.join(new_splitted)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ertubwi', 'p', 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
