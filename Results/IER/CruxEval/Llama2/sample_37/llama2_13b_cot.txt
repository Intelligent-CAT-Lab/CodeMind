The function f takes a string text as input and returns a list of strings.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '123', we need to split the input string into a list of strings.
The function f uses a for loop to iterate over the characters in the input string, starting at index 0 and ending at the length of the input string.
For each character, the function appends the substring of the input string starting at that character and ending at the end of the input string to the list of strings.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '123' is ['1', '2', '3'].
<<<Output>>>
['1', '2', '3']

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    text_arr = []
    for j in range(len(text)):
        text_arr.append(text[j:])
    return text_arr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('123')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
