The function f takes two strings as input, text and elem.
The function f returns a list containing two strings, elem and text.

The function f first checks if elem is empty. If elem is not empty, it replaces the first occurrence of elem in text with an empty string.
It then checks if text is empty. If text is not empty, it replaces the first occurrence of text in elem with an empty string.

The function f then returns a list containing the two strings elem and text.

The input to the function f is "some" and "1".

The function f first checks if elem is empty. Since elem is not empty, it replaces the first occurrence of elem in text with an empty string.
The function f then checks if text is empty. Since text is not empty, it replaces the first occurrence of text in elem with an empty string.

The function f then returns a list containing the two strings elem and text.

The output of the function f is the list containing the two strings "1" and "some".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, elem):
    if elem!= '':
        while text.startswith(elem):
            text = text.replace(elem, '')
        while elem.startswith(text):
            elem = elem.replace(text, '')
    return [elem, text]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("some", "1")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
