The function f takes a string text as input and returns the number of times the letter "a" appears in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "591237865", we need to count the number of times the letter "a" appears in the string.
The string "591237865" contains the letter "a" once, at the beginning of the string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "591237865" is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    x = 0
    if text.islower():
        for c in text:
            if int(c) in list(range(90)):
                x+=1
    return x
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("591237865")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
