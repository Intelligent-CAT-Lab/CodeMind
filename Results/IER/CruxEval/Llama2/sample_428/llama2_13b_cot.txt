The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [], we need to iterate through the list [], which is empty.
For each iteration, we need to check if the index is even, which is not the case for an empty list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [] is an empty list.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if not i % 2:
            nums.append(nums[i] * nums[i + 1])
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of numbers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to iterate through the list [1, 2, 3].
For each iteration, we need to check if the index is even, which is the case for the first and third elements of the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is the list [1, 2, 6].
<<<Output>>>
