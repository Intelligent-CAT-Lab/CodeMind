The function f takes a string as input and returns the string with the tabs replaced by spaces.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "1  \t\t\t3", we need to replace the tabs in the input with spaces.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "1  \t\t\t3" is "1 3".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    bigTab = 100
    for i in range(10, 30):
        if 0 < string.count('\t') < 20:
            bigTab = i
            break
    return string.expandtabs(bigTab)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('1  \t\t\t3')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
