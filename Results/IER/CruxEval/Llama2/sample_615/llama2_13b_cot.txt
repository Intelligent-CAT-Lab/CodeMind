The function f takes a list in_list and an integer num as input.
It appends num to the list in_list and returns the index of the maximum element in the list in_list[:-1], where in_list[:-1] is a copy of the list in_list with the last element removed.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 12, -6, -2] and -1, we need to append -1 to the list [-1, 12, -6, -2], which results in the list [-1, 12, -6, -2, -1].
Then, we need to find the index of the maximum element in the list [-1, 12, -6, -2, -1], which is 4.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 12, -6, -2] and -1 is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
