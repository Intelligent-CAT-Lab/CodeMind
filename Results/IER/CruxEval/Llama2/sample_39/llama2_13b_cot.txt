The function f takes an array and an element as input and returns the index of the element in the array if the element is present in the array, or -1 otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [6, 2, 7, 1] and the element 6, we need to check if 6 is present in the array.
If 6 is present in the array, we need to return the index of 6 in the array.
If 6 is not present in the array, we need to return -1.

To check if 6 is present in the array, we can use the in operator.
The in operator returns True if the element is present in the array, and False otherwise.

Therefore, we can use the following code to check if 6 is present in the array:

if 6 in [6, 2, 7, 1]:
    return [6, 2, 7, 1].index(6)

If 6 is present in the array, we can use the index operator to return the index of 6 in the array.
The index operator returns the position of the element in the array.

Therefore, we can use the following code to return the index of 6 in the array if 6 is present in the array:

return [6, 2, 7, 1].index(6)

If 6 is not present in the array, we need to return -1.

Therefore, we can use the following code to return -1 if 6 is not present in the array:

return -1

To summarize, we can use the following code to determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [6, 2, 7, 1] and the element 6:

if 6 in [6, 2, 7, 1]:
    return [6, 2, 7, 1].index(6)
return -1

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input array [6, 2, 7, 1] and the element 6 is -1.
