The function f takes a string s as input and returns the sum of the boolean values of whether each word in s is a title.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!", we need to determine whether each word in the input is a title.
The words "SOME", "OF", "THIS", "Is", and "uknowN!" are not titles, so the sum of the boolean values is 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return sum([s.istitle() for s in s.split()])
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('SOME OF THIS Is uknowN!')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
