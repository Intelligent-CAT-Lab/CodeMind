The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string.
The function f iterates through the characters in the input string text and stores them in a list new_text.
For each character in the input string, the function f checks if the character is uppercase.
If the character is uppercase, the function f inserts the character into the list new_text at the index that is half the length of the list.
If the length of the list new_text is 0, the function f inserts the character '-' into the list new_text.
The function f then returns the string that is the concatenation of the characters in the list new_text.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    new_text = []
    for character in text:
        if character.isupper():
            new_text.insert(len(new_text) // 2, character)
    if len(new_text) == 0:
        new_text = ['-']
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('String matching is a big part of RexEx library.')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
