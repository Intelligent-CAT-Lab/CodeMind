The function f takes an array as input and returns a copy of the array with an additional '_' appended to each element.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [], we need to create a copy of the empty array and append an '_' to each element.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [] is ['_'].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    c = array
    array_copy = array

    while True:
        c.append('_')
        if c == array_copy:
            array_copy[c.index('_')] = ''
            break
        
    return array_copy
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
