The function f takes two strings as input: strand and zmnc.
The function f returns the index of the last occurrence of zmnc in strand.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "", we need to find the index of the last occurrence of "abc" in an empty string.
Since there is no occurrence of "abc" in an empty string, the output of executing the function f on the input "" is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    poz = strand.find(zmnc)
    while poz!= -1:
        strand = strand[poz + 1:]
        poz = strand.find(zmnc)
