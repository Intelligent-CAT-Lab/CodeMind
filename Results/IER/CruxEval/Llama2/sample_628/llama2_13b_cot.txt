The function f takes two arguments: a list of integers nums and an integer delete.
The function f removes the integer delete from the list nums and returns the modified list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 5, 3, 6, 1] and delete 5, we need to remove 5 from the list [4, 5, 3, 6, 1] and return the modified list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 5, 3, 6, 1] and delete 5 is [4, 3, 6, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 3, 6, 1]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, delete):
    nums.remove(delete)
    return nums
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([4, 5, 3, 6, 1], 5)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
