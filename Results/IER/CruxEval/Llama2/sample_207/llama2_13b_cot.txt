The function f takes a list of dictionaries as input and returns a dictionary that contains the values from each dictionary.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [{"brown": 2}, {"blue": 5}, {"bright": 4}], we need to create a dictionary that contains the values from each dictionary.
The dictionary will contain the key "brown" with the value 2, the key "blue" with the value 5, and the key "bright" with the value 4.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [{"brown": 2}, {"blue": 5}, {"bright": 4}] is { "brown": 2, "blue": 5, "bright": 4 }.
<<<Output>>>
{ "brown": 2, "blue": 5, "bright": 4 }

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(commands):
    d = {}
    for c in commands:
        d.update(c)
    return d
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([{"brown": 2}, {"blue": 5}, {"bright": 4}])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
