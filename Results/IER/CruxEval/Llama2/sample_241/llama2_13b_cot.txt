The function f takes a string postcode as input and returns the substring of postcode starting from the index of the character 'C' and ending at the end of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'ED20 CW', we need to find the index of the character 'C' in the string 'ED20 CW' and then return the substring starting from that index and ending at the end of the string.
The index of the character 'C' in the string 'ED20 CW' is 4, so the output of executing the function f on the input 'ED20 CW' is 'ED20'.
<<<Output>>>
'ED20'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(postcode):
    return postcode[postcode.index('C'):]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ED20 CW')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
