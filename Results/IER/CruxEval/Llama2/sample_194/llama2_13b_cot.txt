The function f takes a list of lists matr and an integer insert_loc as input.
The function f returns a list of lists by inserting an empty list at the insert_loc location in the list matr.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [[5, 6, 2, 3], [1, 9, 5, 6]], 0), we need to insert an empty list at the 0th location in the list [[5, 6, 2, 3], [1, 9, 5, 6]].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [[5, 6, 2, 3], [1, 9, 5, 6]], 0) is [[], [5, 6, 2, 3], [1, 9, 5, 6]].
<<<Output>>>
[[], [5, 6, 2, 3], [1, 9, 5, 6]]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(matr, insert_loc):
    matr.insert(insert_loc, [])
    return matr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([[5, 6, 2, 3], [1, 9, 5, 6]], 0)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
