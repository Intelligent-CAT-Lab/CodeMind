The function f takes two inputs: a string text and an integer tab_size.
The function returns the string text with all instances of the character '\t' replaced with a string of'' repeated tab_size times.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'a' and tab_size 100, we need to replace all instances of '\t' in 'a' with'' repeated 100 times.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'a' and tab_size 100 is 'a'.
<<<Output>>>
'a'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, tab_size):
    return text.replace('\t',''*tab_size)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('a', 100)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
