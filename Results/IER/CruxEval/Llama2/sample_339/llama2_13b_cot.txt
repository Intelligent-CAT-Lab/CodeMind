The function f takes an array and an element as input and returns the number of times the element appears in the array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2] and element 2, we need to count the number of times the element 2 appears in the array.
The element 2 appears in the array once at index 2, so the output of executing the function f on the input array [-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2] and element 2 is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    elem = str(elem)
    d = 0
    for i in array:
        if str(i) == elem:
            d += 1
    return d
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2], 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
