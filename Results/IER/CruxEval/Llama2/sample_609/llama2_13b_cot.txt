The function f takes two arguments: an array and an element.
The function f returns a dictionary that contains the elements of the input array that are equal to the input element.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array {}, and the input element 1, we need to check if any element in the input array is equal to 1.
If there is an element in the input array that is equal to 1, we need to remove that element from the input array and return the updated input array.
If there is no element in the input array that is equal to 1, we need to return the input array.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input array {} and the input element 1 is the input array {}.
<<<Output>>>
{1}

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    result = array.copy()
    while result:
        key, value = result.popitem()
        if elem == key or elem == value:
            result.update(array)
        del result[key]
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({}, 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
