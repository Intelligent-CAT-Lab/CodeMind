The function f takes a list lst, an integer i, and an integer n as input.
It inserts the integer n at the position i in the list lst and returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input list [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99], the integer 4, and the integer 15, we need to insert the integer 15 at the position 4 in the input list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input list [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99], the integer 4, and the integer 15 is the list [44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99, 15].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst, i, n):
    lst.insert(i, n)
    return lst
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([44, 34, 23, 82, 24, 11, 63, 99], 4, 15)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
