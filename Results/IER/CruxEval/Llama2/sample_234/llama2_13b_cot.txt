The function f takes a string text and a character char as input.
The function returns the position of the character char in the string text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'wduhzxlfk' and 'w', we need to find the position of the character 'w' in the string 'wduhzxlfk'.

The character 'w' is present in the string 'wduhzxlfk' at the position 0.

The position of the character 'w' in the string 'wduhzxlfk' is 0.

The function f returns the position of the character 'w' in the string 'wduhzxlfk', which is 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    position = len(text)
    if char in text:
        position = text.index(char)
        if position > 1:
            position = (position + 1) % len(text)
    return position
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('wduhzxlfk', 'w')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
