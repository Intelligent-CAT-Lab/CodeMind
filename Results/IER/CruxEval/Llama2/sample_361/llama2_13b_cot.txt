The function f takes a string text as input and returns the number of occurrences of the character "#" in the first part of the string text, which is the part before the first ":".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "#! : #!", we need to count the number of occurrences of the character "#" in the first part of the input, which is "#!".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "#! : #!" is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    return text.split(':')[0].count('#')
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("#! : #!")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
