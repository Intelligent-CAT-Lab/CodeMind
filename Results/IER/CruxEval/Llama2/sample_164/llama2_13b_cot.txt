The function f takes a list lst as input and returns a sublist of lst.
The sublist is the first three elements of lst.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 1, 3, 0], we need to sort the input list and then return the first three elements of the sorted list.

The sorted list is [0, 1, 3, 5, 8].
The first three elements of the sorted list are [0, 1, 3].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 1, 3, 0] is [0, 1, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 3]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return lst[0:3]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, 8, 1, 3, 0])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
