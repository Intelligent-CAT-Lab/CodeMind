The function f takes two strings s1 and s2 as input and returns the number of times that s2 appears in s1.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'xinyyexyxx' and 'xx', we need to count the number of times that 'xx' appears in 'xinyyexyxx'.
The first occurrence of 'xx' in 'xinyyexyxx' is at position 1, and the second occurrence is at position 10.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'xinyyexyxx' and 'xx' is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s1, s2):
    position = 1
    count = 0
    while position > 0:
        position = s1.find(s2, position)
        count += 1
        position += 1
    return count
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('xinyyexyxx', 'xx')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
