The function f takes an array and an element as input and returns the array with the element appended to it.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1], [[1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]], we need to append the element [[1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]] to the array [[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1]].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1], [[1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]] is [[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1], [[1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]].
<<<Output>>>
[[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1], [[1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    array.extend(elem)
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1], [[1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
