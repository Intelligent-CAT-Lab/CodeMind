The function f takes a string as input and returns the index of the last occurrence of the letter "e" in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "eeuseeeoehasa", we need to find the index of the last occurrence of the letter "e" in the string.
The letter "e" appears at the index 10 in the string, so the output of executing the function f on the input "eeuseeeoehasa" is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    try:
       return string.rfind('e')
    except AttributeError:
        return "Nuk"
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('eeuseeeoehasa')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
