The function f takes a string text as input and returns the number of alphabetic characters in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'l000*', we need to count the number of alphabetic characters in the string.
The string 'l000*' contains 5 alphabetic characters, so the output of executing the function f on the input 'l000*' is 5.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    counter = 0
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            counter += 1
    return counter
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('l000*',)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
