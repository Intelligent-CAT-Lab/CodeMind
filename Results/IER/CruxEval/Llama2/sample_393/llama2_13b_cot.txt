The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string.
The function f first reverses the string text using the slice operator [::-1].
Then, it creates a new string text2 by iterating over the reversed string ls.
For each iteration, the function f joins the three characters at the current index i with three dashes and then adds the result to the string text2.
Finally, the function f returns the last three characters of the string text2, which are the three dashes.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    ls = text[::-1]
    text2 = ''
    for i in range(len(ls) - 3, 0, -3):
        text2 += '---'.join(ls[i:i + 3]) + '---'
    return text2[:-3]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('scala')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
