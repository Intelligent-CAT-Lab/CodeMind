The function f takes two strings as input: text and sub.
The function returns a list of indices where the string sub is found in the string text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'egmdartoa' and 'good', we need to find the indices where the string 'good' is found in the string 'egmdartoa'.

The string 'good' is found at the indices 1, 4, 7, and 10.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'egmdartoa' and 'good' is [1, 4, 7, 10].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, sub):
    index = []
    starting = 0
    while starting!= -1:
        starting = text.find(sub, starting)
        if starting!= -1:
            index.append(starting)
            starting += len(sub)
    return index
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('egmdartoa', 'good')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
