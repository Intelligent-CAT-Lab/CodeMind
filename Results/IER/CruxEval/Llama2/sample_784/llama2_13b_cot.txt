The function f takes two arguments, key and value.
The function creates a dictionary with the key "read" and the value "Is".
The function then returns the key-value pair from the dictionary.

The return value of the function f on the input "read", "Is" is the key-value pair "read", "Is".
<<<Output>>>
('read', 'Is')

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(key, value):
    dict_ = {key: value}
    return dict.popitem(dict_)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('read', 'Is')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
