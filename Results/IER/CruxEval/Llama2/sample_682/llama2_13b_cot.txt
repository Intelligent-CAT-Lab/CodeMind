The function f takes three arguments: text, length, and index.
The text argument is a string that is split into a list of strings using the index argument as the separator.
The length argument specifies the maximum number of characters to include in each resulting string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'hypernimovichyp', length 2, and index 2, we need to split the string 'hypernimovichyp' at the index 2 and then join the resulting list of strings using the '_' character.

The output of executing the function f on the input 'hypernimovichyp', length 2, and index 2 is 'hyp_'.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, length, index):
    ls = text.rsplit(None, index)
    return '_'.join([l[:length] for l in ls])
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('hypernimovichyp', 2, 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
