The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a list new_ending.
The function f returns a string by concatenating the characters in the string text with the characters in the list new_ending.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "jro" and the input "wdlp", we need to concatenate the characters in "jro" with the characters in "wdlp".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "jro" and the input "wdlp" is "jrowdpl".
<<<Output>>>
'jrowdpl'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, new_ending):
    result = list(text)
    result.extend(new_ending)
    return ''.join(result)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('jro', 'wdlp')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
