The function f takes two inputs: a string s and a string x.
The function f returns a string s that is the result of processing the input string s using the following steps:

1. Initialize a variable count to 0.
2. While the substring s[:len(x)] of s is equal to x and the value of count is less than the length of s minus the length of x, do the following:
    - Substring s[:len(x)] of s is equal to x:
        - The substring s[:len(x)] of s is the substring of s that starts at the beginning of s and has a length of len(x).
        - The string x is the input string x.
    - The value of count is less than the length of s minus the length of x:
        - The value of count is less than the length of s minus the length of x because the substring s[:len(x)] of s is equal to x and the value of count is less than the length of s minus the length of x.
    - Substring s[:len(x)] of s is equal to x and the value of count is less than the length of s minus the length of x:
        - The substring s[:len(x)] of s is the substring of s that starts at the beginning of s and has a length of len(x).
        - The value of count is less than the length of s minus the length of x because the substring s[:len(x)] of s is equal to x and the value of count is less than the length of s minus the length of x.
    - Substring s[:len(x)] of s is equal to x and the value of count is less than the length of s minus the length of x:
        - The substring s[:len(x)] of s is the substring of s that starts at the beginning of s and has a length of len(x).
        - The value of count is less than the length of s minus the length of x because the substring s[:len(x)] of s is equal to x and the value of count is less than the length of s minus the length of x.
3. Substring s[:len(x)] of s is equal to x and the value of count is less than the length of s minus the length of x:
