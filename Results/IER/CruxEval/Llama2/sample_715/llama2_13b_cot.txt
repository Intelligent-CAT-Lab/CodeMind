The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a character char.
The function returns True if the number of occurrences of the character char in the string text is odd, and False otherwise.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "abababac" and the character "a", we need to count the number of occurrences of the character "a" in the string "abababac".
The number of occurrences of the character "a" in the string "abababac" is 4.
Since 4 is odd, the output of executing the function f on the input "abababac" and the character "a" is True.
<<<Output>>>
True

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    return text.count(char) % 2!= 0
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('abababac', 'a')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
