The function f takes a string title as input and returns the lowercase version of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "   Rock   Paper   SCISSORS  ", we need to convert the string to lowercase.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "   Rock   Paper   SCISSORS  " is "rock paper scissors".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(title):
    return title.lower()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('   Rock   Paper   SCISSORS  ')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
