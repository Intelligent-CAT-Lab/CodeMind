The function f takes a string text as input and returns True if the string is lowercase, and False otherwise.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "54882", we need to check if the string is lowercase.
Since "54882" is not lowercase, the output of executing the function f on the input "54882" is False.
<<<Output>>>
False

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    if text.islower():
        return True
    return False
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("54882")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
