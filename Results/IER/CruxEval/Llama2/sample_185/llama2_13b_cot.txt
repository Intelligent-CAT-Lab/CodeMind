The function f takes a list L as input and returns a sorted list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [16, 14, 12, 7, 9, 11], we need to sort the input list.
The input list is [16, 14, 12, 7, 9, 11].
The first element of the input list is 16.
The second element of the input list is 14.
The third element of the input list is 12.
The fourth element of the input list is 7.
The fifth element of the input list is 9.
The sixth element of the input list is 11.

The first element of the input list is less than the second element of the input list.
Therefore, we swap the first and second elements of the input list.
The input list is now [14, 16, 12, 7, 9, 11].

The second element of the input list is less than the third element of the input list.
Therefore, we swap the second and third elements of the input list.
The input list is now [14, 12, 16, 7, 9, 11].

The third element of the input list is less than the fourth element of the input list.
Therefore, we swap the third and fourth elements of the input list.
The input list is now [14, 12, 16, 7, 9, 11].

The fourth element of the input list is less than the fifth element of the input list.
Therefore, we swap the fourth and fifth elements of the input list.
The input list is now [14, 12, 16, 7, 9, 11].

The fifth element of the input list is less than the sixth element of the input list.
Therefore, we swap the fifth and sixth elements of the input list.
The input list is now [14, 12, 16, 7, 9, 11].

The input list is now sorted.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input
