The function f takes a list mylist as input and returns True if the list mylist is equal to the reversed list revl.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8], we need to compare the list [5, 8] with the reversed list [8, 5].
Since the list [5, 8] is not equal to the reversed list [8, 5], the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8] is False.
<<<Output>>>
False

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(mylist):
    revl = mylist[:]
    revl.reverse()
    mylist.sort(reverse=True)
    return mylist == revl
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, 8])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
