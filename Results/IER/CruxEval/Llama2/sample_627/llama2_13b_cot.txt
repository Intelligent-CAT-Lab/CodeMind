The function f takes a list of tuples as input and returns a list of the values of the tuples.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [('u', 1), ('s', 7), ('u', -5)], we need to extract the values from each tuple in the input list.
The values of the tuples in the input list are 1, 7, and -5.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [('u', 1), ('s', 7), ('u', -5)] is [1, 7, -5].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 7, -5]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(parts):
    return list(dict(parts).values())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([('u', 1), ('s', 7), ('u', -5)])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
