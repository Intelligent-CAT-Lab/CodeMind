The function f takes a string text as input and returns the index of the first empty line in the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "2 m2 \n\nbike", we need to split the input into a list of lines using the splitlines() method.
Then, we need to iterate over the list of lines and check if the length of each line is 0.
If we find a line with a length of 0, we return the index of that line.
If we do not find a line with a length of 0, we return -1.

To split the input into a list of lines, we can use the splitlines() method.
This method takes a string as input and returns a list of strings, where each string is a line in the input.
For example, if we have the input "2 m2 \n\nbike", we can use the splitlines() method to split it into a list of lines like this:

lines = "2 m2 \n\nbike".splitlines()

This will return a list of strings, where each string is a line in the input.

To iterate over the list of lines, we can use a for loop.
For example, we can use a for loop to iterate over the list of lines and check if the length of each line is 0.

for j in k:
    if len(j) == 0:
        return i

This will return the index of the first empty line in the input "2 m2 \n\nbike".
