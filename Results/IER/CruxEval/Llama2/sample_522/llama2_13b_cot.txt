The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of floats.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input range(100, 120), we need to convert each number in the range to a float and then check if 1 is in the list of floats.
If 1 is in the list of floats, the function returns the list of floats.
If 1 is not in the list of floats, the function returns an empty list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input range(100, 120) is [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9].
<<<Output>>>
[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
