The function f takes an array and an element as input and returns the index of the element in the array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input array [5, -3, 3, 2] and the element 2, we need to find the index of 2 in the array.
The index of 2 in the array is 2, so the output of executing the function f on the input array [5, -3, 3, 2] and the element 2 is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    array.reverse()
    try:
        found = array.index(elem)
    finally:
        array.reverse()
    return found
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, -3, 3, 2], 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
