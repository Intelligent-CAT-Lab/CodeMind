The function f takes a string text as input and returns the sum of the lengths of the substrings of text that are separated by a character that is not the same as the character at index i.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'wdj', we need to calculate the sum of the lengths of the substrings of 'wdj' that are separated by a character that is not the same as the character at index i.
The substrings of 'wdj' that are separated by a character that is not the same as the character at index i are 'w', 'dj', and ''.
The lengths of these substrings are 2, 1, and 0, respectively.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'wdj' is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, len(text)):
        s += len(text.rpartition(text[i])[0])
    return s
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('wdj')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
