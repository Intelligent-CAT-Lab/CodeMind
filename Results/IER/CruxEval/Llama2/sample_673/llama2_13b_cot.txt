The function f takes a string as input and returns the string in lowercase if it is uppercase, or the string in uppercase if it is lowercase.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "cA", we need to check if the string is uppercase or lowercase.

If the string is uppercase, we need to convert it to lowercase and return it.
If the string is lowercase, we need to convert it to uppercase and return it.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "cA" is "ca".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    if string.isupper():
        return string.lower()
    elif string.islower():
        return string.upper()
    return string
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("cA")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
