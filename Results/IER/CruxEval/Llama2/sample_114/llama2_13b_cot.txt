The function f takes two arguments: text and sep.
The text argument is a string that is split using the sep argument, which is also a string.
The maxsplit argument is used to specify the maximum number of splits to perform.

In this case, the text argument is "a-.-.b" and the sep argument is "-.".
The function f will split the text argument using the sep argument, resulting in a list of strings.
The maxsplit argument is used to specify the maximum number of splits to perform, which in this case is 2.

The output of the function f on the input "a-.-.b" and sep argument "-." is a list of two strings, which are "a" and "b".
<<<Output>>>
['a', 'b']

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, sep):
    return text.rsplit(sep, maxsplit=2)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("a-.-.b", "-.")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
