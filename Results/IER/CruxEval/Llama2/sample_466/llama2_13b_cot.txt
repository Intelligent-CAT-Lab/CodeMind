The function f takes a string text as input and returns a substring of text.
The function f first determines the length of the input string text.
Then, it sets the index to 0 and iterates while the index is less than the length of the input string and the character at the index is a whitespace character.
This will skip the leading whitespace characters in the input string.
Finally, the function f returns the substring of text starting at index and ending at index+5.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '-----\t\n\tth\n-----', we need to determine the index of the first non-whitespace character in the input string.
This index is 10, as the first non-whitespace character is 't' at index 10.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '-----\t\n\tth\n-----' is 'th'.

'th'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    length = len(text)
    index = 0
    while index < length and text[index].isspace():
        index += 1
    return text[index:index+5]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('-----\t\n\tth\n-----')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
