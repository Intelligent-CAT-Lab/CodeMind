The function f takes a string text as input and returns the concatenation of the last character of text with the substring of text that is everything except the last character.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'hellomyfriendear', we need to concatenate the last character of 'hellomyfriendear' with the substring of 'hellomyfriendear' that is everything except the last character.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'hellomyfriendear' is 'hellomyfriendear'.
<<<Output>>>
'hellomyfriendear'

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    return text[-1] + text[:-1]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('hellomyfriendear')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
