The function f takes three arguments: an array, an integer, and an element.
The array is a list of integers, and the integer is the index at which the element should be inserted.
The element is the integer that should be inserted at the specified index.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [ -4,   1,  0], 1, 4), we need to insert the integer 4 at the index 1 in the array [ -4,   1,  0].
This results in the array [ -4,   1,  4,  0].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [ -4,   1,  0], 1, 4) is [ -4,   1,  4,  0].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, i_num, elem):
    array.insert(i_num, elem)
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([ -4,   1,  0], 1, 4)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
