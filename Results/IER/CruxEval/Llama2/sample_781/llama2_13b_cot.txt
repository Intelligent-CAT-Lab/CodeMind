The function f takes a string s and a character ch as input.
The function returns an empty string if the character ch is not present in the string s.
Otherwise, the function slices the string s into three parts using the character ch as the delimiter.
The function then reverses the second part of the string and returns it.

The function then iterates over the string s, slicing it into three parts using the character ch as the delimiter.
For each iteration, the function reverses the second part of the string and returns it.

The function returns the reversed string s.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, ch):
    if ch not in s:
        return ''
    s = s.partition(ch)[2][::-1]
    for i in range(len(s)):
        s = s.partition(ch)[2][::-1]
    return s
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('shivajimonto6', '6')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
