The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of numbers.
The function f first clears the list nums, which means that it removes all elements from the list.
Then, for each element in the list nums, the function f multiplies the element by 2 and adds it to the list nums.
Finally, the function f returns the list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2], we need to follow the steps outlined above.
First, we clear the list nums, which means that we remove all elements from the list.
Then, for each element in the list nums, we multiply the element by 2 and add it to the list nums.
Finally, we return the list nums.

The output of executing the function f on the input [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2] is [8, 6, 4, 2, 4, -2, 8, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[8, 6, 4, 2, 4, -2, 8, 4]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
