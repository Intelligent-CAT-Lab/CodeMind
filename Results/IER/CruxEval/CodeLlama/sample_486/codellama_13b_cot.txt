<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary with the same keys but with the values squared.
The code first makes a copy of the input dictionary using the copy() method.
The code then iterates over the items in the dictionary using the items() method.
For each key-value pair, the code squares the value and assigns it to the corresponding key in the new dictionary.
The code then returns the new dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
