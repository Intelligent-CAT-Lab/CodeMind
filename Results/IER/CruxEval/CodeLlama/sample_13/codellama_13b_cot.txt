The variable names is initialized to ['sharron', 'Savannah', 'Mike Cherokee'].
The variable count is initialized to the length of names, which is 3.
The variable numberOfNames is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of names that meet the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of names.
For each element i in names, it checks if i is a string that contains only letters (using the isalpha() method). If it is, it adds 1 to numberOfNames.
The condition is met when i is 'sharron' and 'Savannah', but not when i is 'Mike Cherokee' because it contains a space.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of numberOfNames, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
