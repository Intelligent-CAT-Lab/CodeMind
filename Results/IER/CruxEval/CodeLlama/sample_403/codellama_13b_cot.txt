<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, full and part.
The length of part is calculated and stored in the variable length.
The index of the first occurrence of part in full is found using the find() method.
The variable count is initialized to 0.
The while loop starts by checking if index is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, the loop continues.
The full string is sliced from index + length to the end of the string.
The index of the next occurrence of part in the sliced string is found using the find() method.
The count variable is incremented by 1.
The loop continues until index is less than 0.
The function returns the final value of count.

In this case, the string 'hrsiajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy' contains the substring 'hr' 3 times.
