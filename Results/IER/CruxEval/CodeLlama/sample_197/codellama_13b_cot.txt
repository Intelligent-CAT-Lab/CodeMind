<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, temp and timeLimit.
The variable temp is initialized to 1, and timeLimit is initialized to 1234567890.
The code then calculates the quotient of timeLimit and temp, which is 1234567890 // 1 = 1234567890.
The code then calculates the remainder of timeLimit and temp, which is 1234567890 % 1 = 0.
The code then returns a list with two elements, where the first element is the string representation of the remainder, which is "0 oC", and the second element is the string representation of the quotient, which is "1234567890 0".
The code returns the second element of the list, which is "1234567890 0".
<<<Output>>>
"1234567890 0"
