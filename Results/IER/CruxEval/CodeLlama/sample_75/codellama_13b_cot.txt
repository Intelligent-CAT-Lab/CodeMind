<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an array and an element.
The function first finds the index of the element in the array using the index() method.
The function then returns the product of the index and 2, plus the product of the element at the last index of the array and 3.

In this case, the array is [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2] and the element is 2.
The index of 2 in the array is 1, so the function returns (1 * 2) + (2 * 3) = 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
