<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: input_string and spaces.
The input_string is a string with a tab character in it.
The spaces argument is an integer that specifies the number of spaces to replace the tab character with.
The function returns the input_string with the tab character replaced with spaces.

The code uses the expandtabs() method of the string object to replace the tab character with spaces. The method takes a single argument, which is the number of spaces to replace the tab character with.

In this case, the input_string is 'a\tb', which is a string with a tab character in it. The spaces argument is 4, which means the tab character should be replaced with 4 spaces.

The return value of the function is the input_string with the tab character replaced with 4 spaces, which is 'a    b'.
<<<Output>>>
'a    b'
