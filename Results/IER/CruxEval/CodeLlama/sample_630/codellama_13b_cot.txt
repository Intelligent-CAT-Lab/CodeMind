<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: original and string.
original is a dictionary with keys 1 and 0, and values -9 and -7, respectively.
string is a dictionary with keys 1 and 0, and values 2 and 3, respectively.
The function creates a copy of the original dictionary and stores it in temp.
It then iterates over the items in string and updates the values in temp with the corresponding keys.
For example, the value of temp[2] is updated to -9, and the value of temp[3] is updated to -7.
Finally, the function returns the updated temp dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{2: -9, 3: -7}
