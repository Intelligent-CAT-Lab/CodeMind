<<<Analysis>>>
The variable nums is initialized to [-7, 3, 1, -1, -1, 0, 4], and variable n is initialized to 6.
The code then calls the pop() method on the list nums, which removes and returns the element at index 6.
Since the list nums has 7 elements, the index 6 is out of range, and the code will raise an IndexError.
<<<Output>>>
IndexError
