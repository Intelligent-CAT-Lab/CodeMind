<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string argument, text, and returns a string.
The function first splits the string into three parts using the rpartition method, which splits the string at the last occurrence of the character '0'.
The function then checks if the third part of the split string is empty. If it is, the function returns the string '-1:-1'.
If the third part is not empty, the function returns a string in the format '{len(l[0])}:{l[2].find("0") + 1}'.
The len(l[0]) part of the string is the length of the first part of the split string, which is the part before the last occurrence of '0'.
The l[2].find("0") + 1 part of the string is the index of the first occurrence of '0' in the third part of the split string, plus 1.
<<<Output>>>
'3:4'
