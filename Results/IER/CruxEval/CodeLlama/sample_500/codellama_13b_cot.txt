<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and delim.
The code first reverses the string text using the slice notation [::-1].
It then finds the first occurrence of the delimiter delim in the reversed string using the find method.
The code then slices the reversed string from the beginning to the position of the delimiter, and then reverses the resulting string using the slice notation [::-1] again.
The final result is the reversed string with the delimiter removed.

In this case, the input text is 'dsj osq wi w' and the delimiter is ' '.
The reversed string is 'w iw osq jds'.
The first occurrence of the delimiter ' ' is at position 4.
The resulting string is 'w iw osq'.
The final result is 'w iw osq'.
<<<Output>>>
'w iw osq'
