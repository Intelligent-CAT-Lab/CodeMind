<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and num_digits.
The function first calculates the width of the string to be returned, which is the maximum of 1 and num_digits.
The function then returns the text argument, padded with zeros to the left, up to the width calculated.
In this case, the width is 5, so the function returns the string '19' padded with 3 zeros to the left, resulting in the string '00019'.
<<<Output>>>
'00019'
