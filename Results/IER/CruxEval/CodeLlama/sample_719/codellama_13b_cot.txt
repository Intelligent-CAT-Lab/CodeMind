<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and splits it into lines using the ']' character as a delimiter.
It then initializes an empty list called result and a variable called level to 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over each line in the lines list.
For each line, it appends the first character of the line to the result list, followed by a space and the level variable number of spaces.
It then appends the remaining characters of the line to the result list.
The level variable is updated by adding the number of '{' characters in the line minus the number of '}' characters.
Finally, the function returns the result list joined together with newlines.

<<<Output>>>
if (x) {y = 1;} else {z = 1;}
