<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: text and char.
The function splits the text into a list of words using the char argument as the delimiter.
The function then joins the list of words back into a string using a space as the delimiter.
The function returns the resulting string.

In this case, the text argument is 'a' and the char argument is 'a'.
The function splits the text into a list of words, which is an empty list.
The function then joins the list of words back into a string using a space as the delimiter, resulting in an empty string.

Therefore, the return value of the function is an empty string.
