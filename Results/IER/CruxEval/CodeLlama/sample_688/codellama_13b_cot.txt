<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input.
The function creates an empty list l and then iterates through the input list nums.
For each number i in nums, the function checks if i is already in l. If it is not, it appends i to l.
The function then returns l.

In this case, the input list nums is [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8].
The function iterates through the list and appends each number to l if it is not already in l.
The final value of l is [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 8], which is returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
[3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 8]
