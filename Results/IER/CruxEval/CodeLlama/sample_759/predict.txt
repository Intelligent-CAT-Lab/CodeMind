The function f takes two arguments: text and sub.
The function first initializes an empty list called index.
The function then sets starting to 0.
The function enters a while loop that iterates until starting is equal to -1.
The loop first calls the find method of the text argument with the sub argument and the starting argument as parameters.
The loop then checks if starting is not equal to -1.
If starting is not equal to -1, the loop appends starting to the index list and sets starting to the sum of starting and the length of the sub argument.
The loop then increments starting by 1.
The loop repeats until starting is equal to -1.
The function then returns the index list.

The input text is 'egmdartoa' and the input sub is 'good'.
The function first finds the first occurrence of 'good' in the text, which is at index 1.
The function then appends 1 to the index list.
