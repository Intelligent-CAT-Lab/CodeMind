The function takes a string argument s.
The code first splits the string into three parts using the rpartition method.
The left variable will contain the part of the string to the left of the last occurrence of the separator, which is a dot in this case.
The sep variable will contain the separator, which is a dot in this case.
The right variable will contain the part of the string to the right of the last occurrence of the separator, which is a dot in this case.
The code then joins the right and left variables using the separator, which results in a new string.
The code then splits the new string into three parts using the rpartition method.
The left variable will contain the part of the string to the left of the last occurrence of the separator, which is a dot in this case.
The sep variable will contain the separator, which is a dot in this case.
The right variable will contain the part of the string to the right of the last occurrence of the separator, which is a dot in this case.
The code then returns the new string, which is the original string with the separator replaced by a comma and a space.
