<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input.
The code first sorts the dictionary by key in descending order using the sorted() function.
The key1 is assigned the first key in the sorted dictionary, which is 87.
The value associated with key1 is popped from the dictionary and assigned to val1.
The code then repeats the same process to find the second key and value.
The key2 is assigned the second key in the sorted dictionary, which is 18.
The value associated with key2 is popped from the dictionary and assigned to val2.
The code then returns a new dictionary with the keys key1 and key2 and their corresponding values val1 and val2.
<<<Output>>>
{87: 7, 18: 6}
