The function f takes two arguments: text and sep.
The text argument is a string, and the sep argument is a string that separates the text into substrings.
The function returns a list of substrings, where each substring is separated by the sep argument.
The rsplit method is used to split the text into substrings, and the maxsplit argument is set to 2 to indicate that only two splits should be made.
The return value of the function is a list of substrings, where each substring is separated by the sep argument.
