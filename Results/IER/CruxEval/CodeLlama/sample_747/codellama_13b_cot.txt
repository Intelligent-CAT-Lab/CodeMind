<<<Analysis>>>
The code checks if the input text is equal to '42.42', which it is not.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 3 to the length of the text minus 3.
For each iteration, the code checks if the character at the current index is a period (.), if the substring from the current index to the end of the text is a digit, and if the substring from the beginning of the text to the current index is a digit.
Since the text "123E-10" does not contain a period, the loop does not execute and the code returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
