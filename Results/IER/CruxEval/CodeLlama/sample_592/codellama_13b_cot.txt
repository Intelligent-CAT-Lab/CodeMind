<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input.
The code first initializes an empty list new_numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the input list numbers.
For each number i in the list, the code appends the last element of the list numbers to new_numbers.
The code repeats this process for each element in the list numbers.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of new_numbers, which is [3, 11].
<<<Output>>>
[3, 11]
