<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments, s and sep.
The variable s is initialized to 'volume' and sep is initialized to 'l'.
The code then splits the string s into a list of substrings using the separator sep.
The list of substrings is then reversed and a new list is created by adding a '*' character to the beginning of each substring.
The new list is then joined using the ';' character and returned.

The return value of the function will be '*volume;*l'.
<<<Output>>>
*volume;*l
