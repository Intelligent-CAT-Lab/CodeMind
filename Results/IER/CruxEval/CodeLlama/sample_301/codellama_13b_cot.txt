<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of integers as input, and returns the same list with some modifications.
The code first calculates the length of the input list using the len() function and stores it in the variable count.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from -count+1 to 0 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code extends the input list by appending two copies of the element at index i to the end of the list.
The code then returns the modified list.

Based on the analysis, the return value of the code will be [0, 6, 2, -1, -2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 2, 2, -1, -1, -2, -2].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 6, 2, -1, -2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 2, 2, -1, -1, -2, -2]
