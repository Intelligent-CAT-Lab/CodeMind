<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and comparison.
The length of comparison is calculated and stored in the variable length.
The function then checks if length is less than or equal to the length of text.
If it is, the function enters a loop that iterates from 0 to length.
For each iteration, the function checks if the character at the same position in comparison is not equal to the character at the same position in text.
If the condition is met, the function returns the current value of i.
If the loop finishes without returning, the function returns the value of length.
