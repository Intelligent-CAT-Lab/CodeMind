<<<Analysis>>>
The variable letters is initialized to "dp ef1 gh2".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string letters.
For each character l in this range, it checks if l is a digit using the isdigit() method.
If l is a digit, it increments the variable count by 1.
The loop finishes and the code returns the final value of count, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
