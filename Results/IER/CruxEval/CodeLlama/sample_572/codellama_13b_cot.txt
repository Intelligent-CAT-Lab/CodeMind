<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: data, which is a dictionary, and num, which is an integer.
The function creates a new dictionary called new_dict and initializes it to an empty dictionary.
It then creates a list called temp that contains the items of the dictionary data.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from len(temp) - 1 to num - 1 in reverse order.
For each iteration, the code adds the current item to new_dict with a value of None.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the items of new_dict followed by the items of temp starting from the index num.

Based on the analysis, the return value of f({1: 9, 2: 10, 3: 1}, 1) would be [3: 1, 2: 10, 1: 9].
<<<Output>>>
[3: 1, 2: 10, 1: 9]
