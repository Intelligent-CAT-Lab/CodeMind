<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: nums and val.
nums is a list of numbers, and val is an integer.
The function creates a new list called new_list and initializes it to an empty list.
The function then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of nums and extend new_list with each element repeated val times.
For example, if nums is [10, 4] and val is 3, new_list will be [10, 10, 10, 4, 4, 4].
The function then returns the sum of the elements in new_list.
