<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: integer and n.
The variable integer is initialized to 8999, and the variable n is initialized to 2.
The code then converts the integer to a string using the str() function.
The code then enters a loop that iterates while the condition (i+len(text) < n) is true.
The variable i is initialized to 1, and the variable text is initialized to the string representation of the integer.
The loop increments i by the length of the text variable, which is 4 in this case.
The loop continues until i+len(text) is greater than or equal to n, which is 2 in this case.
The loop exits when i+len(text) is greater than or equal to n.
The code then returns the text variable, which is "8999" in this case.
<<<Output>>>
"8999"
