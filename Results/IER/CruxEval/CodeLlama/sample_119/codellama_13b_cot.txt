<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to "vsnlygltaw".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of text (which is 10).
For each iteration, it checks if the current index i is even (i.e., i % 2 == 0).
If it is, it swaps the case of the character at the current index and appends it to the result string.
If it is not, it simply appends the character at the current index to the result string.
The loop finishes and the code returns the final value of result, which is "VsNlYgLtAw".
<<<Output>>>
VsNlYgLtAw
