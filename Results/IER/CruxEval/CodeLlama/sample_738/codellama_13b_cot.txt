<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and characters.
The function first iterates over the characters in the string characters, and for each character, it removes all occurrences of that character from the end of the string text.
The function then returns the modified string text.

In this case, the function is called with the arguments "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r" and "x.r".
The function iterates over the characters in "x.r", which are "x" and "r".
For each character, it removes all occurrences of that character from the end of the string "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r".
The resulting string is "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r".

Therefore, the return value of the function is "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r".
<<<Output>>>
"r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r"
