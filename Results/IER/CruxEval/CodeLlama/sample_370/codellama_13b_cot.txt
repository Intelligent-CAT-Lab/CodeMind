<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string argument text.
The function iterates through each character in the string using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if the character is a space using the isspace() method.
If the character is not a space, the function returns False.
If the character is a space, the function continues to the next character.
If the function reaches the end of the string without returning False, it returns True.

In this case, the string '     i' has 5 spaces and one letter 'i'.
The function will iterate through each character in the string and check if it is a space.
Since the first 5 characters are spaces, the function will return False.
The function will not return True because it has not reached the end of the string.

<<<Output>>>
False
