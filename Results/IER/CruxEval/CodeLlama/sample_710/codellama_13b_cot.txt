<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: playlist, liker_name, and song_index.
The playlist argument is a dictionary that maps usernames to lists of song indices.
The liker_name argument is a string that represents the username of the person who liked the song.
The song_index argument is an integer that represents the index of the song in the playlist.
The function first retrieves the list of liked songs for the given username using the get method.
If the username is not in the dictionary, it returns an empty list.
The function then appends the song index to the list of liked songs for the given username.
Finally, the function returns the updated playlist.
<<<Output>>>
