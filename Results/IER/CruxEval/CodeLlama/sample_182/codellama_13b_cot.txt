The function f takes a dictionary as input and returns a sorted list of its key-value pairs.
The sorted function is called with the argument dic.items(), which returns a list of tuples containing the dictionary's keys and values.
The key argument of the sorted function is a lambda function that takes each tuple as input and returns the first element of the tuple (i.e., the key).
The sorted function sorts the list of tuples based on the first element of each tuple, which is the key.
The return value of the function is a sorted list of key-value pairs.
