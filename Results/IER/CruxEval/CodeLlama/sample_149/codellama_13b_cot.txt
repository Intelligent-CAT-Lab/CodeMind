<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: tuple_list, which is a tuple of integers, and joint, which is a string.
The function creates an empty string called string.
It then iterates over the elements of tuple_list using a for loop.
For each element num in tuple_list, it creates a dictionary using the fromkeys() method.
The dictionary has the key as the string representation of num, and the value is joint multiplied by the length of the string representation of num.
The dictionary is then popped, which returns the last item in the dictionary.
The last item is a tuple with two elements: the key and the value.
The key is concatenated to the string, and joint is concatenated to the string.
The loop continues until all elements in tuple_list have been processed.
The final value of string is returned.
