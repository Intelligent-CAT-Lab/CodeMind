The variable single_digit is initialized to 5.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number c in this range, it checks if c is not equal to single_digit (which is 5 in this case). If it is not, it appends c to the result list. The condition is met when c is 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 and 10.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of result, which is [1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10].
<<<Output>>>
[1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10]
