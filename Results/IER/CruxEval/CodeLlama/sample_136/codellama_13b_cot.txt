<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: text and width.
The text argument is a string with newline characters, and the width argument is an integer.
The function splits the text into lines using the split() method with the newline character as the separator.
The lines are then centered using the center() method with the width argument as the width of the centered text.
The centered lines are then joined using the join() method with the newline character as the separator.
The function returns the final string.
