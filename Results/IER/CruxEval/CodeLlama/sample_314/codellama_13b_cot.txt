<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and returns a string as output.
The function first checks if the input string contains a comma. If it does, it splits the string into three parts using the partition method. The first part is the text before the comma, the second part is the comma itself, and the third part is the text after the comma.
The function then returns the concatenation of the third part, a space, and the first part.
If the input string does not contain a comma, the function returns a string that starts with a comma, followed by the last word in the input string, and ends with a space and the number 0.
<<<Output>>>
'105, 244 -90'
