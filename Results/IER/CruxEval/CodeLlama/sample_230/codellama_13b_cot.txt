<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to '102x0zoq'.
The variable result is initialized to an empty string.
The variable i is initialized to the length of text minus 1, which is 8.
The code enters a loop that iterates from i to 0 (inclusive).
For each iteration, it retrieves the character at position i in the string text and stores it in variable c.
The code checks if c is an alphabetic character (i.e., if c.isalpha() returns True). If it is, it appends c to the end of the string result.
The loop continues until i reaches 0, at which point the code returns the final value of result, which is 'zoq'.
<<<Output>>>
'zoq'
