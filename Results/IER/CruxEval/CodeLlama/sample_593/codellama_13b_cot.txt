<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: nums, a list of numbers, and n, an integer.
The function first initializes pos to the length of nums minus 1, which is 0 in this case.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from -len(nums) to 0, which is -14 to 0.
For each iteration, the code inserts the element at position i in nums into position pos in nums.
Since nums is initially an empty list, the loop does not execute and the function returns an empty list.
