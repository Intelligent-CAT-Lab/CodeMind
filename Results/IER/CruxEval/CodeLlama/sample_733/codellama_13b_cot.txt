<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string argument text.
The length of the string is calculated by dividing the length of the string by 2.
The left half of the string is obtained by slicing the string from the beginning to the middle.
The right half of the string is obtained by slicing the string from the middle to the end and reversing it.
The function returns the concatenation of the left half and the right half of the string.

In this case, the input string is 'n'.
The length of the string is 1, so the left half is 'n' and the right half is ''.
The function returns 'n'.
<<<Output>>>
'n'
