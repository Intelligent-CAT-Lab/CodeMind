The function f takes two arguments: nums and target.
nums is a list of integers, and target is an integer.
The function first counts the number of times target appears in nums using the count() method.
The result is stored in the variable cnt.
The function then returns the value of cnt multiplied by 2.

Since nums is [1, 1], and target is 1, the count() method will return 2.
The function will then return 2 * 2 = 4.
<<<Output>>>
