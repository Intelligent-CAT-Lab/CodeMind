<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and char.
The code checks if char is in text. If it is, it partitions text into three parts: suff, char, and pref, where char is the character that separates them.
The code then modifies the pref part by replacing the first character with the last character of suff, and the last character of suff with the first character of pref.
The code then returns the concatenation of suff, char, and pref.

In this case, the input text is 'uzlwaqiaj' and the input char is 'u'. The code partitions the text into 'uzl', 'u', and 'qiaj'. It modifies the pref part by replacing the first character of 'qiaj' with the last character of 'uzl', which is 'l', and the last character of 'uzl' with the first character of 'qiaj', which is 'q'.
The code then returns the concatenation of 'uzl', 'u', and 'qiaj', which is 'uzlwqiaj'.
<<<Output>>>
uzlwqiaj
