<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: text and num.
The variable text is initialized to 'a', which is a string with length 1.
The variable num is initialized to 19, which is an integer.
The function first calculates the difference between num and the length of text, which is 19 - 1 = 18.
It then centers the text in a string of length num, using the character '*' as the fill character.
The resulting string is '*a******'.
The function then slices the string from the beginning to the middle, using the expression text[:req // 2: -req // 2].
The variable req is 18, so the expression evaluates to text[:9: -9], which is '*a******'[:9: -9] = '*a'.
The function returns this sliced string, which is '*a'.
<<<Output>>>
'*a'
