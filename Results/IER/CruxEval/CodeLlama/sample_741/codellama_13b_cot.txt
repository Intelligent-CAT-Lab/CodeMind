<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: nums, a list of integers, and p, an integer.
The function returns the value of the element at index p-1 in the list nums.
If p-1 is less than 0, the function returns the value of the last element in the list nums.

In this case, the function is called with the arguments [6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7] and 6.
The value of p is 6, so the function returns the value of the element at index 5 in the list, which is 5.

<<<Output>>>
5
