<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input.
It creates a new dictionary r with two keys, 'c' and 'd', and assigns the value of d.copy() to both keys.
The function then returns a tuple containing two values:
1. The result of the expression r['c'] is r['d']
2. The result of the expression r['c'] == r['d']

The expression r['c'] is r['d'] is True because r['c'] and r['d'] both point to the same dictionary object, which is the copy of d.
The expression r['c'] == r['d'] is also True because the two dictionaries have the same keys and values.

Therefore, the return value of the function f({'i': 1, 'love': 'parakeets'}) is (True, True).
<<<Output>>>
(True, True)
