<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array with the same elements but in reverse order.
The function first makes a copy of the input array using the copy() method.
The function then reverses the order of the elements in the copy using the reverse() method.
The function then multiplies each element in the reversed array by 2 using a list comprehension.
The function finally returns the reversed and multiplied array.
<<<Output>>>
[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
