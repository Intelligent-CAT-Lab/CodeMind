<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and returns a new string with only alphanumeric characters.
The code first initializes an empty list a.
It then iterates over each character c in the input string line.
For each character, it checks if it is alphanumeric using the isalnum() method. If it is, it appends it to the list a.
Finally, it joins the list a into a single string using the join() method and returns it.

The input string "\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'" contains a mix of alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric characters.
The code will only keep the alphanumeric characters, which are "normal", "chars", "qwet", "42".
The return value of the function will be the string "normalcharsqwet42".
<<<Output>>>
normalcharsqwet42
