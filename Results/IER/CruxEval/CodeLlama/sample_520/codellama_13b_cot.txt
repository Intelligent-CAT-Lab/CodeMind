<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of integers as input, which is [6] in this case.
The function enters a while loop that checks if the length of the list is not equal to 1. Since the length of the list is 1, the condition is not met, and the loop exits.
The function returns the first element of the list, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
