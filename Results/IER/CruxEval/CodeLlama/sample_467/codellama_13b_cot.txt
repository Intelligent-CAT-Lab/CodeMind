<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary as input, nums.
The first line of the function creates a copy of the input dictionary, copy.
The second line creates an empty dictionary, newDict.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the keys of the copy dictionary, k.
For each key k, the function calculates the length of the corresponding value in the copy dictionary, len(copy[k]), and stores it in newDict with the key k.
The function then returns newDict.

Since the input dictionary is empty, the loop will not execute and newDict will be an empty dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
