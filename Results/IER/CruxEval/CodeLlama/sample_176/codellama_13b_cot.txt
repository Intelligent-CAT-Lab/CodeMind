<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and to_place.
The function first finds the index of the first occurrence of to_place in text, starting from the beginning of the string.
It then uses slicing to extract the substring before the occurrence of to_place, and stores it in before_place.
It then uses slicing to extract the substring after the occurrence of to_place, and stores it in after_place.
Finally, it returns the concatenation of after_place and before_place.

In this case, the input text is 'some text' and the input to_place is 'some'.
The function finds the first occurrence of 'some' in 'some text', which is at index 0.
It then extracts the substring before 'some' as an empty string, and the substring after 'some' as ' text'.
Finally, it returns the concatenation of these two substrings, which is ' text'.
<<<Output>>>
' text'
