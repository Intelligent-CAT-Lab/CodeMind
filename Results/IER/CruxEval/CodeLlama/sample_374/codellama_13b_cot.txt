The function f takes two arguments: a sequence of strings (seq) and a string (v).
The function creates an empty list (a) and iterates over the sequence of strings.
For each string i in the sequence, it checks if i ends with the string v. If it does, it appends the doubled value of i to the list a.
The function returns the list a.

In this case, the sequence of strings is [ 'oH', 'ee', 'mb', 'deft', 'n', 'zz', 'f', 'abA' ] and the string v is 'zz'.
The function will iterate over the sequence and check each string.
The string 'oH' does not end with 'zz', so it will not be appended to the list a.
The string 'ee' does not end with 'zz', so it will not be appended to the list a.
The string 'mb' does not end with 'zz', so it will not be appended to the list a.
The string 'deft' does not end with 'zz', so it will not be appended to the list a.
The string 'n' does not end with 'zz', so it will not be appended to the list a.
The string 'zz' ends with 'zz', so it will be appended to the list a.
The string 'f' does not end with 'zz', so it will not be appended to the list a.
The string 'abA' does not end with 'zz', so it will not be appended to the list a.

After the loop finishes, the function returns the list a, which contains the string 'zz' doubled, which is ['zzzz'].
<<<Output>>>
['zzzz']
