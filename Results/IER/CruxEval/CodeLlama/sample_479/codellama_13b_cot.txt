<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: nums, pop1, and pop2.
nums is a list of integers, and pop1 and pop2 are integers representing the indices of the elements to be removed from the list.
The function first removes the element at index pop1 - 1 from the list, which is 2 - 1 = 1.
Then it removes the element at index pop2 - 1 from the list, which is 4 - 1 = 3.
The function then returns the modified list, which is [1, 5, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 6]
