<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: text, lower, and upper.
The text argument is a string, and the lower and upper arguments are characters.
The function creates a new list called new_text and initializes a counter called count to 0.
The function then iterates over the characters in the text string and performs the following actions:

* If the character is a digit, it replaces it with the lower character.
* If the character is not a digit, it replaces it with the upper character.
* If the character is either 'p' or 'C', it increments the count by 1.
* The function then appends the character to the new_text list.

After the loop finishes, the function returns a tuple containing the count and the joined string of the new_text list.
