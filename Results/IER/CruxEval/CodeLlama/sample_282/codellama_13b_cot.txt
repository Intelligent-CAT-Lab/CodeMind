<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings, s1 and s2, as input.
The function first initializes two variables, position and count, to 1 and 0, respectively.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates as long as position is greater than 0.
The loop first finds the position of the first occurrence of s2 in s1 starting from position.
If the position is not found, the loop exits.
If the position is found, the loop increments count by 1 and then increments position by 1.
The loop then repeats the process until the position is not found.
The function then returns the final value of count, which is the number of times s2 appears in s1.
