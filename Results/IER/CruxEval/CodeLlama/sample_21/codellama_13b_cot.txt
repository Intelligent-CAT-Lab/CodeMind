<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input.
The first line of the function pops the last element of the array and assigns it to the variable n.
The second line extends the array with two copies of the value of n.
The function then returns the modified array.

In this case, the input array is [1, 1, 2, 2].
The function pops the last element, which is 2, and assigns it to n.
The function then extends the array with two copies of n, which is 2.
The final array is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]
