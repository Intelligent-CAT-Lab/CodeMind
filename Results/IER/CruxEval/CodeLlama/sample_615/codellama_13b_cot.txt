The function f takes two arguments: in_list, a list of numbers, and num, a number.
The function appends num to in_list and then returns the index of the maximum element in in_list, excluding the last element.

In this case, the input is [−1, 12, −6, −2] and −1.
The function appends −1 to the list, resulting in [−1, 12, −6, −2, −1].
The maximum element in the list is 12, and its index is 1.
The function returns 1.
