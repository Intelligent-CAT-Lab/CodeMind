<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string argument doc.
The function iterates through each character in the string using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if the character is a letter using the isalpha() method.
If the character is a letter, it returns the capitalized version of the character using the capitalize() method.
If the character is not a letter, it returns a hyphen.

Since the input string 'raruwa' contains only letters, the function will return the capitalized version of the first letter, which is 'R'.
<<<Output>>>
R
