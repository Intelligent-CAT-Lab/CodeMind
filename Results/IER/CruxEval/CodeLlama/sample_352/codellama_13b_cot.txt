The function f takes a list of numbers as input.
The function returns the middle element of the list.
The middle element is calculated by dividing the length of the list by 2 and rounding down to the nearest integer.
In this case, the length of the list is 5, so the middle element is 2.
The function returns the element at index 2, which is -3.
<<<Output>>>
-3
