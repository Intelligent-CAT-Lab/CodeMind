<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and n.
The function checks if n is less than 0 or if the length of text is less than or equal to n. If either of these conditions is true, it returns text.
If the function reaches this point, it means that n is greater than or equal to 0 and the length of text is greater than n.
The function then initializes a variable result to the first n characters of text.
The function then initializes a variable i to the length of result minus 1.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from i to 0 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the function checks if the character at position i in result is the same as the character at position i in text. If it is not, the function breaks out of the loop.
If the loop completes without breaking, the function returns the first i + 1 characters of text.
