<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes three arguments: text, sep, and num.
The text argument is a string, sep is a character, and num is an integer.
The function splits the text string into a list of substrings using the sep character as the delimiter.
The rsplit method is used to split the string from the right side, meaning it will split the string from the end of the string.
The num argument specifies the maximum number of splits to perform.
The join method is then used to join the list of substrings back into a single string, using the '___' string as the separator.

Based on the analysis, the return value of the function would be 'aa___bb'.
<<<Output>>>
'aa___bb'
