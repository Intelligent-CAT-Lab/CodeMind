<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string argument n and converts it to a string using the str() function.
The function then returns the first character of the string (n[0]) followed by a dot ('.') and the rest of the string with all occurrences of '-' replaced by '_' (n[1:].replace('-', '_')).
<<<Output>>>
f("first-second-third") = "f.irst_second_third"
