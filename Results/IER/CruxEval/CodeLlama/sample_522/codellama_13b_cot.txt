<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input.
The first line of the function creates a new list called floats by applying the modulo operator (%) to each number in the input list.
The second line of the function checks if the list floats contains the number 1. If it does, the function returns the list floats. If it doesn't, the function returns an empty list.
The function f is called with the argument range(100, 120), which is a list of numbers from 100 to 119 inclusive.
The function f processes the input by applying the modulo operator to each number in the input list, resulting in a list of numbers from 0 to 19 inclusive.
The function f then checks if the list contains the number 1. Since the list does not contain 1, the function returns an empty list.
