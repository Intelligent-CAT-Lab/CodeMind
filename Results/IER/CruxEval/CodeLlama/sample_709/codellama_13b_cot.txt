The function takes a string argument 'text' and splits it into a list of words using the split() method.
The list is then sorted in descending order using the sort() method with the reverse parameter set to True.
Finally, the list is joined back into a string using the join() method with a space as the separator.
<<<Output>>>
'loved a'
