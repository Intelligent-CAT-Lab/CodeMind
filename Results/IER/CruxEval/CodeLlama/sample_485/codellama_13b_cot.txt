<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string argument called tokens.
The first line of the function splits the string into a list of words using the split() method.
The second line checks if the length of the list is 2. If it is, it reverses the list using the reversed() function.
The third line joins the list of words back into a string using the join() method.
The fourth line pads the first word with spaces to a length of 5 using the ljust() method.
The fifth line pads the second word with spaces to a length of 5 using the ljust() method.
The sixth line returns the final string.

Based on the analysis, the return value of `f('gsd avdropj')` would be `'gsd avdropj'`.

<<<Output>>>
'gsd avdropj'
