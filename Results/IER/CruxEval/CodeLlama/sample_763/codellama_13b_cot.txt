<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: values, text, and markers.
The function returns the text argument with the values and markers removed.
The values argument is '2Pn', which is a string.
The text argument is 'yCxpg2C2Pny2', which is also a string.
The markers argument is '', which is an empty string.
The function first removes the values argument from the text argument using the rstrip method.
The rstrip method removes the specified values from the end of the string.
In this case, the values argument is '2Pn', so the method removes the '2Pn' from the end of the text argument.
The resulting string is 'yCxpg2C2Pn'.
The function then removes the markers argument from the resulting string using the rstrip method.
The markers argument is an empty string, so the method removes nothing from the string.
The resulting string is 'yCxpg2C2Pn'.
<<<Output>>>
'yCxpg2C2Pn'
