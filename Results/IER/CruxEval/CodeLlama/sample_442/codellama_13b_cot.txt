<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list as input and returns a new list with only the even numbers from the input list.
The function first initializes an empty list res to store the even numbers.
The function then iterates through the input list using a for loop, and for each element i in the list, it checks if i is even by using the modulo operator (%). If i is even, it appends i to the res list.
The function then returns a copy of the input list using the lst.copy() method.

Since the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4], the function will only append 2 and 4 to the res list, and then return a copy of the input list, which is [1, 2, 3, 4].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4]
