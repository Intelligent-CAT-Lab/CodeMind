<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input.
The variable middle is initialized to the length of the list divided by 2.
The function returns a new list that is a combination of the elements from the middle index to the end of the list and the elements from the beginning of the list to the middle index.
In this case, the list is [1, 1, 1], so the middle index is 1.
The function returns [1, 1] + [1, 1] = [1, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1]
