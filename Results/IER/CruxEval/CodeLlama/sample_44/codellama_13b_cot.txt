<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and returns a string.
The function first converts the input string to a list of characters using the list() function.
The function then iterates over the list of characters and checks if each character is not equal to '+'. If it is not, it inserts '+' and '*' at the current index and breaks out of the loop.
The function then joins the list of characters back into a string using the '+'.join() method and returns the resulting string.
<<<Output>>>
'+*n+*z+*o+*h'
