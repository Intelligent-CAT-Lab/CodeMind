<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of numbers nums and an index i.
The function first removes the element at index i from the list nums using the pop() method.
The function then returns the modified list nums.

In this case, the function is called with the arguments [35, 45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47] and 0.
The function removes the element at index 0, which is 35, from the list.
The modified list is then returned, which is [45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47].
<<<Output>>>
[45, 3, 61, 39, 27, 47]
