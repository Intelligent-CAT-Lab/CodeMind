The variable phrase is initialized to "aboba 212 has 0 digits".
The code then splits the phrase into a list of words using the split() method.
The list of words is ["aboba", "212", "has", "0", "digits"].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each word in the list.
For each word w, it splits the word into a list of characters using the split() method.
The list of characters is ["a", "b", "o", "b", "a"].
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over each character in the list.
For each character ch in the list, it checks if ch is equal to "0".
The condition is met when ch is "0".
The code then increments the variable ans by 1.
The loop continues until all characters in the list have been checked.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ans, which is 1.
