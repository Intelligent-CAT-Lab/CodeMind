<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of lists (ls) and an integer (n).
The function iterates through the list of lists (ls) and checks if the first element of each sublist is equal to the integer (n).
If the condition is met, the function returns the sublist.
In this case, the function will return the sublist [1, 9, 4] because 1 is the first element of the sublist and n is equal to 1.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 9, 4]
