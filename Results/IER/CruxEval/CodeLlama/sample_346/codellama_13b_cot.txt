<<<Analysis>>>
The variable filename is initialized to 'docs.doc'.
The code splits the filename into two parts using the '.' character as a delimiter. The first part is 'docs' and the second part is 'doc'.
The code then reverses the second part of the filename, which is 'doc', and appends it to the first part, resulting in 'docsdoc'.
The code then checks if the resulting string ends with the original suffix, which is 'doc'. Since it does, the code returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
