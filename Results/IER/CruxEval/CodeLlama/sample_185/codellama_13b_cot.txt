The variable L is initialized to [16, 14, 12, 7, 9, 11].
The variable N is initialized to 6, which is the length of L.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N//2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number k in this range, it initializes i to k-1 and j to N-k.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than j.
Inside the while loop, the code swaps the elements at indices i and j in the list L.
After the swap, the code updates i and j by incrementing i and decrementing j.
The while loop continues until i is greater than or equal to j.
After the while loop finishes, the code returns the final value of L, which is [11, 12, 14, 16, 7, 9].
<<<Output>>>
[11, 12, 14, 16, 7, 9]
