<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function f that takes a string argument text.
The function starts by initializing an index variable index to 1.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates as long as index is less than the length of the text string.
For each iteration, the code checks if the character at the current index position is the same as the character at the previous index position.
If they are not the same, the code increments the index by 1 and continues the loop.
If they are the same, the code splits the text string into two parts using the current index position as the boundary.
The first part is stored in text1, and the second part is stored in text2.
The code then returns the concatenation of text1 and text2, with the second part having its case swapped.
The while loop ends when the index reaches the end of the text string.
If the loop ends without returning a value, the code returns the entire text string with its case swapped.
