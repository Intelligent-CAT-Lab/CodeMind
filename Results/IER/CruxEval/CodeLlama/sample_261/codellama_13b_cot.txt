<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: nums and target.
nums is a list of integers, and target is an integer.
The function first initializes two empty lists: lows and higgs.
It then iterates through the elements of nums using a for loop.
For each element i in nums, it checks if i is less than target.
If it is, it appends i to lows.
If it is not, it appends i to higgs.
After the loop finishes, it clears the lows list and returns the lows and higgs lists.

The return value of f([12, 516, 5, 2, 3, 214, 51], 5) would be ([2, 3, 5], [12, 516, 214, 51]).
<<<Output>>>
([2, 3, 5], [12, 516, 214, 51])
