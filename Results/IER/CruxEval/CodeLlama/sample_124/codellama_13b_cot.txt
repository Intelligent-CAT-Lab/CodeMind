<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes three arguments: txt, sep, and sep_count.
The function first initializes an empty string o.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates while sep_count is greater than 0 and the number of occurrences of sep in txt is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, the function splits txt into two parts using rsplit, with the separator being sep and the maximum number of splits being 1.
The function then adds the first part of the split to o, followed by the separator.
The function then updates txt to be the second part of the split.
The function then decrements sep_count by 1.
The function then returns o concatenated with txt.

The input to the function is 'i like you', ' ', and -1.
The function splits the input into two parts: 'i like' and 'you'.
The function then adds 'i like' to o, followed by the separator ' '.
The function then updates txt to be 'you'.
The function then decrements sep_count by 1.
The function then returns o concatenated with txt, which is 'i like you'.

<<<Output>>>
'i like you'
