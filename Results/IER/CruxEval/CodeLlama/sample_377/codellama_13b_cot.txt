The function takes a string argument called text.
The function splits the text into a list of lines using the splitlines() method.
The function then joins the list of lines into a single string using the join() method.
The join() method takes a separator argument, which is a string that separates the elements of the list. In this case, the separator is a comma and a space.
The function returns the resulting string.
