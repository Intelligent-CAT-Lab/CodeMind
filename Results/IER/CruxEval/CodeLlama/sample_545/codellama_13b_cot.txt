<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array with the elements of the input array in reverse order.
The function first initializes an empty list result and an index variable index to 0.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates as long as index is less than the length of the input array.
For each iteration, the function appends the last element of the input array to the result list and then increments index by 2.
The function then returns the result list.

After the loop finishes, the function returns the result list, which is [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8] in reverse order.
<<<Output>>>
[8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8]
