<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: text, fill, and size.
The function first checks if size is less than 0, and if it is, it sets size to -size.
The function then checks if the length of text is greater than size, and if it is, it returns the last size characters of text.
If the length of text is less than or equal to size, the function returns text with fill characters added to the left to make it size characters long.
<<<Output>>>
'no asw'
