<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input.
The first line of the function creates a copy of the dictionary d using the copy() method.
The second line pops the last item from the dictionary using the popitem() method.
The function then returns the modified dictionary.

Since the dictionary {"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3} has three items, the last item will be popped.
The modified dictionary will have two items {"l": 1, "t": 2}.
<<<Output>>>
{"l": 1, "t": 2}
