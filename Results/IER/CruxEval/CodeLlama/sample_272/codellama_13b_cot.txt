<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: base_list and nums.
base_list is a list of integers, and nums is a list of integers.
The function first extends base_list with nums using the extend method.
The function then creates a copy of base_list and assigns it to res.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from -len(nums) to 0.
For each iteration, the loop appends the element at index i in res to the end of res.
The loop finishes when i is 0.
The function then returns res.

The return value of the function will be a list of integers that is the concatenation of base_list and nums.
<<<Output>>>
[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]
