<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: an array, an integer x, and an integer i.
The function first checks if i is within the range of the array. If i is less than -len(array) or greater than len(array) - 1, it returns the string 'no'.
If i is within the range of the array, the function assigns the value of the element at index i to a variable temp, and then assigns the value x to the element at index i in the array.
Finally, the function returns the array.

In this case, the function is called with the arguments [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], 11, and 4.
The function first checks if 4 is within the range of the array, which it is.
It then assigns the value of the element at index 4 (which is 5) to a variable temp, and then assigns the value 11 to the element at index 4 in the array.
Finally, the function returns the array, which is now [1,2,3,11,5,6,7,8,9,10].
<<<Output>>>
[1,2,3,11,5,6,7,8,9,10]
