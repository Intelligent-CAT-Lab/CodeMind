The function f takes three arguments: text, substr, and occ.
The function first initializes a variable n to 0.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates until the condition is met.
The condition is met when the function finds the substring substr in the text.
The function uses the rfind method to find the last occurrence of the substring in the text.
If the function finds the substring, it returns the index of the substring.
If the function does not find the substring, it returns -1.
If the function finds the substring and the value of n is equal to the value of occ, it returns the index of the substring.
If the function finds the substring and the value of n is not equal to the value of occ, it increments n by 1 and updates the text variable to be the substring before the found substring.
The function then repeats the process until the condition is met.

The function is called with the arguments 'zjegiymjc', 'j', and 2.
The function finds the substring 'j' in the text 'zjegiymjc' at index 2.
The value of n is 1, which is not equal to the value of occ, which is 2.
The function increments n by 1 and updates the text variable to be the substring before the found substring, which is 'zjegiym'.
The function then repeats the process until the condition is met.
The function finds the substring 'j' in the text 'zjegiym' at index 1.
The value of n is 2, which is equal to the value of occ, which is 2.
The function returns the index of the substring, which is 1.
