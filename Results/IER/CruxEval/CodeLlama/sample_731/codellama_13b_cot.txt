<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and use.
The function returns the text argument with all occurrences of the use argument removed.
In this case, the text argument is 'Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday.' and the use argument is 'a'.
The function will return the text argument with all occurrences of the letter 'a' removed, which is 'Chris requires ride to the airport on Friday.'.
<<<Output>>>
'Chris requires ride to the airport on Friday.'
