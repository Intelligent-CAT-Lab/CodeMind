<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary as input, which is represented by the variable bag.
The function first creates a list of values from the dictionary using the list() function.
The function then creates an empty dictionary called tbl.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 99 (inclusive).
For each number v in this range, the function checks if v is in the list of values. If it is, it adds v to the dictionary tbl with the value of the number of times it appears in the list of values.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the dictionary tbl.
<<<Output>>>
{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}
