The function f takes two arguments: a string s and an integer tab.
The function returns the string s with tab spaces inserted before each character.
The function uses the expandtabs method of the string object to achieve this.
The expandtabs method takes an integer argument that specifies the number of spaces to insert before each character.
In this case, the function is called with the string "Join us in Hungary" and the integer 4.
The function returns the string "Join us in Hungary" with 4 spaces inserted before each character.
<<<Output>>>
Join us in Hungary
