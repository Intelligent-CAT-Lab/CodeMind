The variable s is initialized to 'hi '.
The code creates a list a by iterating over the characters in s and filtering out the spaces.
The variable b is initialized to a.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the characters in a in reverse order.
For each character c in a, it checks if c is a space. If it is, it removes the last element from b using the pop() method.
If c is not a space, the loop breaks.
The code returns the string ''.join(b), which is an empty string.
