The function takes a string as input and returns a string.
The code first converts the input string to a list of characters using the list() function.
The code then iterates over the list of characters using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if the index of the character is odd using the modulo operator (%). If it is odd, it swaps the case of the character using the swapcase() method.
Finally, the code joins the list of characters back into a string using the join() method.
