<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: match, fill, and n.
The function returns the first n characters of fill followed by the match argument.
In this case, the function is called with the arguments '9', '8', and 2.
The first n characters of '8' are '8' and '8', so the function returns '889'.
<<<Output>>>
'889'
