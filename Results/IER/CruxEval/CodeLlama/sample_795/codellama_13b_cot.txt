The code takes a string as input and returns a modified version of it.
The function first capitalizes the first letter of the string using the title() method.
The function then replaces all occurrences of the substring 'Io' with 'io' using the replace() method.
The modified string is then returned.

The input string is 'Fu,ux zfujijabji pfu.'.
The first letter is capitalized to 'F'.
The substring 'Io' is replaced with 'io' to get 'Fu,ux zfujijabji pfu.'.
The modified string is returned.

<<<Output>>>
Fu,ux zfujijabji pfu.
