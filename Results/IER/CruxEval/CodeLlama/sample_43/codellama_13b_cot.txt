<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a single argument n, which is a string.
The function iterates over the characters in the string using a for loop.
For each character i in the string, it checks if i is a digit using the isdigit() method.
If any character is not a digit, the function sets n to -1 and breaks out of the loop.
If all characters are digits, the function returns n.

In this case, the input string "6 ** 2" contains non-digit characters (the ** operator).
Therefore, the function sets n to -1 and returns -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
