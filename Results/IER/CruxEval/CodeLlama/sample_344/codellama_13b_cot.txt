<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list and an operation.
The list argument is initialized to [6, 4, 2, 8, 15].
The operation argument is initialized to a lambda function that takes a list as input and reverses it.
The function f creates a new list new_list by copying the input list using slicing.
The function f then sorts the new_list in ascending order.
The function f then applies the operation to the new_list.
The operation is a lambda function that takes a list as input and reverses it.
The function f then returns the original input list.
<<<Output>>>
[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]
