items is a list of strings, and item is a string.
The function first checks if the last element of items is equal to item. If it is, it removes the last element from the list.
It then appends item to the end of the list and returns the length of the list.

The input to the function is a list of strings, and the item is 'n'.
The function will remove the last element of the list if it is 'n', and then append 'n' to the end of the list.
The length of the list will be 19.
