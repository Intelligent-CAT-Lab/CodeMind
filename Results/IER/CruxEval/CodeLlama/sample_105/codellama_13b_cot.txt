<<<Analysis>>>
The code checks if the input text is in title case (i.e., if the first letter of each word is capitalized). If it is not, the code returns the title case version of the text. If it is, the code returns the lowercase version of the text.
In this case, the input text is "PermissioN is GRANTed", which is not in title case. Therefore, the code returns the title case version of the text, which is "Permission is Granted".
<<<Output>>>
"Permission is Granted"
