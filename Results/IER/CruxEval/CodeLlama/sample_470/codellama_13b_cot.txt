The variable number is initialized to 2, which will be used to check if the values in the dictionary transl are divisible by it.
The dictionary transl is initialized with the keys 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E', and the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the key-value pairs in transl.
For each pair, it checks if the value is divisible by number. If it is, it appends the key to the list result.
The condition is met when the value is 2, 4, and 5.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of result, which is ['B', 'D', 'E'].
<<<Output>>>
['B', 'D', 'E']
