<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and returns a byte string.
The code first encodes the input string to UTF-8 and then iterates over each byte in the encoded string.
For each byte, it checks if it is equal to 61 (which is the ASCII code for '='). If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If the byte is not equal to 61, the code checks if it is equal to 0. If it is, it skips the current iteration of the loop using the pass statement.
If the byte is not equal to 0, the code appends the current byte to a list called res.
After the loop finishes, the code joins the list of bytes using the b''.join() method and returns the resulting byte string.
