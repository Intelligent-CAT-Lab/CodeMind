<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary as input, and it returns a new dictionary with the keys and values swapped.
The code first creates a new dictionary called dic2, which is a copy of the input dictionary dic.
The code then uses the zip function to create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a value from dic and its corresponding key.
The code then uses the dict function to create a new dictionary from the list of tuples, which is the final output of the function.
<<<Output>>>
{'a': -1, 'b': 0, 'c': 1}
