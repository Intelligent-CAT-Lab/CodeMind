<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an array and a number.
The function first checks if the number is negative. If it is, it sets the variable reverse to True and multiplies the number by -1.
The function then reverses the array and multiplies it by the absolute value of the number.
The function then checks if the variable reverse is True. If it is, it reverses the array again.
The function then returns the final array.

In this case, the input is [1, 2] and 1.
The function first checks if 1 is negative, which it is not.
It then reverses the array [1, 2] to [2, 1] and multiplies it by 1.
It then checks if reverse is True, which it is not.
It then returns the final array [2, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 1]
