<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two lists as input, arr1 and arr2.
The first line of the function creates a copy of arr1 and assigns it to a new variable new_arr.
The second line extends new_arr with the elements of arr2.
The function then returns the modified new_arr.

In this case, the input to the function is [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] and ['', 0, -1, []].
The function will first create a copy of the first list, which is [5, 1, 3, 7, 8].
It will then extend this copy with the elements of the second list, which are ['', 0, -1, []].
The resulting list will be [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []].
The function will then return this modified list.
<<<Output>>>
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]
