<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, price and product.
The variable inventory is initialized to a list of strings ['olives', 'key', 'orange'].
The code checks if the product is in the inventory. If it is not, the function returns the price.
If the product is in the inventory, the code multiplies the price by 0.85 and removes the product from the inventory.
The function then returns the new price.
Since 'grapes' is not in the inventory, the function returns the original price of 8.50.
<<<Output>>>
8.50
