<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer n as input.
The code checks if the string representation of n contains a decimal point.
If it does, it returns the string representation of the integer part of n plus 2.5.
If it doesn't, it returns the string representation of n.
In this case, the string representation of 800 is '800', which does not contain a decimal point.
Therefore, the function returns '800'.
<<<Output>>>
'800'
