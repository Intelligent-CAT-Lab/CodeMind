<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string argument called multi_string.
The function first splits the string into a list of words using the split() method.
The function then applies the isascii() method to each word in the list to check if it is an ASCII character.
The function then uses the map() function to apply the isascii() method to each word in the list.
The function then checks if any of the words in the list are True.
If any of the words are True, the function returns a string that is a comma-separated list of the words that are ASCII characters.
If all of the words are False, the function returns an empty string.
<<<Output>>>
'I, am, hungry, eat, food'
