<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of years as input.
The code first calculates the number of years that are less than or equal to 1900 (a10) and the number of years that are greater than 1910 (a90).
The code then checks if a10 is greater than 3, if it is, it returns 3.
If a90 is greater than 3, it returns 1.
If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 2.

In this case, the input list is [1872, 1995, 1945].
The code calculates a10 as 1 (since 1872 is the only year that is less than or equal to 1900) and a90 as 2 (since 1995 and 1945 are both greater than 1910).
Since a10 is not greater than 3, the code checks if a90 is greater than 3.
Since a90 is greater than 3, the code returns 1.
