<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: a string and a character.
The function first splits the string into a list of words using the split() method.
The list of words is then iterated over, and each word is iterated over again to append each character to a new list.
The function then checks if the character is in the new list.
If it is, the function returns True.
If it is not, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
