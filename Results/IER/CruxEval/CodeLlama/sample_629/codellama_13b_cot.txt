The function f takes two arguments: text and dng.
The function checks if dng is not in text. If it is, it returns text.
If dng is in text, the function checks if the last len(dng) characters of text are equal to dng. If they are, it returns text without the last len(dng) characters.
If the last len(dng) characters of text are not equal to dng, it returns text without the last character and recursively calls f with the first len(dng)-1 characters of text and dng.

The function is called with the arguments 'catNG' and 'NG'.
The function checks if 'NG' is not in 'catNG'. It is not, so it returns 'catNG'.
The function then checks if the last 2 characters of 'catNG' are equal to 'NG'. They are not, so it returns 'catN'.
The function then recursively calls f with the first 1 characters of 'catN' and 'NG'.
The function checks if 'NG' is not in 'cat'. It is not, so it returns 'cat'.
The function then checks if the last 2 characters of 'cat' are equal to 'NG'. They are not, so it returns 'ca'.
The function then recursively calls f with the first 1 characters of 'ca' and 'NG'.
The function checks if 'NG' is not in 'ca'. It is not, so it returns 'ca'.
The function then checks if the last 2 characters of 'ca' are equal to 'NG'. They are not, so it returns 'c'.
The function then recursively calls f with the first 1 characters of 'c' and 'NG'.
The function checks if 'NG' is not in 'c'. It is not, so it returns 'c'.
The function then checks if the last 2 characters of 'c' are equal to 'NG'. They are not, so it returns ''.
The function then recursively calls f with the first 1 characters of '' and 'NG'.
The function checks if 'NG' is not in ''. It is not, so it returns ''.
