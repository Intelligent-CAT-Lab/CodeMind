<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input.
The first line of the function creates a dictionary d using the fromkeys method of the dict class. The method takes two arguments: a sequence of keys and a value to assign to each key. In this case, the sequence is s, and the value is 0.
The method returns a dictionary with the keys from s and the value 0.
The second line of the function returns the keys of the dictionary d as a list.
<<<Output>>>
['1', '2', 'a', 'b', '2', '3', 'x', 'y']
