<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string argument called names.
The code first splits the string into a list of words using the split() method.
The resulting list is stored in the variable parts.
The code then iterates over the list using the enumerate() function, which returns the index and value of each element in the list.
For each element, the code replaces the substring " and" with "+", capitalizes the first letter of each word, and replaces the substring "+" with " and".
The resulting list is then joined using the join() method, with each element separated by a comma.
The code returns the resulting string.
<<<Output>>>
Carrot, Banana and Strawberry
