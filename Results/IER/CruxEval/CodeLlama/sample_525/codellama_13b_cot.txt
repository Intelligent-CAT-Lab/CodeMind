<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments:
c, st, and ed.
c is a dictionary with keys 'TEXT' and 'CODE' and values 7 and 3, respectively.
st and ed are the values 7 and 3, respectively.
The function first initializes two variables, a and b, to 0.
It then creates a new dictionary, d, and assigns it to the value of c.
The function then iterates through the items in c using a for loop.
For each item, it assigns the key to the value of y and the value to the key of x.
It then checks if y is equal to st or ed.
If y is equal to st, it assigns the value of x to a.
If y is equal to ed, it assigns the value of x to b.
The function then assigns the value of d[st] to w.
Finally, the function returns a tuple containing w and b if a is greater than b, or b and w if a is less than or equal to b.
<<<Output>>>
(3, 7)
