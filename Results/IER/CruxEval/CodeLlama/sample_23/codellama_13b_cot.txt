<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and chars.
The function first checks if the variable chars is not empty. If it is not, it removes the characters in chars from the end of text using the rstrip method. If chars is empty, it removes spaces from the end of text using the rstrip method with the argument ' '.
The function then checks if the resulting text is empty. If it is, it returns a hyphen. Otherwise, it returns the resulting text.

In this case, the input text is 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2' and the input chars is '0123456789-'.
The function first removes the characters in chars from the end of the text, resulting in 'new-medium-performing-application'.
The function then checks if the resulting text is empty, which it is not. Therefore, it returns the resulting text, which is 'new-medium-performing-application'.
<<<Output>>>
new-medium-performing-application
