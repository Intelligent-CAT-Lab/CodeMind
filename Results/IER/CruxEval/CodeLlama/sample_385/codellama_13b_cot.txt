<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list as input and returns a new list with the first three elements that appear more than once in the input list.
The function starts by initializing two variables: i, which is set to 0, and new_list, which is initialized to an empty list.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates over the input list.
For each element in the list, the function checks if the element is in the remaining elements of the list (using the slice notation).
If the element is in the remaining elements, the function appends it to the new_list and checks if the length of the new_list is now 3.
If it is, the function returns the new_list.
If the length of the new_list is not 3, the function continues to the next element in the input list.
If the input list is exhausted, the function returns the new_list.
<<<Output>>>
