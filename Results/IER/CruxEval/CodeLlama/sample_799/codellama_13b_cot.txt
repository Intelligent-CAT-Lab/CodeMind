The code defines a function f that takes a string argument st.
The function checks if the first character of st is '~'. If it is, it calls itself recursively with a modified string e, which is the result of calling the rjust method on st with the arguments (10, 's').
If the first character of st is not '~', the function returns the result of calling the rjust method on st with the arguments (10, 'n').
The code then calls f with the input string 'eqe-;ew22'.

The first call to f will pass the string 'eqe-;ew22' to the function. The function will check if the first character of 'eqe-;ew22' is '~'. Since it is not, the function will return the result of calling the rjust method on 'eqe-;ew22' with the arguments (10, 'n').

The second call to f will pass the string 's' to the function. The function will check if the first character of 's' is '~'. Since it is, the function will call itself recursively with the modified string 's'.

The third call to f will pass the string 'ss' to the function. The function will check if the first character of 'ss' is '~'. Since it is, the function will call itself recursively with the modified string 'ss'.

The fourth call to f will pass the string 'sss' to the function. The function will check if the first character of 'sss' is '~'. Since it is, the function will call itself recursively with the modified string 'sss'.
