<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes three arguments: text, length, and index.
The text argument is a string, length is an integer, and index is an integer.
The function splits the text string into a list of substrings using the rsplit method, with the index argument as the maximum number of splits.
The function then joins the list of substrings with the '_' character, and returns the resulting string.

In this case, the function is called with the arguments 'hypernimovichyp', 2, and 2.
The text string is split into a list of substrings ['hyper', 'nimovichyp'], with the maximum number of splits being 2.
The list of substrings is then joined with the '_' character, resulting in the string 'hyper_nimovichyp'.

<<<Output>>>
hyper_nimovichyp
