<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array with the elements squared.
The function first makes a copy of the input array using the copy() method.
The function then reverses the order of the elements in the new array using the reversed() function.
The function then applies the square operation to each element in the new array using a list comprehension.
The function returns the new array.

The input array is [1, 2, 1].
The function makes a copy of the input array, which is [1, 2, 1].
The function reverses the order of the elements in the new array, which is [1, 2, 1].
The function applies the square operation to each element in the new array, which is [1, 4, 1].
The function returns the new array, which is [1, 4, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 1]
