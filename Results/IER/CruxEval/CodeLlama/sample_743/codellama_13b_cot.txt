<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and splits it into two substrings using the comma as the delimiter.
The first substring is assigned to string_a and the second substring is assigned to string_b.
The function then returns the negative of the sum of the lengths of string_a and string_b.

In this case, the input string is 'dog,cat', so string_a is 'dog' and string_b is 'cat'.
The length of string_a is 3 and the length of string_b is 3.
Therefore, the function returns -6.
<<<Output>>>
-6
