[INST: What would be the return value of `f('ED20 CW')`?]  The return value of `f('ED20 CW')` would be `'CW'`.

Explanation:
The function `f` takes a string argument `postcode` and returns a substring of `postcode` starting from the index of the first occurrence of the letter `'C'` in `postcode`.
In this case, the first occurrence of `'C'` in `'ED20 CW'` is at index 4, so the return value of `f('ED20 CW')` would be `'CW'`.
