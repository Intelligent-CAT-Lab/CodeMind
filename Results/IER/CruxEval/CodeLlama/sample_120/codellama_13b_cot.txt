<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary of countries and their corresponding languages as input.
The function creates an empty dictionary language_country and iterates over the input dictionary countries.
For each country, it checks if the language is already present in the language_country dictionary.
If it is not, it adds the language as a key and an empty list as its value.
It then appends the current country to the list corresponding to the language.
The function returns the final value of language_country, which is a dictionary with languages as keys and lists of countries as values.
