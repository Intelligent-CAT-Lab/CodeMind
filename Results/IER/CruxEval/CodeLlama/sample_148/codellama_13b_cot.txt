The function f takes two arguments: a string forest and a character animal.
The function first finds the index of the character animal in the string forest using the index() method.
The function then creates a new list result by copying the elements of the string forest.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the list result.
For each element in the list, the function checks if the index of the element is less than the length of the list - 1.
If it is, the function replaces the element with the next element in the list and increments the index.
If the index is equal to the length of the list - 1, the function replaces the element with a hyphen.
The function then joins the elements of the list result into a string using the join() method and returns the result.

The input to the function is '2imo 12 tfiqr.' and 'm'.
The function finds the index of 'm' in the string '2imo 12 tfiqr.' to be 2.
The function creates a new list result by copying the elements of the string '2imo 12 tfiqr.'.
The function then enters the loop and replaces the element at index 2 with the next element in the list, which is 'o'.
The function then increments the index to 3 and replaces the element at index 3 with the next element in the list, which is '1'.
The function then increments the index to 4 and replaces the element at index 4 with the next element in the list, which is '2'.
The function then increments the index to 5 and replaces the element at index 5 with the next element in the list, which is 't'.
The function then increments the index to 6 and replaces the element at index 6 with the next element in the list, which is 'f'.
The function then increments the index to 7 and replaces the element at index 7 with the next element in the list, which is 'i'.
The function then increments the index to 8 and replaces the element at index 8 with the next element in the list, which is 'q'.
The function then increments the index to 9 and replaces the element at index 9 with the next element in the list, which is 'r'.
The function then increments the index to 10 and replaces the element at index 10 with a hyphen.
The function then joins the elements of the list result into a string using the join() method and returns the result.

The return value of the function is '2imo - 12 tfiqr.'.
<<<Output>>>
'2imo - 12 tfiqr.'
