<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to '123'.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of text (inclusive), which is 3 in this case.
For each iteration, the code appends the substring of text starting from the current index to the end of the string to text_arr.
The substring of text starting from index 0 is '123', the substring of text starting from index 1 is '23', and the substring of text starting from index 2 is '3'.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of text_arr, which is ['123', '23', '3'].
<<<Output>>>
['123', '23', '3']
