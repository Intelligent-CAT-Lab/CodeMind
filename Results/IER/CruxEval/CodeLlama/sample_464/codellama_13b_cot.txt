<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string argument ans.
The function first checks if the string is a decimal number using the isdecimal() method.
If the string is a decimal number, the function calculates the total by multiplying the string by 4 and subtracting 50.
The function then calculates the number of characters in the string that are not in the set '02468' and subtracts 100 times that number from the total.
Finally, the function returns the total.

In this case, the input string is '0'.
The function checks that the string is a decimal number, and since it is, it calculates the total as 0 * 4 - 50 = -50.
The function then calculates the number of characters in the string that are not in the set '02468' as 1 (since the string contains only the character '0').
It subtracts 100 times this number from the total, which gives -50 - 100 = -150.
Finally, the function returns -150.
<<<Output>>>
-150
