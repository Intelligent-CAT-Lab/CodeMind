<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: string and substring.
The function starts by checking if the string starts with the substring. If it does, it removes the substring from the beginning of the string and updates the string variable.
The function then returns the updated string.
Since the string is initially empty, the function will not enter the while loop and will return the empty string.
