The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array with the same elements as the input array, but with any duplicates removed.
The function first initializes two variables: prev, which is set to the first element of the input array, and newArray, which is a copy of the input array.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the remaining elements of the input array, starting from the second element.
For each element i in the input array, the function checks if it is equal to the previous element (prev). If it is not, the function adds it to the newArray. If it is equal to the previous element, the function deletes it from the newArray.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the newArray.
