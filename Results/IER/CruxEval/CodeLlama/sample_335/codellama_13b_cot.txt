<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to 'sjbrlfqmw', and the variable to_remove is initialized to 'l'.
The code creates a new list new_text by converting the string text to a list of characters.
The code checks if the character 'l' is in the list new_text.
If it is, the code finds the index of the character 'l' in the list and removes it.
The code then inserts a question mark at the same index and removes it.
The code then joins the list of characters back into a string and returns it.
The return value of the code will be 'sjbrfqmw'.
<<<Output>>>
sjbrfqmw
