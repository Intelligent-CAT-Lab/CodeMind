<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and chars.
The function returns text.rstrip(chars) if text is not empty, and text otherwise.
The rstrip method removes any trailing characters from the string that are in the set of characters specified by the argument.
In this case, the argument is an empty string, which means that the function will remove any trailing whitespace characters from the string.
Since the string 'ha' does not have any trailing whitespace characters, the function will return the original string.
<<<Output>>>
'ha'
