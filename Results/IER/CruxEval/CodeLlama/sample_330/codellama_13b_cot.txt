The function f takes a string as input and returns a string.
The function iterates over each character in the input string using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if the character is a digit using the isdigit() method.
If the character is a digit, it appends the character to a list called ans.
If the character is not a digit, it appends a space to the list.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the joined string of the list using the join() method.
<<<Output>>>
'm 4 n 2 o'
