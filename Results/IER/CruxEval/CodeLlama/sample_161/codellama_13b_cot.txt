<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and value.
The function first partitions the text into three parts using the value as the separator.
The left part is the text before the separator, the right part is the text after the separator, and the middle part is the separator itself.
The function then returns the concatenation of the right part and the left part.

In this case, the text is 'difkj rinpx' and the value is 'k'.
The partitioning results in left = 'dif', right = 'j rinpx', and middle = 'k'.
The function returns 'j rinpxdif'.
<<<Output>>>
'j rinpxdif'
