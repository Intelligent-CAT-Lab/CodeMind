<<<Analysis>>>
The variable var is initialized to 1, which is an integer.
The code checks the type of var using the type() function. It is an integer, so the first if statement is not executed.
The code then checks if var is a list using the type() function. It is not a list, so the second if statement is not executed.
The code then checks if var is a dictionary using the type() function. It is not a dictionary, so the third if statement is not executed.
The code then returns the value of amount, which is 0.
