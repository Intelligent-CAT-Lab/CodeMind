<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to "wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl".
The code then splits the text into a list of words using the split() method.
The list is then iterated over using a for loop.
For each word i in the list, the code checks if the length of i is greater than the current value of m.
If it is, the value of m is updated to the length of i, and the variable cnt is incremented by 1.
The code then returns the final value of cnt, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
