The function f takes an array as input.
The code first checks if -1 is in the array, and if it is, it removes the last element of the array using the pop() method.
The code then checks if 0 is in the array, and if it is, it removes the last element of the array using the pop() method.
The code then checks if 1 is in the array, and if it is, it removes the first element of the array using the pop(0) method.
The code then returns the modified array.

In this case, the input array is [0, 2], and the code will remove the last element (2) and the first element (0) from the array.
The modified array will be [].
