The variable bots is initialized to the list ['yR?TAJhIW?n', 'o11BgEFDfoe', 'KnHdn2vdEd', 'wvwruuqfhXbGis'].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in the list bots.
For each element, it checks if the element is not in uppercase using the isupper() method.
If the element is not in uppercase, it appends the first two characters and the last three characters of the element to the list clean.
The code then returns the length of the list clean.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the length of the list clean, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
