The function f takes two arguments: text and prefix.
The code starts by initializing idx to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates over the letters in prefix.
For each letter in prefix, it checks if the corresponding letter in text is the same.
If they are not the same, the function returns None.
If they are the same, the code increments idx by 1.
The loop finishes when all letters in prefix have been checked.
If the loop finishes without returning None, the code returns the substring of text starting from the index idx.
