<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, s1 and s2.
The function checks if s2 ends with s1. If it does, it returns s2 with the last occurrence of s1 removed.
In this case, s2 ends with s1, so the function returns s2 with the last occurrence of "he" removed, which is "hel".
<<<Output>>>
"hel"
