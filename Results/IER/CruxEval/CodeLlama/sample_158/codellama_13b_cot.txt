<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array arr as input.
The code first creates a new array n by filtering the elements of arr that are even numbers.
The code then concatenates n with arr to create a new array m.
The code then iterates over m and removes any elements that are not in n.
The code returns the final value of m.

In this case, the input array is [3, 6, 4, -2, 5].
The code will first create a new array n with the even numbers from the input array, which is [6, 4].
The code will then concatenate n with the input array to create a new array m, which is [6, 4, 3, 6, 4, -2, 5].
The code will then iterate over m and remove any elements that are not in n, which are the odd numbers 3 and -2.
The code will then return the final value of m, which is [6, 4, 6, 4, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[6, 4, 6, 4, 5]
