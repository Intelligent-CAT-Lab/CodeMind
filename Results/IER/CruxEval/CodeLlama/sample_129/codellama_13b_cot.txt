<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and search_string.
The function first initializes an empty list called indexes.
The function then enters a loop that iterates while search_string is found in text.
For each iteration, the function appends the index of the last occurrence of search_string in text to indexes.
The function then updates text by removing the last occurrence of search_string.
The loop continues until search_string is no longer found in text.
The function then returns the final value of indexes.

In this case, the input text is 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ' and the search_string is 'J'.
The function will iterate 3 times, appending the indexes 10, 20, and 29 to indexes.
The function will then return the final value of indexes, which is [10, 20, 29].
<<<Output>>>
[10, 20, 29]
