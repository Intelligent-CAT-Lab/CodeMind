<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list xs as input.
The code enters a loop that iterates from -len(xs)-1 to -1, which is equivalent to iterating from -3 to -1.
For each iteration, the code inserts the first element of xs at the current index (which is negative) and then pops the first element of xs.
The loop finishes when the index is -1, which means the first element of xs has been inserted at the last position of xs.
The code then returns xs.
<<<Output>>>
[3, 1, 2]
