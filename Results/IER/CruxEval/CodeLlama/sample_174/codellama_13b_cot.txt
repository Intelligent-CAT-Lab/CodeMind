<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list as input and modifies it in place.
The first line of the function, lst[1:4] = lst[1:4][::-1], is a slice assignment. It assigns the reversed slice of the list to the same slice.
The slice [1:4] selects the elements at indices 1, 2, and 3. The [::-1] reverses the order of the elements in the slice.
Therefore, the function reverses the elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 in the input list.
The function then returns the modified list.
<<<Output>>>
[3, 2, 1]
