<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and char.
The variable position is initialized to the length of text, which is 10.
The code checks if char is in text. Since 'w' is in 'wduhzxlfk', the condition is met.
The code then calculates the position of 'w' in text, which is 0.
The code then checks if position is greater than 1. Since it is not, the code does not execute the next line.
The function returns position, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
