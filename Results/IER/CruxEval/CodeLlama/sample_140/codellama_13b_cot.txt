The code takes a string argument st.
The code first converts the string to lowercase using the lower() method.
The code then finds the index of the last occurrence of the letter 'i' in the lowercase string using the rindex() method.
The code then finds the index of the last occurrence of the letter 'h' in the lowercase string, starting from the index of the last occurrence of 'i' using the rindex() method.
The code then checks if the index of the last occurrence of 'h' is greater than or equal to the index of the last occurrence of 'i'.
If it is, the code returns the string 'Hey'.
If it is not, the code returns the string 'Hi'.
<<<Output>>>
'Hi'
