<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and returns a substring of the input string.
The function first initializes a variable i to -1.
The function then enters a loop that iterates while the string sample contains the character '/' after the current index i.
The loop increments i to the index of the next '/' character in the string.
The function then returns the substring of the input string from the beginning to the index i-1.

The input string 'present/here/car%2Fwe' contains 3 '/' characters.
The loop iterates 3 times, with i taking on the values 0, 7, and 14.
The function returns the substring 'present/here/car%2F' for each iteration.
The final return value is 'present/here/car%2F'.
<<<Output>>>
'present/here/car%2F'
