<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: container and cron.
The function first checks if cron is in container. If it is not, it returns container.
If cron is in container, the function creates two copies of container: pref and suff.
pref is the part of container before cron, and suff is the part of container after cron.
The function then returns the concatenation of pref and suff.

In this case, the input is [ ] and 2. Since 2 is not in the empty list, the function returns [].
<<<Output>>>
[]
