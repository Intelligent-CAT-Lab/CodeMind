The function f takes three arguments: nums, pos, and value.
nums is a list of numbers, pos is the position where the value should be inserted, and value is the value to be inserted.
The function first inserts the value at the specified position in the list.
Then, it returns the modified list.

In this case, the function is called with the arguments [3, 1, 2], 2, and 0.
The list [3, 1, 2] is inserted at position 2 with the value 0, resulting in the list [3, 1, 0, 2].
The function returns the modified list [3, 1, 0, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[3, 1, 0, 2]
