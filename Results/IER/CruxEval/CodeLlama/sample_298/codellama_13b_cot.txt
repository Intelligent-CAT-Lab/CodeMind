<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to 'dst vavf n dmv dfvm gamcu dgcvb.'.
The code creates a new list new_text by iterating over the characters of text.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of new_text.
For each character in new_text, it swaps the case of the character and stores it in new_character.
The code then replaces the original character in new_text with the new_character.
The code then joins the characters in new_text into a string and returns it.

The return value of the code will be 'DST VAVF N DMV DFVM GAMCU DGCVB.'.
<<<Output>>>
DST VAVF N DMV DFVM GAMCU DGCVB.
