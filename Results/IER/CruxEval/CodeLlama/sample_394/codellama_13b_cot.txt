The variable text is initialized to "2 m2 \n\nbike".
The code then splits the text into lines using the splitlines() method, which returns a list of strings.
The variable k is initialized to this list.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list k.
For each string j in k, it checks if the length of j is 0. If it is, it returns i, which is 0 in this case.
If the length of j is not 0, it increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns -1.
<<<Output>>>
0
