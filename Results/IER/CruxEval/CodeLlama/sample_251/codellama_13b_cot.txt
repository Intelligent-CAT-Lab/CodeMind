<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of lists as input, where each sublist represents a message.
The function first initializes a variable phone_code to "+353".
It then initializes an empty list result.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over each sublist in the input list.
For each sublist, it appends phone_code to the sublist using the extend method.
It then joins the elements of the sublist using the ";" separator and appends the resulting string to result using the append method.
Finally, it joins the elements of result using the ". " separator and returns the resulting string.

<<<Output>>>
Marie;Nelson;Oscar;+353.
