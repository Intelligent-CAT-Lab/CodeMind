<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the length of the input list.
For each iteration, the code inserts the square of the current number at the current index.
The loop finishes when all the numbers in the list have been processed.
The code then returns the modified list.

The input list is [1, 2, 4].
The output list will be [1, 4, 16, 256].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 16, 256]
