<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: array, ind, and elem.
The array argument is a list of integers, and the ind argument is an integer that represents the index at which the elem argument should be inserted.
The elem argument is the value that should be inserted into the array.
The function first checks if the ind argument is less than 0, and if it is, it inserts the elem argument at index -5.
If the ind argument is greater than the length of the array, it inserts the elem argument at the end of the array.
Otherwise, it inserts the elem argument at the index ind + 1.
After the insertion, the function returns the modified array.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 7, 8, 2, 0, 3]
