The function f takes a string as input and returns a new string with all alphanumeric characters converted to uppercase.
The code iterates over each character in the input string using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if the character is alphanumeric using the isalnum() method. If it is, it appends the uppercase version of the character to the result string using the += operator.
The code then returns the result string.

In this case, the input string is 'с bishop.Swift'.
The code iterates over each character in the input string and checks if it is alphanumeric.
The first character 'с' is not alphanumeric, so it is not appended to the result string.
The second character 'b' is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the result string as 'B'.
The third character 'i' is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the result string as 'I'.
The fourth character 's' is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the result string as 'S'.
The fifth character 'h' is not alphanumeric, so it is not appended to the result string.
The sixth character 'i' is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the result string as 'I'.
The seventh character 'p' is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the result string as 'P'.
The eighth character 'b' is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the result string as 'B'.
The ninth character 'o' is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the result string as 'O'.
The tenth character 's' is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the result string as 'S'.
The eleventh character 'w' is not alphanumeric, so it is not appended to the result string.
The twelfth character 'i' is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the result string as 'I'.
The thirteenth character 'f' is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the result string as 'F'.
The fourteenth character 't' is not alphanumeric, so it is not appended to the result string.

The final result string is 'BISHIPBOSWIFT'.
