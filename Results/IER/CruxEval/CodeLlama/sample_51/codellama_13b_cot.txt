<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to a string of less than symbols (<) repeated 10 times.
The function f takes an integer argument num and returns either s or num - 1 based on whether num is even or odd.
The code enters the if statement and checks if num is even. Since 21 is odd, the else clause is executed and the function returns num - 1, which is 20.
<<<Output>>>
20
