The function f takes two arguments: stg and tabs.
stg is a string, and tabs is a tuple of strings.
The function iterates over the elements of tabs and removes each element from the end of stg using the rstrip method.
The rstrip method removes any of the characters in the argument from the end of the string.
The function returns the modified string stg.

The input to the function is:
stg = '31849 let it!31849 pass!'
tabs = ('3','1','8',' ','1','9','2','d')

The function iterates over the elements of tabs and removes each element from the end of stg.
The first element of tabs is '3', so the function removes the last occurrence of '3' from the end of stg.
The second element of tabs is '1', so the function removes the last occurrence of '1' from the end of stg.
The third element of tabs is '8', so the function removes the last occurrence of '8' from the end of stg.
The fourth element of tabs is ' ', so the function removes the last occurrence of ' ' from the end of stg.
The fifth element of tabs is '1', so the function removes the last occurrence of '1' from the end of stg.
The sixth element of tabs is '9', so the function removes the last occurrence of '9' from the end of stg.
The seventh element of tabs is '2', so the function removes the last occurrence of '2' from the end of stg.
The eighth element of tabs is 'd', so the function removes the last occurrence of 'd' from the end of stg.

After all the elements of tabs have been removed from the end of stg, the function returns the modified string stg.

The return value of the function is:
'let it!31849 pass!'
<<<Output>>>
'let it!31849 pass!'
