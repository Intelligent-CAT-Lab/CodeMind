<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: names and winners.
The variable names is a list of strings ['e', 'f', 'j', 'x', 'r', 'k'], and the variable winners is a list of strings ['a', 'v', '2', 'im', 'nb', 'vj', 'z'].
The code first creates a list comprehension that iterates over the names list and checks if each name is in the winners list. If it is, it adds the index of that name to the list ls.
The code then sorts the list ls in descending order using the sort() method with the reverse parameter set to True.
Finally, the code returns the sorted list ls.
<<<Output>>>
[4, 5, 2, 0, 1, 3]
