The variable selfie is initialized to [4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6].
The length of selfie is calculated and stored in lo.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from lo-1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the last 7 elements of the list.
For each element i in this range, it checks if i is equal to the first element of the list (selfie[0]). If it is, it removes the last element of the list (selfie[lo-1]) from the list.
The loop finishes when i reaches 0, and the code returns the final value of selfie, which is [4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 2]
