The variable x is initialized to 0.0, which is a positive number.
The code then checks if x is greater than 0 using the > operator.
Since x is equal to 0, the condition is not met, and the code enters the else block.
In the else block, the code returns the negative of x using the unary minus operator.
The code returns 0.0.

[INST: What is the output of the following code?] 
<Code>
def f(x):
    if x > 0:
        return x
    else:
        return -x
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f(-0.0)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
