<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and splits it into a list of words using the split() method.
The list of words is then converted into a dictionary using the dict() function, where each word is a key and its index in the list is the value.
The string '${first}y, ${second}x, ${third}r, ${fourth}p' is then formatted using the % operator, where each placeholder is replaced by the corresponding value from the dictionary.
The function returns the formatted string.
<<<Output>>>
'pythony, rubyx, cyr, javascriptp'
