<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and returns a string.
The code first creates a list of characters from the input string using a list comprehension.
The list comprehension iterates over each character in the input string and creates a new list with each character.
The code then iterates over each character in the list and uses the swapcase() method to change the case of each character.
The swapcase() method changes the case of each character to the opposite case. For example, if the character is lowercase, it changes it to uppercase, and if it is uppercase, it changes it to lowercase.
The code then joins the list of characters back into a string using the join() method.
The join() method joins the list of characters into a string by concatenating them together.
