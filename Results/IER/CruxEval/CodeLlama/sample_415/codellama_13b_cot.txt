<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input.
The first line of the function creates a dictionary from the array using the dict() function.
The second line iterates over the dictionary using the items() method.
The third line checks if the value of each key is between 0 and 9.
If the value is not between 0 and 9, the function returns None.
If the value is between 0 and 9, the function returns the dictionary.

The input to the function is ((8, 5), (8, 2), (5, 3)).
The dictionary created from the input is {(8, 5): 5, (8, 2): 2, (5, 3): 3}.
The function returns the dictionary as the output.

<<<Output>>>
{(8, 5): 5, (8, 2): 2, (5, 3): 3}
