<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input.
The code enters a loop that iterates from the second-to-last index of the list to 0, inclusive.
For each index i, the code checks if the number at that index is even.
If it is, the code removes the number at that index from the list.
The loop stops when i becomes -1, which is the first index of the list.
The code then returns the modified list.

Based on the analysis, the return value of `f([5, 3, 3, 7])` should be `[5, 3, 7]`.
<<<Output>>>
[5, 3, 7]
