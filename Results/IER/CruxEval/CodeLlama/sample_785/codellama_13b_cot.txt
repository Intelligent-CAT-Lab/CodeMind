<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 1, which is a single digit number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string representation of n, which is "1".
For each character c in this range, it appends c to streak, which is initially an empty string.
The code then multiplies the length of c by 2 and uses the ljust() method to pad the string with spaces to the left, so that the length of the string is twice the length of c.
The code then adds the padded string to streak.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of streak, which is "1".
<<<Output>>>
"1"
