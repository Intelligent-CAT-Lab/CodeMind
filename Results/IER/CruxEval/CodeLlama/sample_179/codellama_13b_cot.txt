<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes in a list of numbers, nums, and returns a modified version of that list.
The first line of the function creates a copy of the input list to avoid modifying the original list.
The second line calculates the length of the list, which is used in the loop.
The loop iterates from -count+1 to 0, which means it will iterate from -6 to 0.
For each iteration, the loop inserts the element at index i into the beginning of the list.
The loop stops when i is 0, which means the first element of the list is inserted into the beginning of the list.
The function then returns the modified list.
<<<Output>>>
[7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2, 7]
