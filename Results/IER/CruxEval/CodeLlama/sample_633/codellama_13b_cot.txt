<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an array and an element.
The array is reversed using the reverse() method.
The index() method is then used to find the index of the element in the array.
The array is then reversed again using the reverse() method.
The index of the element is returned if it is found in the array, otherwise None is returned.

In this case, the array is [5, -3, 3, 2] and the element is 2.
The array is reversed to [2, 3, -3, 5].
The index() method is used to find the index of 2 in the array, which is 0.
The array is then reversed again to [5, -3, 3, 2].
The index of 2 in the array is 0, so the function returns 0.
