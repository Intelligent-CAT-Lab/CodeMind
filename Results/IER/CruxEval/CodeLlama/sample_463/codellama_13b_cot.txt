<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary with the same keys and values.
The function first creates a copy of the input dictionary using the copy() method.
The function then iterates over the items in the dictionary using the items() method.
For each item, it checks if the value is also a key in the dictionary. If it is, it removes the key from the new dictionary using the del keyword.
The function then returns the new dictionary.

In this case, the input dictionary is {-1: -1, 5: 5, 3: 6, -4: -4}.
The function first creates a copy of the input dictionary, which is {5: 5, 3: 6, -4: -4}.
It then iterates over the items in the dictionary and checks if the value is also a key in the dictionary.
For the item with key -1 and value -1, the value is not a key in the dictionary, so it is not removed.
For the item with key 5 and value 5, the value is a key in the dictionary, so it is removed.
For the item with key 3 and value 6, the value is not a key in the dictionary, so it is not removed.
For the item with key -4 and value -4, the value is a key in the dictionary, so it is removed.
The function then returns the new dictionary, which is {5: 5, 3: 6, -4: -4}.
<<<Output>>>
{5: 5, 3: 6, -4: -4}
