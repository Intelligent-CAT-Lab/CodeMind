<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and char.
The function creates a new variable new_text, which is initialized to the value of text.
The function creates an empty list a.
The function enters a loop that iterates while char is in new_text.
For each iteration, the function appends the index of char in new_text to a.
The function then replaces the first occurrence of char in new_text with an empty string.
The function returns a.

The input to the function is 'rvr' and 'r'.
The function creates a new variable new_text, which is initialized to 'rvr'.
The function creates an empty list a.
The function enters the loop and appends 0 to a.
The function replaces the first occurrence of 'r' in new_text with an empty string, resulting in 'vr'.
The function enters the loop again and appends 1 to a.
The function replaces the first occurrence of 'r' in new_text with an empty string, resulting in 'vr'.
The function exits the loop since 'r' is no longer in new_text.
The function returns a, which is [0, 1].
<<<Output>>>
