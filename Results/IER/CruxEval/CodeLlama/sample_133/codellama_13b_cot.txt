<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: nums and elements.
nums is a list of integers, and elements is a list of integers.
The function creates an empty list called result and iterates through the elements list using a for loop.
For each element in the elements list, the function appends the last element of the nums list to the result list.
The function then returns the nums list.

The input to the function is [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 2] and [9, 0, 3].
The elements list has three elements: 9, 0, and 3.
The nums list has six elements: 7, 1, 2, 6, 0, and 2.
The function appends the last element of the nums list (2) to the result list three times, resulting in [2, 2, 2].
The function then returns the nums list, which is [7, 1, 2, 6, 0].

<<<Output>>>
[2, 2, 2]
