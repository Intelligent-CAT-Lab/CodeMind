<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: instagram, imgur, and wins.
The first two arguments are lists of strings.
The third argument is an integer.
The function first creates a list called photos that contains the values of instagram and imgur.
The function then checks if instagram and imgur are equal. If they are, it returns the value of wins.
If wins is equal to 1, it returns the last element of the list photos.
Otherwise, it reverses the list photos and returns the last element.
