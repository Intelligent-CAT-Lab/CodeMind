<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings, s1 and s2, as input.
The function first initializes an empty list, res, to store the indices of s2 in s1.
The function then uses the rfind method to find the first occurrence of s2 in s1, starting from the end of s1.
The function then appends the index of the last character of s2 to res.
The function then uses the rfind method again to find the next occurrence of s2 in s1, starting from the end of s1 and excluding the last character of s2.
The function repeats this process until the rfind method returns -1, indicating that s2 is not found in s1.
The function then returns the list res.

Based on the analysis, the return value of f('abcdefghabc', 'abc') would be [9, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[9, 6]
