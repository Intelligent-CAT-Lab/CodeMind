<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and returns its length.
The code first initializes two variables, a and b, to empty strings.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the input string.
For each character i in the input string, the code checks if it is a space character using the isspace() method.
If it is not a space character, the code appends the current value of b to the list a and sets b to an empty string.
If it is a space character, the code appends the current character to b.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the length of the list a, which is 1 in this case.
