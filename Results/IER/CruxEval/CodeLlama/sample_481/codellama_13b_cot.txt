<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes in three arguments: values, item1, and item2.
The values argument is a list of integers, and item1 and item2 are integers.
The function checks if the last element of the values list is equal to item2.
If it is, the function checks if the first element of the values list is not in the list of values from the second element to the last element.
If the first element is not in the list, the function appends the first element to the end of the list.
If the last element is equal to item1, the function checks if the first element is equal to item2.
If the first element is equal to item2, the function appends the first element to the end of the list.
The function then returns the values list.

In this case, the values list is [1, 1], item1 is 2, and item2 is 3.
The last element of the values list is 1, which is not equal to item2.
The first element of the values list is 1, which is not in the list of values from the second element to the last element.
The function appends the first element to the end of the list, resulting in [1, 1, 1].
The function then returns the values list, which is [1, 1, 1].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1]
