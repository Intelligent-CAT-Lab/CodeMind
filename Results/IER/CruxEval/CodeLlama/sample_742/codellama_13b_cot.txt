<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to "-1-3".
The code enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string.
For each character x in the string, it checks if x is a digit using the isdigit() method.
If x is a digit, the code sets b to True.
If x is not a digit, the code sets b to False and breaks out of the loop using the break statement.
Since the first character in the string is a hyphen, the code sets b to False and breaks out of the loop.
The code then returns the final value of b, which is False.
<<<Output>>>
False
