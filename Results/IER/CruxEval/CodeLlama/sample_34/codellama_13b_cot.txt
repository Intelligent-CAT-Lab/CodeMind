<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: nums, odd1, and odd2.
The function first checks if odd1 is in nums and removes it if it is.
It then checks if odd2 is in nums and removes it if it is.
Finally, it returns the modified list nums.

In this case, the function is called with the arguments [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3], 3, and 1.
The function first checks if 3 is in the list and removes it if it is.
It then checks if 1 is in the list and removes it if it is.
The modified list is then returned.

The return value of the function is [2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 3, 5, 21, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 3, 5, 21, 3]
