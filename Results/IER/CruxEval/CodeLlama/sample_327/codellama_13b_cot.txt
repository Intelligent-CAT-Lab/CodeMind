<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list as input and returns a new list.
The code first initializes a new list new and sets the index i to the length of the input list minus 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the input list.
For each iteration, the code checks if the index i is even or odd.
If it is even, the code appends the negative of the element at index i to the new list.
If it is odd, the code appends the element at index i to the new list.
The code then decrements i by 1 and repeats the process until the loop finishes.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the new list.

Based on the analysis, the return value of f([1, 7, -1, -3]) would be [-7, 1, -1, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[-7, 1, -1, 3]
