<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function f that takes a string as input.
The function first initializes a variable bigTab to 100.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 10 to 30 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if the string contains between 0 and 20 tabs.
If the condition is met, bigTab is set to i and the loop is exited using the break statement.
The code then returns the string with the tabs expanded to the value of bigTab.

The input string '1  \t\t\t3' contains 3 tabs.
The loop iterates from 10 to 30, and the condition is met when i is 10.
bigTab is set to 10, and the loop is exited.
The code returns the string with the tabs expanded to 10 spaces.
<<<Output>>>
'1         3'
