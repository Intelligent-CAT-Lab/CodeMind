<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and symbols.
The function first checks if symbols is not empty. If it is not, it enters a loop that iterates over the symbols and increments count by 1 for each symbol.
The function then multiplies text by count and returns the result.
Since symbols is not empty, the loop will iterate over the symbols and increment count by 1 for each symbol.
The function then multiplies text by count and returns the result.
The function then returns the result of text.rjust(len(text) + count*2)[:-2].
