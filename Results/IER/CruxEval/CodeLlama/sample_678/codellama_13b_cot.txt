<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string argument text and returns a dictionary called freq.
The code first converts the input text to lowercase using the lower() method.
The code then iterates through each character in the text using a for loop.
For each character c, it checks if c is already a key in the freq dictionary.
If it is, it increments the corresponding value by 1.
If it is not, it adds c as a key in the freq dictionary with a value of 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the freq dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{'h': 1, 'i': 1}
