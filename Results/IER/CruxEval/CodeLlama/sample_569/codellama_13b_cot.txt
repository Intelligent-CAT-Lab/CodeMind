The variable txt is initialized to "11 1 1".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in txt.
For each character c in txt, it checks if c is already in the dictionary coincidences.
If it is, it increments the value of c in coincidences by 1.
If it is not, it adds c to coincidences with a value of 1.
The loop finishes and the code returns the sum of all values in coincidences.
