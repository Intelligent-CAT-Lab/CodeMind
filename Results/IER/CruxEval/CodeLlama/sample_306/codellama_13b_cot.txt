<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input.
The function first initializes an empty list called digits.
The function then iterates through the list of numbers and checks if each number is either an integer or a string that represents a number. If it is, it appends the number to the digits list.
The function then converts the list of strings to a list of integers using the map function.
The function finally returns the list of integers.

In this case, the input list is [0, 6, '1', '2', 0].
The function will iterate through the list and check each element.
The first element, 0, is an integer and is appended to the digits list.
The second element, 6, is an integer and is appended to the digits list.
The third element, '1', is a string that represents a number and is appended to the digits list.
The fourth element, '2', is a string that represents a number and is appended to the digits list.
The fifth element, 0, is an integer and is appended to the digits list.
The function then converts the list of strings to a list of integers using the map function.
The function finally returns the list of integers, which is [0, 6, 1, 2, 0].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 6, 1, 2, 0]
