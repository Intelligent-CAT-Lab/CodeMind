<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns a new string with all occurrences of 'a' and 'r' removed.
The code first replaces all occurrences of 'a' with an empty string using the replace method.
Then it replaces all occurrences of 'r' with an empty string using the replace method again.
The final return value is the modified string with all occurrences of 'a' and 'r' removed.
<<<Output>>>
'pp'
