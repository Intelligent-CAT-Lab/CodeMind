<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers as input.
The function creates an empty dictionary dic and iterates through the list of integers lists.
For each integer n in the list, the function checks if n is already in the dictionary.
If it is, the function appends the current value of n to the list associated with n in the dictionary.
If it is not, the function creates a new list with the current value of n and adds it to the dictionary with the key n.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the string representation of the dictionary, with all spaces removed.

The input list [5, 2, 7, 2, 3, 5] will result in the following dictionary:
{5: [5, 5], 2: [2, 2], 7: [7], 3: [3]}
The function will return the string representation of this dictionary, which is:
{'5': ['5', '5'], '2': ['2', '2'], '7': ['7'], '3': ['3']}

<<<Output>>>
{'5': ['5', '5'], '2': ['2', '2'], '7': ['7'], '3': ['3']}
