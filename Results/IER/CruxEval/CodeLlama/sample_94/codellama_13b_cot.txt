<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two dictionaries as input, a and b.
The return value of the function is a new dictionary that contains the key-value pairs from both a and b.
If there are duplicate keys, the value from b will be used.
In this case, the input dictionaries are {'w': 5, 'wi': 10} and {'w': 3}.
The function will return {'w': 3, 'wi': 10}.
<<<Output>>>
{'w': 3, 'wi': 10}
