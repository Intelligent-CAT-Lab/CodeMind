<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of vectors as input.
The code first initializes an empty list sorted_vecs to store the sorted vectors.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the input list of vectors.
For each vector vec in the input list, the code sorts the vector using the sort() method and appends the sorted vector to the sorted_vecs list.
The code then returns the sorted_vecs list.

Since the input list of vectors is empty, the loop does not execute and the function returns an empty list.
