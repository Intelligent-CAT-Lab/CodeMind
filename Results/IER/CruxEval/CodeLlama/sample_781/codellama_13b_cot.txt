<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, s and ch.
The code checks if ch is in s. If it is not, it returns an empty string.
If ch is in s, the code partitions s around the first occurrence of ch and returns the second part of the partitioned string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the partitioned string.
For each iteration, the code partitions the string around the first occurrence of ch and returns the second part of the partitioned string.
The loop continues until the length of the partitioned string is 0.
The final value of the partitioned string is returned.

Based on the analysis, the return value of `f('shivajimonto6', '6')` would be '6'.
<<<Output>>>
