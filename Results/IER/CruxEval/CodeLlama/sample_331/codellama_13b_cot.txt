<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: strand and zmnc.
The first line of the function finds the first occurrence of zmnc in strand and stores its position in poz.
The while loop starts by checking if poz is not equal to -1, which means that the substring zmnc was found in strand.
If it is, the loop continues by slicing strand from the position of the first occurrence of zmnc to the end of the string, and then finding the first occurrence of zmnc in the resulting string.
This process continues until the substring is not found in the string, at which point the loop exits.
The final line of the function returns the position of the last occurrence of zmnc in strand.

Since the input string is empty, the function will not find any occurrences of the substring zmnc, and the loop will not execute.
Therefore, the return value of the function will be -1, which indicates that the substring was not found in the string.
<<<Output>>>
-1
