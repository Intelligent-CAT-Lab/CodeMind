The variable text is initialized to "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string.
For each character s in the string, it checks if s is a whitespace character using the isspace() method.
If s is a whitespace character, it adds 1 to the variable ws.
After the loop finishes, the code returns a tuple containing the value of ws and the length of the string.
