<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input, and it modifies the list by doubling each number in the list.
The function first clears the list, which means it removes all the elements from the list.
Then it iterates over the list and appends each number to the end of the list, multiplied by 2.
Finally, it returns the modified list.

After the function call, the list [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2] is modified to [8, 6, 4, 2, 4, -2, 8, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[8, 6, 4, 2, 4, -2, 8, 4]
