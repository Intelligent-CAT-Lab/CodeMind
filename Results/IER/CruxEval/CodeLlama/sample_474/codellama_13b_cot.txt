<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: txt and marker.
txt is a string that contains the text to be processed.
marker is an integer that specifies the width of the output.
The function first splits the txt string into a list of lines using the '\n' character as a delimiter.
It then iterates over each line in the list and appends the line to a new list a, after centering it using the marker value as the width.
Finally, the function joins the elements of the list a using the '\n' character and returns the resulting string.
<<<Output>>>
'     #[)[]>[^e>\n 8\n'
