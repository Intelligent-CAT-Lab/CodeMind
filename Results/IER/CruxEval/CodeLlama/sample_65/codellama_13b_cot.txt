<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a list of numbers nums and an index.
The function returns the result of the following expression:
nums[index] % 42 + nums.pop(index) * 2

The expression is evaluated as follows:

1. nums[index] % 42: This returns the remainder of dividing the value at index 3 (which is 3) by 42. The result is 3.
2. nums.pop(index) * 2: This removes the element at index 3 from the list and multiplies it by 2. The result is 6.
3. The final result is 3 + 6 = 9.

Therefore, the return value of f([3, 2, 0, 3, 7], 3) is 9.
<<<Output>>>
