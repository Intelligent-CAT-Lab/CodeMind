The function f takes two arguments, s and sep.
The variable s is initialized to "not it", and the variable sep is initialized to "".
The code then finds the index of the first occurrence of sep in s using the find() method.
Since sep is an empty string, the index returned is -1, indicating that sep is not found in s.
The code then initializes the variable prefix to the substring of s before the first occurrence of sep, which is the entire string "not it".
The variable middle is initialized to the substring of s between the first occurrence of sep and the second occurrence of sep, which is an empty string.
The variable right_str is initialized to the substring of s after the second occurrence of sep, which is also an empty string.
The code then returns the tuple (prefix, middle, right_str), which is ("not it", "", "").
<<<Output>>>
("not it", "", "")
