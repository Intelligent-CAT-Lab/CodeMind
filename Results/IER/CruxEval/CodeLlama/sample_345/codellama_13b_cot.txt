<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a and b.
The function checks if a is less than b, and if it is, it returns a tuple containing b and a in that order.
If a is not less than b, the function returns a tuple containing a and b in that order.
In this case, 'ml' is less than 'mv', so the function returns ('mv', 'ml').
<<<Output>>>
('mv', 'ml')
