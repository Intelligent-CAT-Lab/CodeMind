The function f takes a matrix as input.
The matrix is reversed using the reverse() method.
The function then iterates over the rows of the matrix using a for loop.
For each row, the function finds the maximum value using the max() function.
The row is then sorted in descending order using the sort() method with the reverse parameter set to True.
The sorted row is then appended to the result list.
The function returns the result list.

The input to the function is a list of lists, where each sublist has four elements.
The function reverses the order of the sublists, and then iterates over each sublist.
For each sublist, the function finds the maximum value, which is the last element of the sublist.
The sublist is then sorted in descending order, which means the maximum value is moved to the first position.
The sorted sublist is then appended to the result list.
The function returns the result list, which is a list of sorted sublists.

<<<Output>>>
[[4, 3, 2, 1]]
