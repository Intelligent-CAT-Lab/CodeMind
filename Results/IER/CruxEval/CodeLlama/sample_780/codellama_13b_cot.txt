<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers as input.
The function creates a list of 301 elements, each initialized to 0, and assigns it to the variable counts.
The function then iterates over the input list ints and increments the corresponding element in the counts list for each integer in ints.
The function then iterates over the counts list and appends the index of each element that has a value of at least 3 to a list called r.
Finally, the function returns a string containing the elements of r separated by spaces.

Based on the analysis, the return value of f([2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89]) would be "2 3 5 89".
<<<Output>>>
2 3 5 89
