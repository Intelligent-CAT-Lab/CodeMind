<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: text and chars.
The text argument is a string, and the chars argument is a string of characters.
The function first converts the chars argument to a list using the list() function.
It then converts the text argument to a list using the list() function.
The function then creates a new list called new_text and initializes it to the value of text.
The function then enters a loop that iterates while the length of new_text is greater than 0 and text is not empty.
Inside the loop, the function checks if the first element of new_text is in the chars list.
If it is, the function removes the first element of new_text using the pop() method.
If it is not, the function breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the joined string of new_text using the join() method.
