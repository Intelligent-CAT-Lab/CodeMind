<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to 'was,'.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the length of text minus 1 to 0, meaning it will consider the characters in the string in reverse order.
For each character i in this range, it adds the character to the variable result.
The loop finishes and the code returns the final value of result, which is ',was'.
<<<Output>>>
',was'
