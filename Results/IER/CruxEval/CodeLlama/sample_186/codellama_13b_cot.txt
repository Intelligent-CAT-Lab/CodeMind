<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string argument 'text' and returns a string.
The function first splits the input string into a list of words using the split() method.
The map() function is then applied to the list of words, with the lstrip() method applied to each word.
The lstrip() method removes any leading whitespace from each word.
Finally, the join() method is used to join the list of words back into a single string, with a space character (' ') used as the separator.
<<<Output>>>
'pvtso'
