<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and splits it into a list of words using the split() method.
The list is then joined back into a string using the " ".join() method, but only every third word is included.
The resulting string is then split into lines using the splitlines() method.
The function then creates an empty list called res.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 1 (exclusive) and appends the result of the join() method to the res list.
The join() method is called with a list of words from the original list, but only every third word is included.
The loop stops when the length of the list of words is less than 3 times the current iteration index plus 1.
Finally, the function returns the list of lines and the list of words.
<<<Output>>>
['echo', 'hello!!!', 'nice!']
