<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers as input, nums.
The code enters a loop that iterates from the last index of the list to 0, inclusive.
For each index i, the code checks if the element at that index is odd.
If it is, the code inserts a copy of that element at the next index, i+1.
The loop then continues until the first index is reached.
The function then returns the modified list.

After the loop finishes, the list [2, 3, 4, 6, -2] will be modified to [2, 3, 4, 6, -2, 3, 4, 6, -2].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 3, 4, 6, -2, 3, 4, 6, -2]
