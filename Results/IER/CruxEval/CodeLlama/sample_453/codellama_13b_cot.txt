<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string and a character.
The function returns True if the string ends with the character, and False otherwise.
In this case, the string is 'wrsch)xjmb8' and the character is 'c'.
The function checks if the last character of the string is 'c'.
Since the last character of the string is '8', the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
