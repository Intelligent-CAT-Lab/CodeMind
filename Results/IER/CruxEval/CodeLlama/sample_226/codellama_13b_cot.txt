<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input.
The code iterates through the list using a for loop, and for each number nums[i], it checks if nums[i] is divisible by 3.
If it is, the code appends nums[i] to the end of the list.
The code then returns the modified list.

In this case, the input list is [1, 3], and the code appends 3 to the end of the list, making it [1, 3, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 3]
