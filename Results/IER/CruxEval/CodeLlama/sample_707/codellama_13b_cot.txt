The function f takes two arguments: text and position.
The length of the text is calculated using the len() function.
The index is calculated using the position argument and the length of the text.
If the position is less than 0 or the index is less than 0, the index is set to -1.
The text is converted to a list using the list() function.
The element at the index is removed from the list using the pop() method.
The list is converted back to a string using the join() method.
The return value of the function is the modified string.
