<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and returns a string.
The code first splits the input string into a list of lines using the '\n' character as a delimiter.
The list is stored in variable a.
The code then iterates over the list and replaces all occurrences of '\t' with '    ' (4 spaces) using the replace() method.
The modified lines are stored in variable b.
Finally, the code joins the lines in variable b using the '\n' character and returns the resulting string.
