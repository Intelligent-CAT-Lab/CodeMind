<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an array and an element.
The element is converted to a string using the str() function.
The function then iterates over the array using a for loop.
For each element in the array, it checks if the element is equal to the element passed as an argument.
If it is, it increments a counter variable d.
The function then returns the value of d.

In this case, the array is [-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2] and the element is 2.
The function will iterate over the array and find two elements that are equal to 2, which are 2 and -8.
The counter variable d will be incremented twice, and the function will return 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
