<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string argument txt and returns a new string.
The function first initializes an empty list d.
It then iterates over each character c in the string txt.
For each character c, it checks if it is a digit using the isdigit() method. If it is a digit, it skips to the next character using the continue statement.
If the character is not a digit, it checks if it is a lowercase letter using the islower() method. If it is a lowercase letter, it appends the uppercase version of the character to the list d using the append() method.
If the character is not a lowercase letter, it checks if it is an uppercase letter using the isupper() method. If it is an uppercase letter, it appends the lowercase version of the character to the list d using the append() method.
Finally, the function returns the joined string of the list d using the join() method.
<<<Output>>>
