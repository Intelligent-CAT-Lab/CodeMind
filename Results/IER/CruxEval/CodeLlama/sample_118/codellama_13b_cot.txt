<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and chars.
The variable num_applies is initialized to 2, which means the loop will run twice.
The variable extra_chars is initialized to an empty string.
The loop iterates twice, with each iteration adding the value of chars to extra_chars.
The text argument is replaced with the result of the replace method, which removes any occurrences of extra_chars from the text.
The loop finishes, and the function returns the final value of text.
