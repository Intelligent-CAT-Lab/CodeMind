<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: val and text.
The function first creates a list of indices where the character val appears in the string text.
The list is created using a list comprehension that iterates over the range of indices in the string text and checks if the character at each index is equal to val.
If the list of indices is empty, the function returns -1.
Otherwise, it returns the first index in the list.

In this case, the function is called with val = 'o' and text = 'fnmart'.
The list of indices where 'o' appears in 'fnmart' is [1, 3, 5].
Since the list is not empty, the function returns the first index in the list, which is 1.
