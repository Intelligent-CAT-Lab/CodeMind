<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, text and sub.
The function first initializes two variables, a and b, to 0 and len(text) - 1, respectively.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates as long as a is less than or equal to b.
The loop calculates the midpoint of the range using the formula (a + b) // 2 and stores it in variable c.
The function then checks if the substring sub is found in the text starting from the midpoint c.
If it is found, the function sets a to c + 1.
If it is not found, the function sets b to c - 1.
The loop continues until a is greater than b, at which point the function returns a.

Based on the analysis, the return value of f('dorfunctions', '2') would be 2.
