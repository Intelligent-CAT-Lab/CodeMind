<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list as input, and returns a new list with the same elements in reverse order.
The function first calculates the length of the input list using the len() function, and stores it in the variable item_count.
The function then creates an empty list called new_list.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to item_count-1, meaning it will consider each element in the input list.
For each element, it appends the element to the new_list using the append() method.
The function then returns the new_list.
<<<Output>>>
[8, 6, 8, 5, 4]
