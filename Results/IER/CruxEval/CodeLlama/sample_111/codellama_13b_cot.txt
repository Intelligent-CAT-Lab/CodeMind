<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary as input, where each key is a string and each value is an integer.
The function first initializes two variables, highest and lowest, to 0 and 100, respectively.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the values in the dictionary.
For each value, it checks if it is greater than the current highest value and updates the highest value accordingly.
It also checks if it is less than the current lowest value and updates the lowest value accordingly.
After the loop finishes, the function returns a tuple containing the highest and lowest values.
<<<Output>>>
