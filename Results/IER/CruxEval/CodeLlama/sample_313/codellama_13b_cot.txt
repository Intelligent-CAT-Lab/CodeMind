The function f takes two arguments, s and l.
s is a string, and l is an integer.
The function returns a string.
The code first calls the ljust method on the string s, passing in the integer l and the character '=' as arguments.
The ljust method returns a new string that is the original string s, with the character '=' appended to the end of the string until the length of the string is equal to the integer l.
The code then calls the rpartition method on the string returned by ljust, passing in the character '=' as an argument.
The rpartition method returns a tuple of three strings, where the first string is the part of the string before the first occurrence of the character '=', the second string is the part of the string between the first and second occurrences of the character '=', and the third string is the part of the string after the second occurrence of the character '='.
The code then returns the first string in the tuple, which is the part of the string before the first occurrence of the character '='.
