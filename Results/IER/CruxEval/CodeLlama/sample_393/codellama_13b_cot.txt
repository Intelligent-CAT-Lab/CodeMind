The variable text is initialized to 'scala'.
The code then creates a new variable ls, which is a reversed version of text.
The code then creates a new variable text2, which is initialized to an empty string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from len(ls) - 3 to 0, stepping backwards by 3.
For each iteration, the code joins the current 3 characters of ls with '---' and appends the result to text2.
The code then returns text2, but with the last 3 characters removed.

Since the length of 'scala' is 5, the loop will iterate 5/3 = 1 times.
The first iteration will join the characters 'a', 'l', and 'c' with '---' to form '---a---l---c---'.
The resulting string is then appended to text2, which is now '---a---l---c---'.
The code then returns text2, which is '---a---l---c---'.
<<<Output>>>
'---a---l---c---'
