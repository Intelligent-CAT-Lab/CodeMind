<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and returns a new string.
The code first initializes an empty list new_text.
It then iterates over each character in the input string text.
For each character, it checks if it is uppercase using the isupper() method.
If it is uppercase, it inserts the character at the middle of the list new_text.
The middle index is calculated using the len(new_text) // 2 expression.
If the list new_text is empty after the loop, it is assigned the value ['-'].
Finally, the code joins the characters in new_text into a single string and returns it.
<<<Output>>>
'S-m-a-b-p-a-r-t-o-f-R-e-x-E-x-l-i-b-r-a-r-y'
