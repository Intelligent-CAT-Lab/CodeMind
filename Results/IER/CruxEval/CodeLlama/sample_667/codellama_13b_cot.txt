The variable text is initialized to 'C7', which is a string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of text (in this case, 3) divided by 3.
For each iteration, the code appends a string to the new_text list, which is a list of strings.
The string is constructed by concatenating the string "< ", the substring of text from the current iteration index multiplied by 3 to the current iteration index multiplied by 3 plus 3, the string " level=", and the current iteration index.
The loop finishes when the iteration index is equal to the length of text divided by 3.
The code then appends another string to the new_text list, which is constructed by concatenating the string "< ", the substring of text from the length of text divided by 3 multiplied by 3 to the end of the text, the string " level=", and the length of text divided by 3.
Finally, the code returns the new_text list.
<<<Output>>>
['< C level=0 >', '< 7 level=1 >']
