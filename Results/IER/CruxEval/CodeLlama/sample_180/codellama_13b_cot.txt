<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers as input, nums.
The function first initializes two variables, a and b, to -1 and nums[1:], respectively.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates while a is less than or equal to the first element of b.
Inside the loop, the function removes the first element of b from nums and sets a to 0.
The function then updates b to be the remaining elements of b, starting from the second element.
The loop continues until a is greater than the first element of b.
After the loop finishes, the function returns nums.

Based on the analysis, the return value of f([-1, 5, 3, -2, -6, 8, 8]) would be [5, 3, 8, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 3, 8, 8]
