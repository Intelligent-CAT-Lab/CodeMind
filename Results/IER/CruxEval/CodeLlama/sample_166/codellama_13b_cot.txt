<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary as input, graph.
The function creates a new dictionary, new_graph, and initializes it to an empty dictionary.
The function then iterates over the key-value pairs in graph using a for loop.
For each key-value pair, the function creates a new key-value pair in new_graph with the same key and an empty string as the value.
The function then iterates over the subkeys in the value of the key-value pair in graph and adds an empty string as the value for each subkey in new_graph.
The function returns new_graph.

Since the input to the function is an empty dictionary, the function creates an empty dictionary and returns it.
