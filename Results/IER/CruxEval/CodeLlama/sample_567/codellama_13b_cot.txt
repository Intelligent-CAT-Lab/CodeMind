<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments, s and n.
s is a string, and n is an integer.
The function splits the string s into a list of words using the rsplit() method.
The function then creates an empty list called out.
The function enters a loop that iterates while the length of the list ls is greater than or equal to n.
In each iteration, the function adds the last n elements of the list ls to the list out.
The function then removes the last n elements of the list ls.
The function repeats this process until the length of the list ls is less than n.
The function then returns the list ls with the last element joined to the list out using the '_'.join() method.

The return value of the function will be a list of strings.

<<<Output>>>
['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'one_two_three_four_five']
