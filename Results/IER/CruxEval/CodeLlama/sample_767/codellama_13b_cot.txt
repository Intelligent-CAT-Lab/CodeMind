<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string argument text.
The code first strips the leading and trailing whitespace from the text using the strip() method.
The code then splits the text into a list of words using the split() method with a space as the delimiter.
The code then iterates over the list of words using a for loop.
For each word in the list, the code checks if the word is a digit using the isdigit() method.
If the word is not a digit, the code returns the string '-'.
If the word is a digit, the code does not return anything.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the list of words joined together with a space as the delimiter using the join() method.
