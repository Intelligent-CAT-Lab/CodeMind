<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers as input, nums.
The code checks if the list is a palindrome by comparing the original list with its reverse.
The list [0, 3, 6, 2] is not a palindrome, as its reverse is [2, 6, 3, 0], which is different from the original list.
Therefore, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
