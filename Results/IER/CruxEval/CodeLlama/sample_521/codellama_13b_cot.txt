<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers as input, nums.
The first line of the function calculates the maximum value in the list, m, and stores it in a variable.
The second line of the function creates a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1.
For each iteration, the loop reverses the order of the elements in the list nums.
The loop repeats until i reaches m-1.
The function then returns the modified list nums.

The input list [43, 0, 4, 77, 5, 2, 0, 9, 77] is passed to the function f.
The maximum value in the list is 77, so the loop iterates from 0 to 76.
For each iteration, the loop reverses the order of the elements in the list, resulting in the list being reversed.
The final value of the list is [9, 0, 2, 5, 77, 4, 0, 43].

<<<Output>>>
[9, 0, 2, 5, 77, 4, 0, 43]
