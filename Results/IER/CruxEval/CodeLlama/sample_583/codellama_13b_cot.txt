<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and ch.
The text argument is a string with multiple lines, and the ch argument is a character.
The function splits the text into lines using the splitlines() method, and then iterates over each line.
For each line, it checks if the line is not empty and if the first character of the line is equal to the ch character.
If both conditions are true, it appends the lowercase version of the line to the result list.
If either condition is false, it appends the uppercase version of the line to the result list.
After the loop finishes, the function joins the lines of the result list using the "\n" separator and returns the resulting string.
