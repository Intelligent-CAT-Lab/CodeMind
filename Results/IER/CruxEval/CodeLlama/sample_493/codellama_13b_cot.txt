<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input.
The code first initializes an empty list called keys.
It then enters a loop that iterates over the keys of the dictionary d.
For each key k, it appends a string of the form 'k => d[k]' to the list keys.
The code then returns the list keys.

In this case, the input dictionary d is {'-4':'4','1':'2','-':'-3'}.
The code will iterate over the keys of this dictionary, which are '-4', '1', and '-'.
For each key, it will append a string of the form 'k => d[k]' to the list keys.
The resulting list keys will be ['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3'].

<<<Output>>>
['-4 => 4', '1 => 2', '- => -3']
