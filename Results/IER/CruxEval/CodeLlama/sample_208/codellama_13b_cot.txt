<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings as input.
The function iterates over each string in the list and then iterates over each character in the string.
If the character is not a digit, it appends the character to the result list.
The function returns the result list.

In this case, the input list is ['123', 'cat', 'd dee'].
The function iterates over each string in the list and appends the non-digit characters to the result list.
The result list is ['c', 'd', 'd', 'e'].
<<<Output>>>
['c', 'd', 'd', 'e']
