<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary as input, dct.
The function creates an empty list, lst, which will be used to store the key-value pairs of the dictionary.
The function then iterates over the keys of the dictionary, which are sorted in ascending order.
For each key, the function appends a tuple containing the key and its corresponding value to the list, lst.
The function then returns the list, lst.

In this case, the input dictionary is {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}.
The function will iterate over the keys in the order 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
For each key, the function will append a tuple containing the key and its corresponding value to the list, lst.
The final value of lst will be [(a, 1), (b, 2), (c, 3)].
<<<Output>>>
[(a, 1), (b, 2), (c, 3)]
