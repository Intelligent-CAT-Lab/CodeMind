<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string argument text and returns a list of characters sorted by their frequency in the text.
The function first creates an empty dictionary d.
It then iterates over the characters in text, replacing any hyphens with empty strings and converting all characters to lowercase.
For each character in the text, it checks if it is already in the dictionary d. If it is, it increments the corresponding value by 1. If it is not, it sets the value to 1.
After the loop finishes, the function sorts the dictionary by the values in descending order using the sorted() function.
Finally, it returns a list of the values in the dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
['c', 'x', 'y', 'z', '5']
