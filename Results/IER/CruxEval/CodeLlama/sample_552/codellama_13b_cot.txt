<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input.
The function creates an empty dictionary result and iterates over the key-value pairs in d using the items() method.
For each key-value pair, the function checks if the key is a float. If it is, it iterates over the value (which is a list) and adds each element in the list as a key in result with the corresponding value (the float).
If the key is not a float, the function adds the key-value pair as a key-value pair in result.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of result.
<<<Output>>>
{3: 0.76, 6: 0.76, 9: 0.76, 12: 0.76}
