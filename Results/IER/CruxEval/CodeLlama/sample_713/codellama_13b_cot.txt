<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and char.
The function first checks if char is in text.
If it is, it splits text into a list of substrings using char as the delimiter.
It then filters out any empty strings from the list and applies the strip() method to each substring to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
If the resulting list has more than one element, the function returns True.
If the list has only one element or is empty, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
