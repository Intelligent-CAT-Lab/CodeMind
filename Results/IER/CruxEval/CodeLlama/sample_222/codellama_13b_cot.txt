The function f takes two arguments: a string mess and a character char.
The function first finds the last occurrence of char in mess using the rindex method.
It then finds the next occurrence of char in mess starting from the index of the last occurrence.
If the next occurrence is found, it replaces the substring between the last occurrence and the next occurrence with an empty string.
The function repeats this process until the next occurrence is not found.
The function then returns the modified mess.

In this case, the input is '0aabbaa0b' and 'a'.
The function first finds the last occurrence of 'a' in '0aabbaa0b', which is at index 5.
It then finds the next occurrence of 'a' in '0aabbaa0b' starting from index 5, which is at index 7.
It replaces the substring between index 5 and index 7 with an empty string, resulting in '0abba0b'.
It then finds the next occurrence of 'a' in '0abba0b' starting from index 3, which is at index 5.
It replaces the substring between index 3 and index 5 with an empty string, resulting in '0b0b'.
It then finds the next occurrence of 'a' in '0b0b' starting from index 1, which is not found.
The function returns the modified mess, which is '0b0b'.
<<<Output>>>
'0b0b'
