<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: text and width.
The text argument is a string with two lines, separated by a newline character.
The width argument is an integer that represents the desired width of the output string.
The function splits the text argument into lines using the split() method, which returns a list of strings.
The function then iterates over each line in the list and uses the center() method to center the line in a string of width width.
The resulting string is then appended to the result variable, along with a newline character.
The function then removes the very last empty line from the result variable and returns it.

<<<Output>>>
' l\nl '
