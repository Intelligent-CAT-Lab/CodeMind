<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: an array and an element.
The function checks if the element is in the array using the in operator.
If it is, it returns the index of the element in the array using the index method.
If it is not, it returns -1.
In this case, the element 6 is in the array, so the function returns the index of 6, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
