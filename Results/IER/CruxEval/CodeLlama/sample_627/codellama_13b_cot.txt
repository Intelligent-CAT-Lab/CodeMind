<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple consists of a string and an integer.
The function first converts the list of tuples to a dictionary, where the strings are the keys and the integers are the values.
The function then extracts the values from the dictionary and returns them as a list.

In this case, the input list is [('u', 1), ('s', 7), ('u', -5)].
The function first converts this list to a dictionary:
{ 'u': 1, 's': 7, 'u': -5 }
The function then extracts the values from the dictionary:
[1, 7, -5]
The function returns this list as the output.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 7, -5]
