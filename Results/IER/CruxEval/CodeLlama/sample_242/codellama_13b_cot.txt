<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string argument called book.
The function splits the string into two parts using the ":" character as the delimiter.
The first part is stored in a[0] and the second part is stored in a[1].
The function checks if the last word of the first part is the same as the first word of the second part.
If the condition is met, the function calls itself recursively with the concatenation of the first part and the second part.
If the condition is not met, the function returns the original string.

The input string is "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun".
The function splits the string into two parts: "udhv zcvi nhtnfyd" and "erwuyawa pun".
The last word of the first part is "nhtnfyd" and the first word of the second part is "erwuyawa".
The condition is not met, so the function returns the original string.

<<<Output>>>
"udhv zcvi nhtnfyd :erwuyawa pun"
