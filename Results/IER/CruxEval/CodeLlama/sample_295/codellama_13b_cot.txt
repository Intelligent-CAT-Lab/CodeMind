<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of fruits as input.
The code checks if the last element of the list is equal to the first element of the list.
If they are equal, the function returns the string 'no'.
If they are not equal, the code removes the first and last elements of the list, and then returns the modified list.
The modified list will have the first and last elements removed, and the remaining elements will be shifted to the left.
The return value of the function will be the modified list.
<<<Output>>>
['apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'pear', 'orange']
