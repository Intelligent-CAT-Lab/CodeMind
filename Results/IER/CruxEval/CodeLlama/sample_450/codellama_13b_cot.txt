<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and splits it into a list of words using the split() method.
The list is then iterated over in steps of 2, starting from the second element (index 1).
For each element, the join() method is used to reverse the word and join it with the previous element.
The resulting list is then joined back into a string using the join() method.

The input string 'K zBK' is split into ['K', 'zBK'].
The first element 'K' is not modified.
The second element 'zBK' is reversed to 'BKz' and joined with the previous element 'K' to form the string 'K BKz'.
The resulting string is 'K BKz'.
<<<Output>>>
K BKz
