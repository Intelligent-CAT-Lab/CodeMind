The variable name is initialized to '.NET'.
The code then reverses the string using the slice notation [::-1]. This results in the string 'T.E.T.N.O.'.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the reversed string.
For each character n in the string, it checks if n is not a period and if the number of periods in the new_name string is less than 2. If both conditions are met, it appends n to the front of new_name. If either condition is not met, it breaks out of the loop.
The loop iterates over the characters in the reversed string, and the conditions are met for the first 4 characters (T, E, T, and N). The loop then breaks out of the loop because the number of periods in new_name is 2.
The code then returns the final value of new_name, which is 'TNET'.
<<<Output>>>
'TNET'
