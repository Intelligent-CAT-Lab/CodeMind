<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input.
The first line of the function checks if the input string is empty or if the first character of the string is not a digit. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns the string 'INVALID'.
If the input string is not empty and the first character is a digit, the function enters a loop that iterates over the characters of the string.
For each character in the string, the function multiplies the current value of cur by 10 and adds the integer value of the current character to cur.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the string representation of the final value of cur.

In this case, the input string is '3', which is not empty and the first character is a digit. The loop iterates once, and the final value of cur is 3.
The function returns the string representation of cur, which is '3'.
