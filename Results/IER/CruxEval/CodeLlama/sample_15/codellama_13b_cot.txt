<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: text, wrong, and right.
The function first replaces all occurrences of wrong in text with right using the replace() method.
The function then converts the resulting string to uppercase using the upper() method.
The function returns the resulting string.

In this case, the function would replace all occurrences of "h" in "zn kgd jw lnt" with "u", resulting in "znu kgdu jw lnt".
The function would then convert this string to uppercase, resulting in "ZNU KGDU JW LNT".
The function would return this string as its output.
<<<Output>>>
ZNU KGDU JW LNT
