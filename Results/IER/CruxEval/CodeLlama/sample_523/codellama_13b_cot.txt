<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and returns a string.
The code first converts the input string to a list of characters using the list() function.
The code then iterates over the list of characters in reverse order using the range() function.
For each character in the list, the code checks if it is a space character using the isspace() method.
If it is a space character, the code replaces it with the HTML entity for a non-breaking space (&nbsp;).
The code then joins the list of characters back into a string using the join() method.

The input string '   ' contains only spaces, so the code will replace all of them with &nbsp;.
The return value of the function will be the string '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'.
<<<Output>>>
'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'
