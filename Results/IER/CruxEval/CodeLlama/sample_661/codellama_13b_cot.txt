<<<Analysis>>>
The variable letters is initialized to 'elrts,SS ee', and maxsplit is initialized to 6.
The code then splits the string into a list of words using the split() method, which returns ['elrts', 'SS', 'ee'].
The code then joins the last 6 elements of this list using the join() method, which returns 'SS ee'.
<<<Output>>>
'SS ee'
