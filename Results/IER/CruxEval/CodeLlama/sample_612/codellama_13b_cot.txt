<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns a new dictionary with the same key-value pairs as d.
The code uses the items() method to get a list of key-value pairs from the dictionary d.
The list is then passed to the dict() constructor to create a new dictionary with the same key-value pairs as d.
The new dictionary is then returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
{'a': 42, 'b': 1337, 'c': -1, 'd': 5}
