<<<Analysis>>>
The code first checks if the input sentence is empty. If it is, it returns an empty string.
If the sentence is not empty, it replaces all occurrences of '(' and ')' with an empty string.
It then capitalizes the first letter of the sentence and replaces all spaces with an empty string.
The final sentence is then returned.

Based on this analysis, the return value of `f('(A (b B))')` would be `'A(bB)'`.
<<<Output>>>
'A(bB)'
