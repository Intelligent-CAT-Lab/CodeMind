<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and splits it into a list of words using the split() method.
The code then iterates over each word in the list and checks if it ends with the substring "day".
If it does, the code adds the substring "y" to the end of the word. If it doesn't, the code adds the substring "day" to the end of the word.
The code then appends the modified word to a new list called result.
Finally, the code joins the words in the result list back into a string using the join() method and returns the result.

<<<Output>>>
"nwv mef ofme bdryl y"
