<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes three arguments: text, space_symbol, and size.
The text argument is initialized to 'w', which is a string with a single character.
The space_symbol argument is initialized to '))', which is a string with two characters.
The size argument is initialized to 7, which is an integer.
The function first calculates the length of the text argument, which is 1.
It then calculates the difference between the size argument and the length of the text argument, which is 6.
It then uses a for loop to create a string of space_symbol repeated size-len(text) times, which is '))' repeated 6 times.
It then concatenates the text argument with the spaces string and returns the result.
The return value of the function is 'w))))))))'.
<<<Output>>>
'w))))))))'
