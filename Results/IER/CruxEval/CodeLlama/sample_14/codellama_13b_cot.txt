The variable s is initialized to '   OOP   ', which is a string with spaces at the beginning and end.
The code first strips the spaces from the string using the strip() method, which returns a new string with the spaces removed.
The code then reverses the string using the reverse() method, which returns a new list with the characters in reverse order.
Finally, the code joins the characters in the list using the join() method, which returns a new string with the characters separated by spaces.
The return value of the code is therefore 'PPOO   '.
<<<Output>>>
'PPOO   '
