<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: nums, which is a list of numbers, and rmvalue, which is the value to be removed from the list.
The function first creates a copy of the list nums and assigns it to the variable res.
The function then enters a loop that iterates while rmvalue is in res.
For each iteration, the function uses the index method to find the index of the first occurrence of rmvalue in res.
The function then uses the pop method to remove the element at that index from res.
If the element removed is not equal to rmvalue, the function appends it to the end of res.
The function repeats this process until rmvalue is no longer in res.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of res.
<<<Output>>>
[6, 2, 1, 1, 4]
