<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the count of a number and the number itself.
The function first initializes an empty list called output.
It then iterates through the input list nums and for each number n, it counts the number of times n appears in nums and appends a tuple containing the count and n to output.
The function then sorts the output list in descending order based on the first element of each tuple (i.e., the count).
Finally, the function returns the sorted output list.

<<<Output>>>
[(3, 1), (2, 3), (1, 1)]
