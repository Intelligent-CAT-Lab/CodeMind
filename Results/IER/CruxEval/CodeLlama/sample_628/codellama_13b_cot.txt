<<<Analysis>>>
The variable nums is initialized to [4, 5, 3, 6, 1], and the variable delete is initialized to 5.
The code then calls the remove() method on the nums list, passing in the value of delete (5) as an argument.
This will remove the first occurrence of 5 from the list, resulting in the list [4, 3, 6, 1].
The code then returns the modified list, which is [4, 3, 6, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 3, 6, 1]
