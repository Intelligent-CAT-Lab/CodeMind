The function f takes one argument: x.
The function first checks if x is greater than 0. If it is, it calls itself with the argument x-1.
If x is not greater than 0, the function returns 0.

In this case, the argument x is 5.
The function will call itself with the argument 4, which is greater than 0.
The function will then call itself with the argument 3, which is also greater than 0.
The function will continue to call itself with the argument 2, which is also greater than 0.
The function will then call itself with the argument 1, which is greater than 0.
The function will then call itself with the argument 0, which is not greater than 0.
The function will return 0.

The function will then return the sum of all the values it returned, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 0 = 10.

The print statement will print the return value of the function, which is 10.
