<<<Analysis>>>
The variable orig is initialized to [1, 2, 3].
The variable copy is initialized to orig, which is [1, 2, 3].
The code appends 100 to copy, which is now [1, 2, 3, 100].
The code pops the last element from orig, which is 3, and returns the new value of orig, which is now [1, 2].
The code returns copy, which is [1, 2, 3, 100].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 100]
