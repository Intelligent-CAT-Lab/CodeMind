<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to 'wdj'.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of text (which is 3).
For each character i in the text, it calculates the length of the substring of text that comes before the character i.
The code then adds the length of this substring to the variable s.
The loop finishes and the code returns the final value of s, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
