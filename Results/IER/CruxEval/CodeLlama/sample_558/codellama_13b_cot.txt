<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: nums and mos.
nums is a list of integers, and mos is a list of integers.
The function first iterates over the elements of mos and removes each element from nums using the pop() method.
After removing all the elements of mos from nums, the function sorts the remaining elements of nums using the sort() method.
The function then iterates over the elements of mos again and adds each element to the end of nums using the += operator.
Finally, the function iterates over the elements of nums and checks if each element is greater than the next element. If it finds an element that is not greater than the next element, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
