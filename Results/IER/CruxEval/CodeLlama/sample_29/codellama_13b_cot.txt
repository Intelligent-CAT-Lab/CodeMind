<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string argument text.
The function first filters the string text to extract only the numeric characters using the filter function and the str.isnumeric method.
The filtered list of numeric characters is stored in the variable nums.
The function then asserts that the length of the list nums is greater than 0.
Finally, the function returns the joined string of the list nums using the join method.

The input to the function is the string '-123   \t+314'.
The function first filters the string to extract only the numeric characters, which are '123' and '314'.
The function then asserts that the length of the list nums is greater than 0, which is true.
Finally, the function returns the joined string of the list nums, which is '123314'.
<<<Output>>>
'123314'
