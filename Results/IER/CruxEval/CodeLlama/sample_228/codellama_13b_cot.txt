<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: text and splitter.
The text argument is a string that contains the text to be processed.
The splitter argument is a string that contains the character to be used as a separator.
The function first converts the text to lowercase using the lower() method.
Then it splits the text into a list of words using the split() method.
Finally, it joins the list of words using the join() method, with the separator specified by the splitter argument.
The return value of the function is the resulting string.
