<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and iterates through each character in the string using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if the character is uppercase and if the previous character is lowercase.
If both conditions are met, the function returns True.
The loop iterates through the entire string, so if the function returns True for any character, it will return True for the entire string.
If the function returns False for all characters, it will return False.
<<<Output>>>
True
