The function f takes two arguments: nums, which is a list of numbers, and number, which is a single number.
The function returns the number of times the number appears in the list.
In this case, the list nums is [12, 0, 13, 4, 12], and the number is 12.
The function counts the number of times 12 appears in the list, which is twice.
