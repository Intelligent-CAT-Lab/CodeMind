The code defines a function f that takes a string argument text.
The function first replaces all spaces in text with an empty string using the replace method.
The function then replaces all zeros in text with spaces using the replace method.
The function then replaces all ones in text with the letter i using the replace method.
The function then returns the modified text.

The code then defines a global variable g and a local variable field.
The function f is then called with the argument '00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110'.
The function f modifies the text argument by replacing spaces with zeros, zeros with spaces, and ones with the letter i.
The modified text is then returned by the function.

The return value of the function f is the modified text 'i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0i0
