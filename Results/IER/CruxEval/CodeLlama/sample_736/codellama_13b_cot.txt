The function f takes two arguments: text and insert.
The text argument is a string, and the insert argument is a string that will be used to replace any whitespace characters in the text string.
The function first defines a set of whitespace characters, which includes the following characters:
\t (tab), \r (carriage return), \v (vertical tab), ' ' (space), \f (form feed), and \n (newline).
The function then initializes an empty string called clean.
The function then iterates over each character in the text string using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if the character is in the set of whitespace characters. If it is, it adds the insert string to the clean string. If it is not, it adds the character to the clean string.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the clean string.
