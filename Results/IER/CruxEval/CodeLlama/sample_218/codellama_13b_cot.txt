<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a string and a separator.
The function first counts the number of times the separator appears in the string using the count method.
The function then returns a new string that is the original string concatenated with the separator, repeated the number of times the separator appeared in the original string.
The function then returns the reversed version of this new string.

In this case, the string is 'caabcfcabfc' and the separator is 'ab'.
The function first counts the number of times 'ab' appears in the string, which is 3.
It then returns the string 'caabcfcabfcabababab' (the original string concatenated with 'ab' three times) and then reverses it to get 'cababababcaabcfc'.

<<<Output>>>
cababababcaabcfc
