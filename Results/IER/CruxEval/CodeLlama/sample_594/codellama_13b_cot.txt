<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string argument file.
The function returns the index of the first newline character in the string file plus 1.
The string file is passed as an argument to the function, and it contains the following characters:
"n wez szize lnson tilebi it 504n.\n"
The newline character is the last character in the string, so the function returns its index plus 1, which is 26.
<<<Output>>>
26
