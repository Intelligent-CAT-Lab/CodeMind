<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: nums, idx, and added.
nums is a list of numbers, idx is the index at which the added number will be inserted, and added is the number that will be inserted.
The function first inserts the added number at the specified index using the slicing notation nums[idx:idx] = (added,).
This creates a new list with the added number inserted at the specified index.
The function then returns the modified list.

In this case, the function is called with the arguments [2, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2, and 3.
The function will insert the number 3 at index 2, resulting in the list [2, 2, 3, 2, 3].
The function will then return this modified list.

<<<Output>>>
[2, 2, 3, 2, 3]
