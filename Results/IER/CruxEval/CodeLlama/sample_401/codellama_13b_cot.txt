<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: text and suffix.
The function checks if suffix is not empty and if text ends with suffix.
If the condition is met, the function returns the text with the suffix removed.
If the condition is not met, the function returns the original text.
In this case, the condition is not met because the text 'mathematics' does not end with the suffix 'example'.
The function returns the original text, which is 'mathematics'.
<<<Output>>>
mathematics
