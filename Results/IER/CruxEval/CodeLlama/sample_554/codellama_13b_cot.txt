<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array arr as input and returns a new array with the elements of arr in reverse order.
The function uses the built-in reversed function to reverse the order of the elements in arr.
The reversed function returns an iterator that iterates over the elements of arr in reverse order.
The list function is used to convert the iterator to a list.
The return value of the function is the list of elements in arr in reverse order.
<<<Output>>>
