<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input.
The code first iterates over the list of numbers using a for loop.
For each number in the list, it checks if the number is odd by using the modulo operator (%).
If the number is odd, it removes it from the list using the remove() method.
The code then calculates the sum of the remaining numbers in the list using a for loop.
The sum is returned at the end of the function.

In this case, the input list is [11, 21, 0, 11].
The code will iterate over the list and remove the odd numbers 11 and 21.
The remaining numbers in the list are 0 and 11.
The sum of these numbers is 11.

<<<Output>>>
11
