The variable x is initialized to '1', which is a string with a single character.
The variable n is initialized to the length of x, which is 1.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than n and the character at position i in x is a digit.
The condition is met when i is 0 and the character at position 0 in x is '1', which is a digit.
The loop increments i to 1 and checks the condition again.
The condition is not met because i is now 1 and the character at position 1 in x is not a digit.
The loop exits and the code returns the value of i == n, which is True.
<<<Output>>>
True
