<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: n, m, and text.
The function first checks if the text is empty, and if it is, it returns the text.
If the text is not empty, the function splits the text into three parts: head, mid, and tail.
The head is the first character of the text, the mid is the text without the first and last characters, and the tail is the last character of the text.
The function then replaces all occurrences of n with m in the head, mid, and tail.
Finally, the function joins the head, mid, and tail together and returns the result.

In this case, the input to the function is "x", "$", and "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris".
The function first checks if the text is empty, and since it is not, it splits the text into three parts: "2", "xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris", and "s".
It then replaces all occurrences of "x" with "$" in the head, mid, and tail, resulting in "2", "$xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris", and "s".
Finally, it joins the head, mid, and tail together, resulting in "$2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris$".

<<<Output>>>
$2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris$
