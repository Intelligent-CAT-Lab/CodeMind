You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, search_string):
    indexes = []
    while search_string in text:
        indexes.append(text.rindex(search_string))
        text = text[:text.rindex(search_string)]
    return indexes
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f('ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ', 'J')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a string search_string. It returns a list of indexes where the search_string is found in the text.

The function works by using a while loop that continues until the search_string is no longer found in the text. In each iteration of the loop, it finds the last index of the search_string in the text, appends it to the list of indexes, and then removes everything from the text up to and including the found index.

For the input 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ', 'J', the function will find the last index of 'J' in the text, which is 25, append it to the list of indexes, and then remove everything from the text up to and including the found index. The text becomes 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPN'.

The function continues to find and remove 'J' from the text until 'J' is no longer found. The indexes of all 'J's in the text are appended to the list of indexes, and the function returns the list of indexes.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ', 'J' is [25, 22, 19, 16, 13, 10, 7, 4, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[25, 22, 19, 16, 13, 10, 7, 4, 1]
