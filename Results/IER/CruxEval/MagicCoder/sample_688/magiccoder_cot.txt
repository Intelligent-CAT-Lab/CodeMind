You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    l = []
    for i in nums:
        if i not in l:
            l.append(i)
    return l
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input. It initializes an empty list l. Then it iterates over each number in nums. If the number is not already in l, it appends the number to l. Finally, it returns l.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8], we need to iterate over the numbers in the list and append each number to l only if it is not already in l.

In the given list [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8], the numbers 3, 1, 9, 0, 2, and 8 are not repeated. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 0, 8] is [3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[3, 1, 9, 0, 2, 8]
