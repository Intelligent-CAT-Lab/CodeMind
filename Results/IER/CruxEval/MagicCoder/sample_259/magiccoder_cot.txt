You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    new_text = []
    for character in text:
        if character.isupper():
            new_text.insert(len(new_text) // 2, character)
    if len(new_text) == 0:
        new_text = ['-']
    return ''.join(new_text)

The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string.

The function iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is an uppercase letter, it is inserted into the new_text list at the middle index.

If the new_text list is empty after processing all characters, it is filled with a '-'.

The function then joins all characters in the new_text list into a single string and returns it.

The input string 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.' is processed as follows:

- 'S' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 't' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 'r' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 'i' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 'n' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 'g' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
-'m' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 'a' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 'i' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 'b' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 'p' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 'R' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 'e' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 'x' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 'l' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 'i' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- 'b' is an uppercase letter, so it is inserted at the middle index of new_text.
- '.' is not an uppercase letter, so it is not inserted into new_text.

The new_text list is ['S', 't', 'R', 'i', 'a', 'i', 'b', 'R', 'e', 'x', 'i', 'b'], so the output of the function f on the input 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.' is 'SitRaiibRexiib'.
<<<Output>>>
'SitRaiibRexiib'
