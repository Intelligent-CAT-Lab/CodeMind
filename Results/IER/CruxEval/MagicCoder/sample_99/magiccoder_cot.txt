You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, sep, num):
    return '___'.join(text.rsplit(sep, num))
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f('aa+++bb', '+', 1)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a string text, a separator sep, and a number num. The function splits the string text using the separator sep, and then joins the resulting list of strings with '___'. The split operation is performed num times.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'aa+++bb', '+', 1, we need to split 'aa+++bb' using '+' once, and then join the resulting list of strings with '___'.

The split operation results in ['aa', 'bb'], and the join operation results in 'aa___bb'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'aa+++bb', '+', 1 is 'aa___bb'.
<<<Output>>>
'aa___bb'
