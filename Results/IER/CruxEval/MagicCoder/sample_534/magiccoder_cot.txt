You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(sequence, value):
    i = max(sequence.index(value) - len(sequence) // 3, 0)
    result = ''
    for j, v in enumerate(sequence[i:]):
        if v == '+':
            result += value
        else:
            result += sequence[i + j]
    return result

[Question]
What would be the return value of`f('hosu', 'o')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The function f takes a sequence and a value as input. It first finds the index of the value in the sequence. Then it iterates over the sequence starting from the index found. If the current value is '+', it appends the value to the result. Otherwise, it appends the current value in the sequence to the result.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'hosu', 'o', we need to find the index of 'o' in 'hosu'. Then, starting from that index, we iterate over the sequence. If the current value is '+', we append 'o' to the result. Otherwise, we append the current value in the sequence to the result.

In the sequence 'hosu', the index of 'o' is 1. Therefore, we start iterating from index 1. The first value is 'o', which is '+'. So, we append 'o' to the result. The second value is's', which is not '+'. So, we append's' to the result. The third value is 'u', which is not '+'. So, we append 'u' to the result.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'hosu', 'o' is 'oosu'.
<<<Output>>>
'oosu'
