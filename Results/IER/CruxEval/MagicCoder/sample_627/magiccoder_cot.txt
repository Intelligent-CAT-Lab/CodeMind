I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(parts):
    return list(dict(parts).values())
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([('u', 1), ('s', 7), ('u', -5)])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of tuples parts as input. Each tuple contains a string and an integer. The function returns a list of the integers from the input list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [('u', 1), ('s', 7), ('u', -5)], we need to extract the integers from the tuples and return them as a list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [('u', 1), ('s', 7), ('u', -5)] is [1, 7, -5].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 7, -5]
