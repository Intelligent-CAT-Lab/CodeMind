I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    result = array.copy()
    while result:
        key, value = result.popitem()
        if elem == key or elem == value:
            result.update(array)
        del result[key]
    return result
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f({}, 1)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The function f takes a dictionary array and an element elem as input. It creates a copy of the input dictionary and then iterates over the copy. For each key-value pair in the copy, it checks if the element equals either the key or the value. If it does, it adds all the key-value pairs from the original dictionary back to the copy. Then it removes the current key-value pair from the copy. The function returns the final copy.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {}, 1, we need to create a copy of the input dictionary and then iterate over it. Since the input dictionary is empty, there are no key-value pairs to iterate over. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {}, 1 is an empty dictionary {}.
