I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, substr, occ):
    n = 0
    while True:
        i = text.rfind(substr)
        if i == -1:
            break
        elif n == occ:
            return i
        else:
            n += 1
            text = text[:i]
    return -1
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f('zjegiymjc', 'j', 2)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, substr, and occ. It initializes a counter n to 0 and then enters a loop. In each iteration of the loop, it finds the last occurrence of substr in text and checks if it is the occ-th occurrence. If it is, it returns the index of the occurrence. If it is not, it increments the counter n and updates text to be everything before the occurrence. If it cannot find the substr in text, it breaks out of the loop and returns -1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ('zjegiymjc', 'j', 2), we need to find the 2nd occurrence of 'j' in 'zjegiymjc'.

The 2nd occurrence of 'j' in 'zjegiymjc' is at index 5.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ('zjegiymjc', 'j', 2) is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
