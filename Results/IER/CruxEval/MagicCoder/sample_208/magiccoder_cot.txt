You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        for d in item:
            if not d.isdigit():
                result.append(d)
    return result
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f(['123', 'cat', 'd dee'])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

{YOUR ANALYSIS}

The function f takes a list of strings as input. It initializes an empty list result. Then it iterates over each string in the input list. For each string, it iterates over each character in the string. If the character is not a digit, it appends the character to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['123', 'cat', 'd dee'], we need to iterate over each string in the list, then iterate over each character in the string. If the character is not a digit, we append it to the result list.

For the first string '123', we skip it because it contains only digits. For the second string 'cat', we append 'c' and 'a' to the result list because they are not digits. For the third string 'd dee', we append 'd' and'' to the result list because they are not digits.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ['123', 'cat', 'd dee'] is ['c', 'a', 'd',''].
<<<Output>>>
['c', 'a', 'd','']
