You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    text = text.split(' ')
    for t in text:
        if not t.isnumeric():
            return 'no'
    return 'yes'

[Question]
What would be the return value of`f('03625163633 d')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string text as input. The function splits the string into a list of words using the split() method. Then it checks each word in the list. If any word is not numeric, it returns 'no'. If all words are numeric, it returns 'yes'.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input '03625163633 d', we need to split the string into words, check if each word is numeric, and return the appropriate result.

The string '03625163633 d' is split into the words ['03625163633', 'd']. The first word '03625163633' is numeric, so the function returns 'yes'.
<<<Output>>>
'yes'
