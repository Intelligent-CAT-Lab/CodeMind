You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(string):
    while string:
        if string[-1].isalpha():
            return string
        string = string[:-1]
    return string
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f('--4/0-209')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and returns the string without its trailing alphabetic characters.

The function f starts by checking if the last character of the string is alphabetic. If it is, the function returns the string. If it isn't, the function removes the last character from the string and checks again. This process continues until it finds an alphabetic character or the string becomes empty.

In the case of the input '--4/0-209', the function will return '--4/0-20'. The function checks the last character, which is '9', and since it's not alphabetic, it removes it and checks the next character, which is '0', which is alphabetic, so it returns '--4/0'.
<<<Output>>>
'--4/0'
