You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(list_x):
    item_count = len(list_x)
    new_list = []
    for i in range(item_count):
        new_list.append(list_x.pop())
    return new_list
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([5, 8, 6, 8, 4])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list list_x as input. It first calculates the length of the list using the len() function. Then it creates an empty list new_list.

The function then enters a loop that runs for the number of items in the list. In each iteration of the loop, it pops the last item from the list_x and appends it to the new_list.

The function finally returns the new_list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 6, 8, 4], we need to pop the last item from the list and append it to the new_list until the list is empty.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 8, 6, 8, 4] is [4, 8, 6, 8, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 8, 6, 8, 5]
