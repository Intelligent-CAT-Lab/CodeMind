You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        nums.insert(i, nums[i]**2)
    return nums
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([1, 2, 4])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input. It then iterates over the list, inserting the square of each number at the current index.

For example, if the input is [1, 2, 4], the first iteration will insert the square of 1 (1^2 = 1) at index 0, resulting in [1, 1, 2, 4].

The second iteration will insert the square of 2 (2^2 = 4) at index 1, resulting in [1, 4, 1, 2, 4].

The third iteration will insert the square of 4 (4^2 = 16) at index 2, resulting in [1, 4, 16, 1, 2, 4].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 4] is [1, 4, 16, 1, 2, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 16, 1, 2, 4]
