You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    count = len(nums)
    for i in range(0, count):
        nums.insert(i, nums[i]*2)
    return nums
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([2, 8, -2, 9, 3, 3])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input. It first calculates the length of the list, which is stored in the variable count. Then, it iterates over the list, doubling each number and inserting it at the current index. Finally, it returns the modified list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [2, 8, -2, 9, 3, 3], we need to double each number in the list and insert the doubled number at the current index.

For example, for the first number 2, we double it to 4 and insert it at the beginning of the list. The list becomes [4, 2, 8, -2, 9, 3, 3].

For the second number 8, we double it to 16 and insert it at the second index of the list. The list becomes [4, 16, 2, 8, -2, 9, 3, 3].

And so on, until we have processed all the numbers in the list.

The final output of executing the function f on the input [2, 8, -2, 9, 3, 3] is [4, 16, 2, 16, -4, 18, 6, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 16, 2, 16, -4, 18, 6, 6]
