You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(items, target):
    if target in items:
        return items.index(target)
    return -1
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f(['''1''', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+'], '**')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of items and a target as input. It checks if the target is in the list of items. If the target is in the list, it returns the index of the target in the list. If the target is not in the list, it returns -1.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ['1', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+'], '**', we need to find the index of '**' in the list.

The index of '**' in the list is 3, so the output of executing the function f on the input ['1', '+', '-', '**', '//', '*', '+'], '**' is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
