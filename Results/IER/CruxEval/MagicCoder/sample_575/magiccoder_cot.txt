You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, val):
    new_list = []
    [new_list.extend([i] * val) for i in nums]
    return sum(new_list)
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([10, 4], 3)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums and a value val as input. It creates a new list new_list and then for each number in nums, it extends new_list by adding val copies of that number. Finally, it returns the sum of all numbers in new_list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [10, 4] and 3, we need to create a new list by repeating each number in the input list [10, 4] three times, and then summing all the numbers in the new list.

So, the new list would be [10, 10, 10, 4, 4, 4]. The sum of this list is 38.
<<<Output>>>
38
