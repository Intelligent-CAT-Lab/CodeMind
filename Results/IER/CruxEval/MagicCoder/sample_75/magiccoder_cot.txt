You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    ind = array.index(elem)
    return ind * 2 + array[-ind - 1] * 3
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array and an element as input. It first finds the index of the element in the array using the index() method. Then it calculates the result as the index multiplied by 2 plus the element at the negative index of the found index multiplied by 3.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 1, -8, 2] and 2, we need to find the index of 2 in the array, which is 1. Then we calculate the result as 1 * 2 + (-1) * 3 = -1 + 3 = 2.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 1, -8, 2] and 2 is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
