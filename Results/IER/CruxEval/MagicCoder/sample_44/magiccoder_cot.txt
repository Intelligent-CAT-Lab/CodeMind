You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    ls = list(text)
    for i in range(0, len(ls)):
        if ls[i]!='+':
            ls.insert(i, '+')
            ls.insert(i, '*')
            break
    return '+'.join(ls)

The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string.

The function f first converts the input string into a list of characters. Then, it iterates over the list. If it encounters a character that is not '+', it inserts '*' and '+' at the current position in the list. The break statement is used to stop the iteration after the first non-'+' character is found.

Finally, the function joins the list of characters back into a string with '+' as the separator and returns the result.

For the input 'nzoh', the function will insert '*' and '+' before the first non-'+' character, which is 'n'. So, the output of executing the function f on the input 'nzoh' is '*+n+z+o+h'.
<<<Output>>>
'*+n+z+o+h'
