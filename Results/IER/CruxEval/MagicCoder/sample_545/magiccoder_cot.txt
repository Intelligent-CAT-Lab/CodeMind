You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    result = []
    index = 0
    while index < len(array):
        result.append(array.pop())
        index += 2
    return result
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list array as input. It creates an empty list result and initializes an index to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues until the index is less than the length of the array.

Inside the loop, it appends the last element of the array to the result list using the pop() method, which removes and returns the last element of the list. The index is then incremented by 2.

Finally, the function returns the result list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8], we need to remove and append every other element from the end of the list to a new list.

The output of executing the function f on the input [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8] is [-1, 8, 2, 8, -4, 8, 8, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[-1, 8, 2, 8, -4, 8, 8, 8]
