You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, pop1, pop2):
    nums.pop(pop1 - 1)
    nums.pop(pop2 - 1)
    return nums
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([1, 5, 2, 3, 6], 2, 4)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three arguments: a list of numbers nums, and two integers pop1 and pop2. It removes the elements at the positions pop1 and pop2 from the list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 2, 3, 6], 2, 4, we need to remove the elements at the positions 2 and 4 from the list [1, 5, 2, 3, 6].

The positions in the list are 1-indexed, so the second element is at position 2 and the fourth element is at position 4.

After removing the elements at the positions 2 and 4, the list becomes [1, 2, 3].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 5, 2, 3, 6], 2, 4 is [1, 2, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3]
