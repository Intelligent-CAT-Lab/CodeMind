I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    position = len(text)
    if char in text:
        position = text.index(char)
        if position > 1:
            position = (position + 1) % len(text)
    return position

[Question]
What would be the return value of`f('wduhzxlfk', 'w')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a character char. It first checks if the character char is in the string text. If it is, it finds the position of the character in the string and then calculates the position of the next character in the string. If the position is greater than 1, it calculates the position modulo the length of the string. If the character is not in the string, it returns the length of the string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'wduhzxlfk' and 'w', we first check if 'w' is in 'wduhzxlfk'. Since it is, we find the position of 'w' in 'wduhzxlfk' which is 0. Then we calculate the position of the next character in 'wduhzxlfk' which is 1. Since 1 is greater than 1, we calculate the position modulo the length of 'wduhzxlfk' which is 1. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'wduhzxlfk' and 'w' is 1.
