You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(values, text, markers):
    return text.rstrip(values).rstrip(markers)
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f('2Pn', 'yCxpg2C2Pny2', '')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: values, text, and markers.
The function rstrip removes trailing characters (characters at the end of a string).
The function rstrip(values) removes trailing characters in values from the text.
The function rstrip(markers) removes trailing characters in markers from the text.

In the given function call f('2Pn', 'yCxpg2C2Pny2', ''), the function rstrip('2Pn') removes trailing '2' and 'P' from 'yCxpg2C2Pny2'. The result is 'yCxpgCny2'.
Then, the function rstrip('') removes nothing from 'yCxpgCny2', so the result is 'yCxpgCny2'.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '2Pn', 'yCxpg2C2Pny2', '' is 'yCxpgCny2'.
<<<Output>>>
'yCxpgCny2'
