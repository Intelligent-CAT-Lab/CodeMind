You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(d, l):
	new_d = {}

	for k in l:
		if d.get(k) is not None:
			new_d[k] = d[k]

	return new_d.copy()
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f({"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}, ["lorem ipsum", "dolor"])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

@@ Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments: a dictionary d and a list l. It creates a new dictionary new_d and then iterates over the list l. For each key in l, it checks if the key exists in the dictionary d. If it does, it adds the key-value pair from d to new_d. Finally, it returns a copy of new_d.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23} and ["lorem ipsum", "dolor"], we need to check if each key in the list exists in the dictionary. Since both "lorem ipsum" and "dolor" exist in the dictionary, they are added to the new_d dictionary.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23} and ["lorem ipsum", "dolor"] is {"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}.
<<<Output>>>
{'lorem ipsum': 12, 'dolor': 23}
