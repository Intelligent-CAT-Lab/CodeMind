You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, sub):
    index = []
    starting = 0
    while starting != -1:
        starting = text.find(sub, starting)
        if starting != -1:
            index.append(starting)
            starting += len(sub)
    return index

What would be the return value of`f('egmdartoa', 'good')`?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a string sub. It returns a list of indices where the substring sub is found in the string text.

The function works by using the find method of the string class in Python. The find method returns the lowest index of the substring (if found). If it's not found, it returns -1.

The function starts by initializing an empty list index and a variable starting to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues until starting is -1.

Inside the loop, it finds the index of the substring sub in the string text starting from the index starting. If the substring is found, it appends the index to the list index and updates starting to be the index of the next character after the found substring. If the substring is not found, starting becomes -1 and the loop ends.

The function finally returns the list index.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'egmdartoa' and 'good', we need to find the indices of 'good' in 'egmdartoa'.

The indices of 'good' in 'egmdartoa' are 0, 5, and 6. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'egmdartoa' and 'good' is [0, 5, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 5, 6]
