I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    new_text = text
    a = []
    while char in new_text:
        a.append(new_text.index(char))
        new_text = new_text.replace(char,"",1)
    return a
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f('rvr', 'r')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a string text and a character char. It creates an empty list a and a copy of the input string new_text. It then enters a while loop that continues until the character char is not found in new_text. In each iteration of the loop, it appends the index of the first occurrence of char in new_text to list a, and then replaces the first occurrence of char in new_text with an empty string.

When the function is called with the inputs 'rvr' and 'r', it will continue to remove all occurrences of 'r' from 'rvr' and append the index of each occurrence to the list a. The first occurrence of 'r' in 'rvr' is at index 0, so the first element of the list a will be 0. The second occurrence of 'r' in 'rvr' is at index 2, so the second element of the list a will be 2. The third occurrence of 'r' in 'rvr' is at index 3, so the third element of the list a will be 3. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the inputs 'rvr' and 'r' is [0, 2, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 2, 3]
