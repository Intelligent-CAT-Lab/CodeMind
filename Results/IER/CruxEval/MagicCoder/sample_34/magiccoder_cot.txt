You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, odd1, odd2):
    while odd1 in nums:
        nums.remove(odd1)
    while odd2 in nums:
        nums.remove(odd2)
    return nums
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3], 3, 1)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums, and two odd numbers odd1 and odd2 as input. It removes all occurrences of odd1 and odd2 from nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3], 3, 1, we need to remove all occurrences of 3 and 1 from the list.

The first while loop removes all occurrences of 3 from the list. After the first loop, the list becomes [1, 2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3].

The second while loop removes all occurrences of 1 from the list. After the second loop, the list becomes [2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 3, 21, 3].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 21, 1, 3], 3, 1 is [2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 3, 21, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2, 5, 3, 21, 3]
