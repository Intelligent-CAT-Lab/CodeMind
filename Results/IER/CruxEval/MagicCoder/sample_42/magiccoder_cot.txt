You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

def f(nums):
    nums.clear()
    for num in nums:
        nums.append(num*2)
    return nums

[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a list of numbers nums as input. It first clears the list nums. Then, it iterates over each number in nums, doubles the number, and appends the doubled number to nums. Finally, it returns the modified list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2], we need to clear the list, then double each number in the list, and finally return the modified list.

The list [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2] is initially passed to the function f.

1. The function f is called with the list [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2].
2. The list nums is cleared, so nums becomes an empty list.
3. The function f iterates over each number in nums.
4. The first number in nums is 4. 4 is doubled, so 4 becomes 8.
5. The second number in nums is 3. 3 is doubled, so 3 becomes 6.
6. The third number in nums is 2. 2 is doubled, so 2 becomes 4.
7. The fourth number in nums is 1. 1 is doubled, so 1 becomes 2.
8. The fifth number in nums is 2. 2 is doubled, so 2 becomes 4.
9. The sixth number in nums is -1. -1 is doubled, so -1 becomes -2.
10. The seventh number in nums is 4. 4 is doubled, so 4 becomes 8.
11. The eighth number in nums is 2. 2 is doubled, so 2 becomes 4.
12. The function f returns the modified list [8, 6, 4, 2, 4, -2, 8, 4].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, -1, 4, 2] is [8, 6, 4, 2, 4, -2, 8, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[8, 6, 4, 2, 4, -2, 8, 4]
