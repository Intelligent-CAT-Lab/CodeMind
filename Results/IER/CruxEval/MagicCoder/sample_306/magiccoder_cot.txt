I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    digits = []
    for num in nums:
        if (isinstance(num, str) and num.isnumeric()) or isinstance(num, int):
            digits.append(num)
    digits = list(map(int, digits))
    return digits

[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([0, 6, '1', '2', 0])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a list of numbers as input. It initializes an empty list digits. Then it iterates over each number in the input list. If the number is a string that can be converted to an integer (i.e., it is numeric) or if the number is an integer, it appends the number to the digits list. After that, it converts all the numbers in the digits list to integers. Finally, it returns the digits list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, '1', '2', 0], we need to filter out the non-numeric values from the list and convert the remaining numeric values to integers.

The non-numeric values in the input list are 0 and '0'. The numeric values are 6, '1', '2', and 0. After filtering out the non-numeric values, the remaining numeric values are 6, 1, 2, and 0. After converting these values to integers, the output of executing the function f on the input [0, 6, '1', '2', 0] is [6, 1, 2, 0].
<<<Output>>>
[6, 1, 2, 0]
