You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(orig):
    copy = orig
    copy.append(100)
    orig.pop()
    return copy
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([1, 2, 3])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list orig as input. It creates a copy of the list orig and assigns it to the variable copy. Then it appends the number 100 to the copy list. After that, it removes the last element from the orig list. Finally, it returns the copy list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to create a copy of the input list, append 100 to the copy, remove the last element from the input list, and return the copy.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3, 100].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 100]
