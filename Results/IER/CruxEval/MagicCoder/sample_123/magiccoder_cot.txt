You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    for idx, e in enumerate(array):
        if e > elem and array[idx - 1] < elem:
            array.insert(idx, elem)
    return array
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([1, 2, 3, 5, 8], 6)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array and an element as input. It iterates over the array and checks if the current element is greater than the given element and the previous element is less than the given element. If the conditions are met, it inserts the given element at the current index.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 5, 8] and 6, we need to iterate over the array and check the conditions for each element.

In the first iteration, the current element is 1 and the previous element is 0 (as there is no previous element in the array). Since 1 is not greater than 6 and 0 is not less than 6, we do not insert 6.

In the second iteration, the current element is 2 and the previous element is 1. Since 2 is not greater than 6 and 1 is not less than 6, we do not insert 6.

In the third iteration, the current element is 3 and the previous element is 2. Since 3 is not greater than 6 and 2 is not less than 6, we do not insert 6.

In the fourth iteration, the current element is 5 and the previous element is 3. Since 5 is greater than 6 and 3 is less than 6, we insert 6 at the current index.

In the fifth iteration, the current element is 8 and the previous element is 5. Since 8 is not greater than 6 and 5 is not less than 6, we do not insert 6.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3, 5, 8] and 6 is [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 8]
