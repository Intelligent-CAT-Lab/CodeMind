I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    n = int(text.find('8'))
    return 'x0'*n

[Question]
What would be the return value of`f("sa832d83r xd 8g 26a81xdf")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input. The function int(text.find('8')) finds the index of the first occurrence of the character '8' in the string text. The function then returns the string 'x0' repeated n times, where n is the index of the first occurrence of '8' in the string text.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "sa832d83r xd 8g 26a81xdf", we need to find the index of the first occurrence of '8' in the string "sa832d83r xd 8g 26a81xdf".

The index of the first occurrence of '8' in the string "sa832d83r xd 8g 26a81xdf" is 2. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "sa832d83r xd 8g 26a81xdf" is 'x0x0'.
<<<Output>>>
'x0x0'
