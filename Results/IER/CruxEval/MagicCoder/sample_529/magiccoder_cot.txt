You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    prev = array[0]
    newArray = array[:]
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        if prev != array[i]:
            newArray[i] = array[i]
        else:
            del newArray[i]
        prev = array[i]
    return newArray
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([1, 2, 3])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list array as input. It initializes a variable prev with the first element of the array. It then creates a new list newArray which is a copy of the input array.

The function then iterates over the elements of the array starting from the second element. For each element, it checks if it is equal to the previous element. If they are equal, it removes the current element from newArray. If they are not equal, it updates the current element of newArray with the current element of the array.

Finally, it updates the prev variable with the current element of the array and continues with the next iteration.

The function returns the newArray after processing all the elements.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3], we need to iterate over the list and remove the duplicate elements.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2]
