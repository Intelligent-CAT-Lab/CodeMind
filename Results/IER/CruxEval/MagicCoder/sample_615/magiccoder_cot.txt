I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(in_list, num):
    in_list.append(num)
    return in_list.index(max(in_list[:-1]))
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([-1, 12, -6, -2], -1)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list in_list and a number num as input. It first appends num to in_list. Then it returns the index of the maximum number in in_list excluding the last element.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [−1, 12, −6, −2], −1, we need to:
1. Append −1 to the list [−1, 12, −6, −2].
2. Find the maximum number in the list excluding the last element, which is 12.
3. Find the index of 12 in the list, which is 1.

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [−1, 12, −6, −2], −1 is 1.
<<<Output>>>
