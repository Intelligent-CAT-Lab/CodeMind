I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    for i in str(n):
        if not i.isdigit():
            n = -1
            break
    return n

[Question]
What would be the return value of`f("6 ** 2")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>

The function f takes a string n as input. It then converts the string n into a list of characters. It then checks each character in the list. If the character is not a digit, it sets n to -1 and breaks the loop. If all characters are digits, it returns n.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "6 ** 2", we need to convert the string "6 ** 2" into a list of characters. The list of characters is ['6','', '*', '*','', '2']. The function checks each character in the list. Since'' and '*' are not digits, it sets n to -1 and breaks the loop. Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "6 ** 2" is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
