You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(num):
    num.append(num[-1])
    return num
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([-70, 20, 9, 1])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list num as input. It appends the last element of the list to the end of the list.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-70, 20, 9, 1], we need to append the last element of the list to the end of the list.
The last element of the list is 1, so after appending 1 to the end of the list, the list becomes [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-70, 20, 9, 1] is [-70, 20, 9, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[-70, 20, 9, 1, 1]
