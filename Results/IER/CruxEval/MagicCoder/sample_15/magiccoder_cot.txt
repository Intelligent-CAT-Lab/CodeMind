You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, wrong, right):
    new_text = text.replace(wrong, right)
    return new_text.upper()

[Question]
What would be the return value of`f("zn kgd jw lnt", "h", "u")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three parameters: text, wrong, and right. It replaces all occurrences of the wrong character in the text with the right character, and then converts the resulting string to uppercase.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "zn kgd jw lnt", "h", "u", we need to replace all occurrences of "h" in "zn kgd jw lnt" with "u", and then convert the resulting string to uppercase.

The replace function in Python replaces all occurrences of the first argument in the string with the second argument. So, "zn kgd jw lnt".replace("h", "u") would give "zn kgd ju wlnt".

The upper function in Python converts all lowercase characters in a string to uppercase characters and leaves all uppercase characters as they are. So, "zn kgd ju wlnt".upper() would give "ZN KGD JU WLNT".

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "zn kgd jw lnt", "h", "u" is "ZN KGD JU WLNT".
<<<Output>>>
'ZN KGD JU WLNT'
