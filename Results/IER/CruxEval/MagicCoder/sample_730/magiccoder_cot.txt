I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    m = 0
    cnt = 0
    for i in text.split():
        if len(i) > m:
            cnt += 1
            m = len(i)
    return cnt

[Question]
What would be the return value of`f("wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input. It initializes two variables m and cnt to 0. It then splits the input string into words and iterates over each word. For each word, it checks if the length of the word is greater than m. If it is, it increments cnt and updates m with the length of the word. Finally, it returns the value of cnt.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl", we need to count the number of words in the input string that have the maximum length.

The words in the input string are "wys", "silak", "v5", "e4fi", "rotbi", "fwj", "78", "wigf", "t8s", "lcl". The word "wys" has the maximum length (3), so the output of executing the function f on the input "wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl" is 1.
