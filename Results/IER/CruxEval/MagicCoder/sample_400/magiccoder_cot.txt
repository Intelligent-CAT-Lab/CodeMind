You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(multi_string):
    cond_string = map(str.isascii, multi_string.split())
    if True in cond_string:
        return ', '.join(x for x in multi_string.split() if x.isascii())
    return ''
<Code>
[Question]
What would be the return value of`f('I am hungry! eat food.')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string multi_string as input. It splits the string into words and checks if each word is an ASCII character. If any word is an ASCII character, it joins the ASCII words with a comma and space. If no word is an ASCII character, it returns an empty string.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 'I am hungry! eat food.', we need to split the string into words, check if each word is an ASCII character, and join the ASCII words with a comma and space.

The words in the string 'I am hungry! eat food.' are 'I', 'am', 'hungry!', 'eat', 'food.'. The word 'hungry!' is not an ASCII character, so the output of executing the function f on the input 'I am hungry! eat food.' is 'I, eat, food.'.
<<<Output>>>
'I, eat, food.'
