You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
[Question]
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    new = list()
    i = len(lst)-1
    for _ in range(len(lst)):
        if i%2 == 0:
            new.append(-lst[i])
        else:
            new.append(lst[i])
        i -= 1
    return new

[Question]
What would be the return value of`f([1, 7, -1, -3])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input. It creates a new list new and initializes an index i to the last index of lst. It then iterates over the list lst in reverse order, appending the negative of the element at index i if i is even, or the element at index i if i is odd. Finally, it returns the new list.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 7, -1, -3], we need to iterate over the list in reverse order, and for each index i, append the negative of the element at index i if i is even, or the element at index i if i is odd.

For the input [1, 7, -1, -3], the index i starts from 3 (the last index of the list) and goes down to 0.

At index 3, i is odd, so the element at index i is -3. Therefore, the new list new is [-3].

At index 2, i is even, so the element at index i is -1. Therefore, the new list new becomes [-3, -1].

At index 1, i is odd, so the element at index i is 7. Therefore, the new list new becomes [-3, -1, 7].

At index 0, i is even, so the element at index i is 1. Therefore, the new list new becomes [-3, -1, 7, -1].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 7, -1, -3] is [-3, -1, 7, -1].
<<<Output>>>
[-3, -1, 7, -1]
