Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    return text.replace('\n', '\t')
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('apples\n\t\npears\n\t\nbananas')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the string text with all the newline characters replaced by tab characters.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "apples\n\t\npears\n\t\nbananas", we need to replace all the newline characters with tab characters.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "apples\n\t\npears\n\t\nbananas" is "apples\t\tpears\t\tbananas".
<<<Output>>>
'apples\t\tpears\t\tbananas'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[1:3]
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hello")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the substring of s starting at index 1 and ending at index 3.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hello", we need to return the substring of "hello" starting at index 1 and ending at index 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hello" is "el".
<<<Output>>>
'el'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[1:]
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hello")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the substring of s starting at index 1 and ending at the end of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hello", we need to return the substring of "hello" starting at index 1 and ending at the end of the string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hello" is "ello".
<<<Output>>>
