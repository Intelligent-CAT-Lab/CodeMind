Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, value):
    return text.removeprefix(value.lower())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('coscifysu', 'cos')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, text and value.
The function returns the string text with the prefix value removed.
The prefix value is removed from the beginning of the string text.
The prefix value is removed from the beginning of the string text by converting it to lower case.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "coscifysu" and "cos" is "csifysu".
<<<Output>>>
'csifysu'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, value):
    return text.removesuffix(value.lower())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('coscifysu', 'ify')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, text and value.
The function returns the string text with the suffix value removed.
The suffix value is removed from the end of the string text.
The suffix value is removed from the end of the string text by converting it to lower case.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "coscifysu" and "ify" is "coscis".
<<<Output>>>
'coscis'
