Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, sep, num):
    return '___'.join(text.rsplit(sep, num))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('aa+++bb', '+', 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three inputs: text, sep, and num.
The function returns the string '___'.join(text.rsplit(sep, num)).
The function f calls the method rsplit on the string text.
The method rsplit takes two inputs: sep and num.
