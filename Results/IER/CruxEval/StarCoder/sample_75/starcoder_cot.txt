Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    ind = array.index(elem)
    return ind * 2 + array[-ind - 1] * 3
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array and an element as input and returns the product of the index of the element in the array and the product of the last element in the array and the second last element in the array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2), we need to find the index of 2 in the array [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2].
The index of 2 in the array [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2] is 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 2, 1, -8, 2], 2) is 1 * 2 + 2 * 3 = 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
