Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(val, text):
    indices = [index for index in range(len(text)) if text[index] == val]
    if len(indices) == 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return indices[0]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('o', 'fnmart')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, val and text.
The function first creates a list of indices, which is a list of all the indices in the text where the value of the text at that index is equal to val.
The function then checks if the length of the list of indices is equal to 0.
If the length of the list of indices is equal to 0, the function returns -1.
Otherwise, the function returns the first element of the list of indices.
<<<Output>>>
