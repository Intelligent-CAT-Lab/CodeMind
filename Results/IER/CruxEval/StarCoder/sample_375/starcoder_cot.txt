Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b):
    if b in a:
        return b.join(a.partition(a[a.index(b) + 1]))
    else:
        return a
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('sierizam', 'iz')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, a and b.
The function checks if b is in a.
If b is in a, then the function returns the concatenation of the string b and the string that results from partitioning a around the first occurrence of b.
If b is not in a, then the function returns a.
<<<Output>>>
'sierizam'
