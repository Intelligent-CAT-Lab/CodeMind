Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    nums = list(filter(str.isnumeric, text))
    assert len(nums) > 0
    return ''.join(nums)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('-123   \t+314')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the concatenation of the string of the numbers in text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "-123   \t+314", we need to filter the string "-123   \t+314" to get the string "123314".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "-123   \t+314" is "123314".
<<<Output>>>
'123314'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    nums = list(filter(str.isnumeric, text))
    assert len(nums) > 0
    return sum(map(int, nums))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('-123   \t+314')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the sum of the numbers in text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "-123   \t+314", we need to filter the string "-123   \t+314" to get the string "123314".
Then we need to convert the string "123314" to a list of integers.
Finally, we need to sum the integers in the list.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "-123   \t+314" is 457.
<<<Output>>>
457
