Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(input_string, spaces):
    return input_string.expandtabs(spaces)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(r'a\tb', 4)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: input_string and spaces.
The input_string is a string with a tab character in it.
The spaces is an integer.
The function returns the input_string with the tab characters replaced by spaces.
The input_string is r'a\tb', which is a string with a tab character in it.
The spaces is 4, which is an integer.
The function returns the input_string with the tab characters replaced by spaces.
<<<Output>>>
'a    b'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s.replace("a", "b")
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("cat")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the string s with all the "a" characters replaced by "b" characters.
The input to the function is "cat".
The function returns the string "cbt".
<<<Output>>>
'cbt'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s.replace("a", "b").replace("b", "c")
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("cat")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the string s with all the "a" characters replaced by "b" characters, and then all the "b" characters replaced by "c" characters.
The input to the function is "cat".
The function returns the string "cbt".
<<<Output>>>
