Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, digit):
    #different than previous? Just count instances digit
    count = text.count(digit)
    return int(digit) * count
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('7Ljnw4Lj', '7')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, text and digit.
The function first counts the number of times the digit appears in the text.
The function then returns the integer value of the digit multiplied by the number of times the digit appears in the text.
The function f is called with the inputs '7Ljnw4Lj' and '7'.
The function first counts the number of times the digit '7' appears in the text '7Ljnw4Lj'.
The function then returns the integer value of the digit '7' multiplied by the number of times the digit '7' appears in the text '7Ljnw4Lj'.
The function f is called with the inputs '7Ljnw4Lj' and '7'.
