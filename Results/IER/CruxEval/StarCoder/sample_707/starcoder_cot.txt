Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, position):
    length = len(text)
    index = position % (length + 1)
    if position < 0 or index < 0:
        index = -1
    new_text = list(text)
    new_text.pop(index)
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('undbs l', 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a string text and an integer position.
The function first calculates the length of the string text.
The function then calculates the index of the string text.
The index is calculated by taking the modulus of the position and the length of the string text plus 1.
The modulus is the remainder of the division of the position by the length of the string text plus 1.
The function then checks if the position is less than 0 or the index is less than 0.
If either of these conditions is true, the function sets the index to -1.
The function then creates a new list of the characters in the string text.
The function then removes the character at the index from the list.
The function then returns the string formed by concatenating the characters in the list.
<<<Output>>>
'undbs l'
