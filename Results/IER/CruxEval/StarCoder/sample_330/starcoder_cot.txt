Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    ans = []
    for char in text:
        if char.isdigit():
            ans.append(char)
        else:
            ans.append(' ')
    return ''.join(ans)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('m4n2o')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string.
The string is constructed by iterating through the characters in text.
If the character is a digit, then it is appended to the list ans.
Otherwise, a space is appended to the list ans.
The list ans is then converted to a string by joining the characters in the list with the empty string.
<<<Output>>>
'4 2 0'
