Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(seq, v):
    a = []
    for i in seq:
        if i.endswith(v):
            a.append(i*2)
    return a
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([ 'oH', 'ee','mb', 'deft', 'n', 'zz', 'f', 'abA' ], 'zz')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list seq and a string v as input.
The function creates a new list a.
The function iterates through the list seq.
For each element in seq, if the element ends with the string v, then the element is appended to the list a.
The function returns the list a.
The list a contains the elements of seq that end with the string v.
The elements of seq that end with the string v are doubled.
The list a contains the doubled elements of seq that end with the string v.
The function returns the list a.
<<<Output>>>
['zz', 'zz', 'zz']
