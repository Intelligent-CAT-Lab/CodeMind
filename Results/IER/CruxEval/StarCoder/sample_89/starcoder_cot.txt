Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(char):
    if char not in 'aeiouAEIOU':
        return None
    if char in 'AEIOU':
        return char.lower()
    return char.upper()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('o')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string char as input and returns the corresponding output based on the following conditions:
- If char is not in 'aeiouAEIOU', return None
- If char is in 'AEIOU', return char in lower case
- If char is in 'aeiou', return char in upper case

The function f('o') will return 'o' because it is in 'aeiou'.
<<<Output>>>
'o'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    if len(s) == 0:
        return 0
    return 1 + f(s[1:])
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the number of characters in s plus 1.
The function f("hi") will return 3 because the length of "hi" is 2 and 1 is added to it.
<<<Output>>>
3

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    if len(s) == 0:

    return 1 + f(s[:-1])
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the number of characters in s plus 1.
The function f("hi") will return 2 because the length of "hi" is 2 and 1 is added to it.
