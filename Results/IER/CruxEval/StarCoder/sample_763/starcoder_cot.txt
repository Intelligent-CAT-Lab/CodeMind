Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(values, text, markers):
    return text.rstrip(values).rstrip(markers)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('2Pn', 'yCxpg2C2Pny2', '')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three inputs: values, text, and markers.
The function returns the string text with the rightmost characters removed from the string values and the string markers.
The function f is called with the inputs '2Pn', 'yCxpg2C2Pny2', and ''.
The function f first removes the rightmost characters from the string '2Pn' and the string ''.
The function f then removes the rightmost characters from the string 'yCxpg2C2Pny2' and the string ''.
The function f returns the string 'yCxpg2C2Pny2'.
<<<Output>>>
'yCxpg2C2Pny2'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s.replace('a', 'b')
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f('abba')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the string s with all the characters 'a' replaced by the characters 'b'.
The function f is called with the input 'abba'.
The function f replaces all the characters 'a' in the string 'abba' with the characters 'b'.
The function f returns the string 'bbba'.
<<<Output>>>
'bbba'
