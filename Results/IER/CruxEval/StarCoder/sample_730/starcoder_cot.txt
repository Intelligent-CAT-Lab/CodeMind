Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    m = 0
    cnt = 0
    for i in text.split():
        if len(i) > m:
            cnt += 1
            m = len(i)
    return cnt
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the number of words in text that have the maximum length.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl", we need to split the input into words.
Then we need to find the length of each word and find the maximum length.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "wys silak v5 e4fi rotbi fwj 78 wigf t8s lcl" is 3.
<<<Output>>>
