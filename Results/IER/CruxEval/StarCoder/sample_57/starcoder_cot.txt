Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    text = text.upper()
    count_upper = 0
    for char in text:
        if char.isupper():
            count_upper += 1
        else:
            return 'no'
    return count_upper // 2
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ax')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the number of upper case letters in text divided by 2.
The function first converts text to upper case letters.
Then the function counts the number of upper case letters in text.
Finally, the function returns the number of upper case letters in text divided by 2.
<<<Output>>>
