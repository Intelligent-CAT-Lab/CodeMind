Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    if not text.istitle():
        return text.title()
    return text.lower()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("PermissioN is GRANTed")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the string text in lowercase if the string text is in uppercase.
The string "PermissioN is GRANTed" is in uppercase.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "PermissioN is GRANTed" is "permision is granted".
<<<Output>>>
'permision is granted'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    if text.endswith("ed"):
        return text + "ly"
    return text + "ing"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("walk")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the string text in lowercase if the string text is in uppercase.
The string "walk" does not end with "ed".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "walk" is "walking".
<<<Output>>>
'walking'
