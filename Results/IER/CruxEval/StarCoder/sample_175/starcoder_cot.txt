Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, amount):
    lines = s.splitlines()
    w = max(map(lambda l: l.rfind(' '), lines))
    ls = [[l, (w + 1) * amount - l.rfind(' ')] for l in lines]
    for i, line in enumerate(ls):
        ls[i][0] = line[0] +'' * line[1]
    return '\n'.join(map(lambda l: l[0], ls))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('\n', 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a string s and an integer amount.
The function splits s into a list of lines.
The function computes the maximum of the list of integers generated by applying the function lambda l: l.rfind(' ') to each line in the list of lines.
The function computes a list of lists of two elements.
The first element of each list is a line from the list of lines.
The second element of each list is the product of the maximum and the amount.
