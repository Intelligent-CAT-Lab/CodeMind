Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    ls = list(text)
    for i in range(0, len(ls)):
        if ls[i]!='+':
            ls.insert(i, '+')
            ls.insert(i, '*')
            break
    return '+'.join(ls)

What would be the return value of `f('nzoh')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the string that is the result of inserting the characters '+' and '*' in the appropriate places in text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "nzoh", we need to insert the characters '+' and '*' in the appropriate places in "nzoh".
The first time that the character 'z' is encountered in the string "nzoh", we insert the characters '+' and '*' before the 'z'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "nzoh" is "+n+z+o+h".
<<<Output>>>
'+n+z+o+h'

What would be the return value of `f('abc')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the string that is the concatenation of the first three characters of s.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "abc", we need to concatenate the first three characters of "abc".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "abc" is "abc".
<<<Output>>>
