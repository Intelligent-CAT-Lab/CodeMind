Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, i_num, elem):
    array.insert(i_num, elem)
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([ -4,   1,  0], 1, 4)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array, an index i_num, and an element elem as input.
The function f inserts the element elem into the array at the index i_num.
The function f returns the array.
The return value of the function f is the array with the element elem inserted at the index i_num.
<<<Output>>>
[ -4, 4, 1, 0]
