Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(strand, zmnc):
    poz = strand.find(zmnc)
    while poz!= -1:
        strand = strand[poz + 1:]
        poz = strand.find(zmnc)
    return strand.rfind(zmnc)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('', 'abc')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, strand and zmnc.
The function f returns the last position of zmnc in strand.
The function f returns -1 if zmnc is not in strand.
The function f returns the last position of zmnc in strand.
<<<Output>>>
-1

Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the first character of s.
The function f returns the first character of s.
<<<Output>>>
