Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    length = len(text)
    index = 0
    while index < length and text[index].isspace():
        index += 1
    return text[index:index+5]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('-----\t\n\tth\n-----')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the first 5 characters of text that are not whitespace.
The input string '-----\t\n\tth\n-----' has 10 characters.
The first 5 characters of the input string are '-----'.
The first 5 characters of the input string that are not whitespace are '-----'.
The function f returns '-----'.
<<<Output>>>
'-----'
