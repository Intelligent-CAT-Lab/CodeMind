Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(txt):
    return txt.format(*('0'*20,))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("5123807309875480094949830")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string txt as input and returns the string txt.format(*('0'*20,)).
The string txt.format(*('0'*20,)) is the string "5123807309875480094949830" with 20 '0' characters in the place of the {}.
The return value of the function f is the string "5123807309875480094949830" with 20 '0' characters in the place of the {}.
<<<Output>>>
'5123807309875480094949830'
