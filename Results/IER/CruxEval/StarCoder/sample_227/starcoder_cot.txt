Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    text = text.lower()
    head, tail = text[0], text[1:]
    return head.upper() + tail
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Manolo')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the concatenation of the first letter of text in upper case and the rest of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Manolo", we need to convert the string to lower case, then extract the first letter of the string and convert it to upper case.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "Manolo" is "MaNOLo".
<<<Output>>>
'MaNOLo'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    return x + 1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f(3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer x as input and returns the sum of x and 1.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 3, we need to add 1 to 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 3 is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    return x + 1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f(3.0)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a float x as input and returns the sum of x and 1.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input 3.0, we need to add 1 to 3.0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 3.0 is 4.0.
<<<Output>>>
4.0
