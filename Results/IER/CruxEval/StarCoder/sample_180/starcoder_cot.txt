Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums):
    a = -1
    b = nums[1:]
    while a <= b[0]:
        nums.remove(b[0])
        a = 0
        b = b[1:]
    return nums

What would be the return value of `f([-1, 5, 3, -2, -6, 8, 8])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers.
The list of numbers is [-1, 5, 3, -2, -6, 8, 8].
The list of numbers is assigned to the variable nums.
The variable a is assigned the value -1.
The variable b is assigned the value nums[1:].
The variable a is assigned the value 0.
The variable b is assigned the value b[1:].
The list of numbers is assigned to the variable nums.
The list of numbers is returned.
<<<Output>>>
[-1, 3, -2, -6, 8]

The function f takes a string s as input and returns the first character of the string s.
The string s is "hello".
The first character of the string s is returned.
