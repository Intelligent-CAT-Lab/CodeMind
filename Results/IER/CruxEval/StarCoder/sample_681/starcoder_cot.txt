Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, ind, elem):
    array.insert(-5 if ind < 0 else len(array) if ind > len(array) else ind + 1, elem)
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 3], 2, 7)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array, an index, and an element as input.
The function f inserts the element into the array at the specified index.
The function f returns the array.
The function f inserts the element 7 into the array at the index 2.
The function f returns the array.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 8, 2, 7, 0, 3]

The function f takes an array and an element as input.
The function f inserts the element at the beginning of the array.
The function f returns the array.
The function f inserts the element 7 at the beginning of the array.
