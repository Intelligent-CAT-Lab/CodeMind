Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(d, k):
    new_d = {}
    for key, val in d.items():
        if key < k:
            new_d[key] = val
    return new_d
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 3}, 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d and a number k as input.
The function creates a new dictionary new_d.
The function iterates through the keys and values of d.
If the key is less than k, then the key and value are added to new_d.
The function returns new_d.

<<<Output>>>
{1: 2, 2: 4}
