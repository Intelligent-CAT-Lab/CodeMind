Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    new_text = [c if c.isdigit() else '*' for c in text]
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('5f83u23saa')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string new_text.
The new_text is a list of characters.
The list is created by iterating through the characters in text.
For each character c in text, if c is a digit, then the character c is added to the list.
Otherwise, the character '*' is added to the list.
The list is then converted to a string by joining the characters in the list.
The return value of the function f is the string new_text.
<<<Output>>>
'5*8*3*2*3*s*a*a'
