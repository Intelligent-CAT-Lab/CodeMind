Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    text_arr = []
    for j in range(len(text)):
        text_arr.append(text[j:])
    return text_arr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('123')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a list of strings.
The list of strings is generated by iterating through the characters of the input string.
For each character in the input string, the function appends the substring of the input string that starts at the current character and continues to the end of the string.
The list of strings is returned.
<<<Output>>>
['123', '23', '3']

def f(text):
    text_arr = []
    for j in range(len(text)):
        text_arr.append(text[:j])
    return text_arr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('123')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string text as input and returns a list of strings.
The list of strings is generated by iterating through the characters of the input string.
For each character in the input string, the function appends the substring of the input string that starts at the beginning of the string and continues to the current character.
The list of strings is returned.
<<<Output>>>
['', '1', '12', '123']
