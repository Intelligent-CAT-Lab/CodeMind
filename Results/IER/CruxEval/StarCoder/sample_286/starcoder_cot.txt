Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, x, i):
    if i < -len(array) or i > len(array) - 1:
        return 'no'
    temp = array[i]
    array[i] = x
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], 11, 4)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array, x, and i as input.
The function checks if i is less than -len(array) or i is greater than len(array) - 1.
If i is less than -len(array), the function returns 'no'.
If i is greater than len(array) - 1, the function returns 'no'.
If i is not less than -len(array) and i is not greater than len(array) - 1, the function assigns the value of array[i] to temp.
The function then assigns x to array[i].
The function returns array.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11]
