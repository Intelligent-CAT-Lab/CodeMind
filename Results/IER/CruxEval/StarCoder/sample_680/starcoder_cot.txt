Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    letters = ''
    for i in range(len(text)):
        if text[i].isalnum():
            letters += text[i]
    return letters
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("we@32r71g72ug94=(823658*!@324")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string letters.
The string letters is initialized to the empty string.
The for loop iterates over the characters in the string text.
The if statement checks if the character is alphanumeric.
If the character is alphanumeric, the character is added to the string letters.
The return statement returns the string letters.
<<<Output>>>
'we32r71g72ug94'
