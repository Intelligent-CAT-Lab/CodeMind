Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, prefix):
    return text[len(prefix):]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('123x John z', 'z')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, text and prefix.
The function returns the substring of text starting from the index of the length of prefix.
The index of the length of prefix is 1.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '123x John z', 'z' is'John z'.
<<<Output>>>
' John z'

What would be the return value of `f('123x John z', 'John')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, text and prefix.
The function returns the substring of text starting from the index of the length of prefix.
The index of the length of prefix is 5.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '123x John z', 'John' is'z'.
<<<Output>>>

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, text and prefix.
The function returns the substring of text starting from the index of the length of prefix.
The index of the length of prefix is 0.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '123x John z', '123x' is'John z'.
