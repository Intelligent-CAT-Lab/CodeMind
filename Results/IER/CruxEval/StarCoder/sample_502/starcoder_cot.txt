Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(name):
    return '*'.join(name.split(' '))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Fred Smith')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string name as input and returns the concatenation of the string '*' with the string''.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "Fred Smith", we need to split the string "Fred Smith" into a list of strings.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "Fred Smith" is "*Fred* *Smith*".
<<<Output>>>
'*Fred* *Smith*'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[1:3]
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hello")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the substring of s starting at index 1 and ending at index 3.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hello", we need to get the substring of "hello" starting at index 1 and ending at index 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hello" is "el".
<<<Output>>>
'el'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[1:]
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hello")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the substring of s starting at index 1 and ending at the end of the string.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hello", we need to get the substring of "hello" starting at index 1 and ending at the end of the string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hello" is "ello".
<<<Output>>>
'ello'
