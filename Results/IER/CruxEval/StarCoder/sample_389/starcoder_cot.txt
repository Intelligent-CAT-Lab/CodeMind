Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(total, arg):
    if type(arg) is list:
        for e in arg:
            total.extend(e)
    else:
        total.extend(arg)
    return total
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3], 'nammo')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, total and arg.
The total argument is a list, and the arg argument is a string.
The if statement checks if the type of arg is a list.
If the type of arg is a list, then the for loop iterates over the elements of arg and appends each element to the list total.
If the type of arg is not a list, then the function appends arg to the list total.
The return value of the function is the list total.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 'n', 'a','m','m', 'o']
