Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    new = list()
    i = len(lst)-1
    for _ in range(len(lst)):
        if i%2 == 0:
            new.append(-lst[i])
        else:
            new.append(lst[i])
        i -= 1
    return new
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 7, -1, -3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and returns a new list new.
The new list new is initialized to be an empty list.
The variable i is initialized to be the length of lst minus 1.
The for loop iterates through the range of the length of lst.
The if statement checks if i is evenly divisible by 2.
If i is evenly divisible by 2, then the value of lst[i] is appended to new with a negative sign.
Otherwise, the value of lst[i] is appended to new without a negative sign.
The value of i is decremented by 1.
The return value of the function f on the input [1, 7, -1, -3] is [-1, 7, 1, -3].
<<<Output>>>
[-1, 7, 1, -3]
