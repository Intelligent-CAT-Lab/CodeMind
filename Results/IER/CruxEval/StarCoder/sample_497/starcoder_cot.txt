Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    b = list(str(n))
    for i in range(2,len(b)): b[i] += '+'
    return b
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(44)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a number n as input and returns a list of strings.
The list of strings is generated by converting the number n to a string and then iterating through the string.
For each character in the string, the function adds the character '+' to the string.
The list of strings is returned.
The return value of the function f(44) is ['4', '+', '4'].
<<<Output>>>
['4', '+', '4']
