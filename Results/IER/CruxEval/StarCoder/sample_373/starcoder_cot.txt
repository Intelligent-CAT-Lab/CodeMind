Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(orig):
    copy = orig
    copy.append(100)
    orig.pop()
    return copy
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list as input and returns a copy of the list.
The copy is created by making a shallow copy of the original list.
The shallow copy is created by making a new list object and copying the contents of the original list into the new list.
The new list object is created by calling the list constructor.
The contents of the original list are copied into the new list by using the list's append method.
The original list is then modified by using the list's pop method.
The return value of the function is the new list object.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 100]

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
The string s is modified by concatenating "a" to the end of s.
The return value of the function is the modified string s.
<<<Output>>>
