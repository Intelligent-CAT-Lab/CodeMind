Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    streak = ''
    for c in str(n):
        streak += c.ljust(int(c) * 2)
    return streak
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer n as input and returns a string streak.
The variable streak is initialized to the empty string.
The for loop iterates over the characters in the string representation of n.
For each character c in the string representation of n, the code appends c to streak.
The code then appends c.ljust(int(c) * 2) to streak.
The function f returns the value of streak.

<<<Output>>>
'11'

What would be the return value of `f(10)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
