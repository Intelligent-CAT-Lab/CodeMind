Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b):
    if a < b:
        return (b, a)
    return (a, b)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ml','mv')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input and returns a tuple of two strings.
The first string in the tuple is the larger of the two input strings.
The second string in the tuple is the smaller of the two input strings.
The first string in the tuple is the larger of the two input strings.
The second string in the tuple is the smaller of the two input strings.
<<<Output>>>
('ml','mv')
