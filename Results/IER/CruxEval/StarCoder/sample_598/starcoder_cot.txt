Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, n):
    length = len(text)
    return text[length*(n%4):length ]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('abc', 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, a string text and an integer n.
The function returns the substring of text that starts at the length of text times n mod 4 and ends at the length of text.
The length of text is 3.
The length of text times n mod 4 is 3.
The length of text is 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "abc", 1 is "bc".
<<<Output>>>
'bc'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, n):
    length = len(text)
    return text[length*(n%4):length ]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('abc', 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, a string text and an integer n.
The function returns the substring of text that starts at the length of text times n mod 4 and ends at the length of text.
The length of text is 3.
The length of text times n mod 4 is 6.
The length of text is 3.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "abc", 2 is "".
<<<Output>>>
