Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    for c in text:
        if not c.isnumeric():
            return False
    return bool(text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('99')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns False if any of the characters in text is not a number.
The function f returns True if text is not empty.
The function f returns False if text is empty.
The function f returns False if any of the characters in text is not a number.
The function f returns False if text is empty.
<<<Output>>>
False
