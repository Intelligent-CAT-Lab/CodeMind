Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(d, l):
	new_d = {}

	for k in l:
		if d.get(k) is not None:
			new_d[k] = d[k]

	return new_d.copy()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({"lorem ipsum" : 12, "dolor" : 23}, ["lorem ipsum", "dolor"])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arguments, a dictionary d and a list l.
The function creates a new dictionary new_d.
The function iterates through the keys of the dictionary d.
If the key is in the list l, then the value of the key in the new dictionary is the value of the key in the original dictionary.
The function returns the copy of the new dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{'lorem ipsum': 12, 'dolor': 23}
