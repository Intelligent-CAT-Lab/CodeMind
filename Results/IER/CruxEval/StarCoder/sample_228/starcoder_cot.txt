Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, splitter):
    return splitter.join(text.lower().split())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('LlTHH sAfLAPkPhtsWP', '#')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: text and splitter.
The function first converts the text to lower case.
The function then splits the text into a list of words.
The function then joins the list of words using the splitter.
The output of the function f on the input 'LlTHH sAfLAPkPhtsWP' and '#' is 'llthh#saflapkphtswp'.
<<<Output>>>
'llthh#saflapkphtswp'
