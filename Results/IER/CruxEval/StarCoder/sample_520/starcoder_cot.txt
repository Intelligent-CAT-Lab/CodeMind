Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(album_sales):
    while len(album_sales)!= 1:
        album_sales.append(album_sales.pop(0))
    return album_sales[0]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([6])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns the last number in the list.
The while loop will run until the length of the list is 1.
The first time the loop runs, the list will be [6].
The list will be popped from the front and appended to the end.
The list will be [6, 6].
The list will be popped from the front and appended to the end.
The list will be [6, 6, 6].
The list will be popped from the front and appended to the end.
The list will be [6, 6, 6, 6].
The list will be popped from the front and appended to the end.
The list will be [6, 6, 6, 6, 6].
The list will be popped from the front and appended to the end.
The list will be [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6].
The list will be popped from the front and appended to the end.
The list will be [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6].
The list will be popped from the front and appended to the end.
The list will be [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6].
The list will be popped from the front and appended to the end.
