Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(doc):
    for x in doc:
        if x.isalpha():
            return x.capitalize()
    return '-'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('raruwa')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string doc as input and returns the first alphabetic character in doc.
The first alphabetic character in 'raruwa' is 'r'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'raruwa' is 'r'.
<<<Output>>>
'r'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[0]
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f('abc')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the first character in s.
The first character in 'abc' is 'a'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'abc' is 'a'.
<<<Output>>>
'a'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[1]
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f('abc')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the second character in s.
The second character in 'abc' is 'b'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'abc' is 'b'.
<<<Output>>>
'b'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[2]
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f('abc')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the third character in s.
The third character in 'abc' is 'c'.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'abc' is 'c'.
<<<Output>>>
'c'
