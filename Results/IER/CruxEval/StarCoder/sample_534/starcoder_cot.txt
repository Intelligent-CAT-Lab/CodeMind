Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(sequence, value):
    i = max(sequence.index(value) - len(sequence) // 3, 0)
    result = ''
    for j, v in enumerate(sequence[i:]):
        if v == '+':
            result += value
        else:
            result += sequence[i + j]
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('hosu', 'o')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
