Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(d, get_ary):
    result = []
    for key in get_ary:
        result.append(d.get(key))
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({3: "swims like a bull"}, [3, 2, 'c', True, 5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d and a list get_ary as input.
The function f creates a list result.
The function f iterates through the list get_ary and for each element in the list, the function f appends the value of the dictionary d for the key to the list result.
The function f returns the list result.
The return value of the function f is the list [None,'swims like a bull', None, None, None].
<<<Output>>>
[None,'swims like a bull', None, None, None]
