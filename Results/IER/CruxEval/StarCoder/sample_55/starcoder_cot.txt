Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    array_2 = []
    for i in array:
        if i>0:
            array_2 += [i]
    array_2.sort(reverse=True)
    return array_2
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([4, 8, 17, 89, 43, 14])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns an array.
The array_2 is an empty array.
The for loop iterates through the array and adds the elements of the array that are greater than 0 to the array_2.
The array_2 is sorted in descending order.
The return value of the function is the array_2.
<<<Output>>>
[89, 43, 17, 14, 8, 4]
