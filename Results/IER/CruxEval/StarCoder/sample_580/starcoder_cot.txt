Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    new_text = text
    a = []
    while char in new_text:
        a.append(new_text.index(char))
        new_text = new_text.replace(char,"",1)
    return a
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('rvr', 'r')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, text and char.
The function creates a new variable new_text and assigns it the value of text.
The function creates a new list a and assigns it the value of an empty list.
The function loops through the while loop as long as char is in new_text.
Inside the while loop, the function appends the index of char to the list a.
The function replaces char in new_text with an empty string.
The function returns the list a.
<<<Output>>>
[2, 3]
