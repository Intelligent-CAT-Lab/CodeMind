Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, space_symbol, size):
    spaces = ''.join(space_symbol for i in range(size-len(text)))
    return text + spaces
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('w', '))', 7)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three inputs: text, space_symbol, and size.
The function returns the concatenation of text and spaces.
The function first creates a string spaces by concatenating space_symbol a number of times equal to size minus the length of text.
The function then returns the concatenation of text and spaces.
<<<Output>>>
'w     '

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[0]
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hello")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the first character of s.
The first character of "hello" is "h".
<<<Output>>>
'h'

</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hello")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the second character of s.
The second character of "hello" is "e".
<<<Output>>>
'e'

</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hello")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the third character of s.
The third character of "hello" is "l".
<<<Output>>>
'l'
