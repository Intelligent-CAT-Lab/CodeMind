Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, index):
    if index < 0:
        index = len(array) + index
    return array[index]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1], 0)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array and an index as input.
The index is less than 0, so the function will add the length of the array to the index.
The function will then return the value of the array at the index.
The return value of the function is 1.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>

    if index < 0:
        index = len(array) + index
    return array[index]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3], 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array and an index as input.
The index is less than 0, so the function will add the length of the array to the index.
The function will then return the value of the array at the index.
The return value of the function is 2.

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3], -1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array and an index as input.
The index is less than 0, so the function will add the length of the array to the index.
The function will then return the value of the array at the index.
The return value of the function is 3.
