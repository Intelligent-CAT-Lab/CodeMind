Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, limit, char):
    if limit < len(text):
        return text[0:limit]
    return text.ljust(limit, char)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('tqzym', 5, 'c')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three inputs: text, limit, and char.
The function first checks if limit is less than the length of text.
If limit is less than the length of text, then the function returns the first limit characters of text.
If limit is not less than the length of text, then the function returns text left justified with char.
<<<Output>>>
'tqzym'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    if x > 0:
        return x
    else:
        return -x
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f(10)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes one input: x.
The function first checks if x is greater than 0.
If x is greater than 0, then the function returns x.
If x is not greater than 0, then the function returns -x.
<<<Output>>>
10

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    if x > 0:
        return x
    elif x == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return -x
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f(10)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes one input: x.
The function first checks if x is greater than 0.
If x is greater than 0, then the function returns x.
If x is not greater than 0, then the function checks if x is equal to 0.
If x is equal to 0, then the function returns 0.
If x is not equal to 0, then the function returns -x.
<<<Output>>>
