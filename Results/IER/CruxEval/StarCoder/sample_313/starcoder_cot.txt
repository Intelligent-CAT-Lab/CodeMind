Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, l):
    return s.ljust(l, '=').rpartition('=')[0]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('urecord', 8)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, s and l.
The input s is a string.
The input l is an integer.
The function returns the first part of the string s that is l characters long.
The function returns the first part of the string s that is l characters long.
The function returns the first part of the string s that is l characters long.
The function returns the first part of the string s that is l characters long.
<<<Output>>>
'urecord'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s.replace('a', 'b')
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f('abba')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input.
The function returns the string s with all the occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b'.
<<<Output>>>
'bb'
