Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(num):
    if 0 < num < 1000 and num!= 6174:
        return 'Half Life'
    return 'Not found'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(6173)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a number num as input and returns the string 'Half Life' if the following conditions are met:
0 < num < 1000
num!= 6174
Otherwise, the function returns the string 'Not found'.

<<<Output>>>
'Half Life'

    else:
        return 'Not found'
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f('hi')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the string 'Hello' if the following conditions are met:
s == 'hi'
Otherwise, the function returns the string 'Goodbye' if the following conditions are met:
s == 'bye'
Otherwise, the function returns the string 'Not found'.

<<<Output>>>
