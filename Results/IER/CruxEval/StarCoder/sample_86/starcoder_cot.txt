Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(instagram, imgur, wins):
    photos = [instagram, imgur]
    if instagram == imgur:
        return wins
    if wins == 1:
        return photos.pop()
    else:
        photos.reverse()
        return photos.pop()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['sdfs', 'drcr', '2e'], ['sdfs', 'dr2c', 'QWERTY'], 0)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three inputs: instagram, imgur, and wins.
The first two inputs are lists of strings.
The third input is an integer.
The function f returns the value of the following expression:

```
if instagram == imgur:
    return wins
if wins == 1:
    return photos.pop()
else:
    photos.reverse()
    return photos.pop()
```

The first if statement is true, so the function returns the value of the second expression, which is the value of the third input, wins.
The second if statement is false, so the function returns the value of the fourth expression, which is the value of the second input, imgur.
The third if statement is false, so the function returns the value of the fifth expression, which is the value of the first input, instagram.

<<<Output>>>
'sdfs'
