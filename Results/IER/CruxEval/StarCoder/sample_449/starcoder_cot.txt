Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    n = len(x)
    i = 0
    while i < n and x[i].isdigit():
        i += 1
    return i == n
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('1')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string x as input and returns True if x is a string of digits, and False otherwise.
The function f first computes the length of x, which is 1.
The function f then initializes an integer i to 0.
The function f then enters a while loop.
The function f checks if i is less than n and if the i-th element of x is a digit.
The function f then increments i by 1.
The function f then checks if i is equal to n.
The function f then returns the value of i == n, which is True.
<<<Output>>>
True

What would be the return value of `f('123')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The function f takes a string x as input and returns True if x is a string of digits, and False otherwise.
The function f first computes the length of x, which is 3.
The function f then initializes an integer i to 0.
The function f then enters a while loop.
The function f checks if i is less than n and if the i-th element of x is a digit.
The function f then increments i by 1.
