Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(d):
    i = iter(d.items())
    return next(i), next(i)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'a': 123, 'b': 456, 'c': 789})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d as input and returns the first two key-value pairs in the dictionary.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 123, 'b': 456, 'c': 789}, we need to iterate through the dictionary.
The first key-value pair in the dictionary is 'a': 123.
The second key-value pair in the dictionary is 'b': 456.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input {'a': 123, 'b': 456, 'c': 789} is ('a', 123), ('b', 456).
<<<Output>>>
('a', 123), ('b', 456)
