Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, search_string):
    indexes = []
    while search_string in text:
        indexes.append(text.rindex(search_string))
        text = text[:text.rindex(search_string)]
    return indexes
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('ONBPICJOHRHDJOSNCPNJ9ONTHBQCJ', 'J')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, text and search_string.
The function creates an empty list called indexes.
The function loops through the text, searching for the search_string.
If the search_string is found, the function appends the index of the search_string to the indexes list.
The function then removes the search_string from the text.
The function returns the indexes list.
