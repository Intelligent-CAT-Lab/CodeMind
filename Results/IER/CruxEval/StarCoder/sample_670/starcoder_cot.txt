Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a, b):
    d = dict(zip(a, b))
    a.sort(key=d.get, reverse=True)
    return [d.pop(x) for x in a]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['12','ab'], [2,2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two lists as input, a and b.
The function creates a dictionary d from the two lists.
The function sorts the list a based on the values of the dictionary d.
The function returns a list of the values of the dictionary d in the order of the list a.
<<<Output>>>
[2, 2]
