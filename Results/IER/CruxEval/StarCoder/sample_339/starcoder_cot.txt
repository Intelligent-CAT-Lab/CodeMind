Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    elem = str(elem)
    d = 0
    for i in array:
        if str(i) == elem:
            d += 1
    return d
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2], 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array and an element as input and returns the number of times the element appears in the array.
The function first converts the element to a string.
The function then initializes a variable d to 0.
The function then loops through the array and checks if the string version of the element is equal to the string version of the current element in the array.
If the string versions are equal, then d is incremented by 1.
The function returns the value of d.
<<<Output>>>
