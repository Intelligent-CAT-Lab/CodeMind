Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, use):
    return text.replace(use, '')
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday.', 'a')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, text and use.
The function replaces the use with an empty string.
The output of the function is the string 'Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday.' with the 'a' replaced by an empty string.
<<<Output>>>
'Chris requires ride to the airport on Friday.'
