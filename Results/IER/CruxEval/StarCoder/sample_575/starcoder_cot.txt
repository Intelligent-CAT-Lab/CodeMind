Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, val):
    new_list = []
    [new_list.extend([i] * val) for i in nums]
    return sum(new_list)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([10, 4], 3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: a list of numbers nums and a number val.
The function creates a new list new_list.
The function loops through the list nums and appends the number i to new_list val times.
The function returns the sum of the elements in new_list.

<<<Output>>>
33
