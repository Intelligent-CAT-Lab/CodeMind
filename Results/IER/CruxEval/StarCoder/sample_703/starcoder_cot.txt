Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    count = text.count(char*2)
    return text[count:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('vzzv2sg', 'z')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, text and char.
The function first counts the number of occurrences of char*2 in text.
The function then returns the text starting from the count.
The function returns 'v2sg' because 'vzzv2sg' has 2 occurrences of 'zz' in the text.
<<<Output>>>
'v2sg'
