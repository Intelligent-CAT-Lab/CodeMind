Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(st):
    if st.lower().rindex('h', st.lower().rindex('i')) >= st.lower().rindex('i'):
        return 'Hey'
    else:
        return 'Hi'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Hi there')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string st as input and returns either 'Hey' or 'Hi'.
The function first converts st to lower case.
The function then finds the last index of the letter 'h' in st.
The function then finds the last index of the letter 'i' in st.
The function then checks if the last index of the letter 'h' is greater than or equal to the last index of the letter 'i'.
If the last index of the letter 'h' is greater than or equal to the last index of the letter 'i', then the function returns 'Hey'.
Otherwise, the function returns 'Hi'.
<<<Output>>>
'Hey'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    if s.lower().count('h') >= s.lower().count('i'):
        return 'Hey'
    else:
        return 'Hi'
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f('Hi there')`?
