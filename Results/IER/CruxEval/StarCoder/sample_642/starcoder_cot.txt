Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    i = 0
    while i < len(text) and text[i].isspace():
        i+=1
    if i == len(text):
        return'space'
    return 'no'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("     ")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the string'space' if the first non-space character in text is a space, and returns the string 'no' otherwise.
The first non-space character in "     " is the space character, so the function returns'space'.
<<<Output>>>
'space'

<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the string 'no' if the first non-space character in text is a space, and returns the string 'no' otherwise.
The first non-space character in "hi" is the letter 'h', so the function returns 'no'.
<<<Output>>>
