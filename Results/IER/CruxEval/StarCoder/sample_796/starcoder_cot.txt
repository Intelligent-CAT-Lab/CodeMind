Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(str,toget):
    if str.startswith(toget): return str[len(toget):]
    else: return str
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('fnuiyh', 'ni')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: str and toget.
The function checks if str starts with toget.
If str starts with toget, the function returns the substring of str that starts at the index after toget.
If str does not start with toget, the function returns str.

<<<Output>>>
'uiyh'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    if s.startswith('a'): return s[1:]
    else: return s
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f('b')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input.
The function checks if s starts with 'a'.
If s starts with 'a', the function returns the substring of s that starts at the index after 'a'.
If s does not start with 'a', the function returns s.

<<<Output>>>
