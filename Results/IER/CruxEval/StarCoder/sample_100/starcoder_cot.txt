Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(d, rm):
    res = d.copy()
    for k in rm:
        if k in res:
            del res[k]
    return res
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f({'1': 'a', 1: 'a', 1: 'b', '1': 'b'}, [1])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a dictionary d and a list rm as input.
The function creates a new dictionary res by copying the content of d.
The function iterates through the keys of d and rm.
If the key is in rm, the key-value pair is deleted from res.
The function returns res.

<<<Output>>>
{'1': 'a', '1': 'b'}
