Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(sentence):
    if sentence == '':
        return ''
    sentence = sentence.replace('(', '')
    sentence = sentence.replace(')', '')
    return sentence.capitalize().replace(' ', '')
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('(A (b B))')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string sentence as input and returns the capitalized version of the sentence.
The function first replaces all the characters '(' with the empty string ''.
Then it replaces all the characters ')' with the empty string ''.
Finally, it capitalizes the sentence and replaces all the spaces with the empty string ''.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input '(A (b B))' is 'AB'.
<<<Output>>>
'AB'

Consider the following code:

def f(s):
    if s == '':
        return ''
    if s[0] =='':
        return f(s[1:])
    if s[-1] =='':
        return f(s[:-1])
    return s
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f('  hello  ')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the string s.
The function first checks if s is the empty string ''.
If so, the function returns the empty string ''.
Next, the function checks if the first character of s is a space''.
If so, the function returns the function f applied to the string s[1:].
Otherwise, the function checks if the last character of s is a space''.
If so, the function returns the function f applied to the string s[:-1].
Otherwise, the function returns s.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input' hello 'is 'hello'.
<<<Output>>>
'hello'
