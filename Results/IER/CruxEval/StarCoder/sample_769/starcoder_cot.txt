Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    text_list = [char for char in text]
    for i, char in enumerate(text_list):
        text_list[i] = char.swapcase()
    return ''.join(text_list)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('akA?riu')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the string with all the characters in the string swapped.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "akA?riu", we need to swap the case of all the characters in the string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "akA?riu" is "AKa?RIU".
<<<Output>>>
'AKa?RIU'
