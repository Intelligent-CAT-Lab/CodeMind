Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    if not text.endswith(char):
        return f(char + text, char)
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('staovk', 'k')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, text and char.
If the input text does not end with the input char, then the function f calls itself again with the concatenation of the input char and text as the new input text and the same input char.
If the input text does end with the input char, then the function f returns the input text.

<<<Output>>>
'staovk'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * f(n-1)
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f(3)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an integer n as input.
If the input n is equal to 0, then the function f returns 1.
If the input n is not equal to 0, then the function f returns the product of the input n and the return value of the function f called on the input n-1.

<<<Output>>>
