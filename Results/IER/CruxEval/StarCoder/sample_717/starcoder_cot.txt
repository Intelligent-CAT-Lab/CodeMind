Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    (k, l) = (0, len(text) - 1)
    while not text[l].isalpha():
        l -= 1
    while not text[k].isalpha():
        k += 1
    if k!= 0 or l!= len(text) - 1:
        return text[k: l+1]
    else:
        return text[0]

What would be the return value of `f("timetable, 2mil")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the substring of text that contains only alphabetic characters.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "timetable, 2mil", we need to find the first and last alphabetic characters in the string.
The first alphabetic character is "t" and the last alphabetic character is "m".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "timetable, 2mil" is "timetable".
<<<Output>>>
'timetable'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    if len(text) == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 + f(text[1:])
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the number of characters in text.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to count the number of characters in the string.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is 2.
<<<Output>>>
