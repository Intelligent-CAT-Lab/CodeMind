Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    result = []
    index = 0
    while index < len(array):
        result.append(array.pop())
        index += 2
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The new array contains the elements of the input array that are at odd indices.
The input array is [8, 8, -4, -9, 2, 8, -1, 8].
The elements at odd indices are 8, -4, -1, and 8.
The new array is [8, -4, -1, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[8, -4, -1, 8]

The elements that are positive are 8, 2, and 8.
The new array is [8, 2, 8].
