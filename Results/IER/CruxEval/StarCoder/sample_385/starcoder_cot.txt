Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(lst):
    i = 0
    new_list = []
    while i < len(lst):
        if lst[i] in lst[i+1:]:
            new_list.append(lst[i])
            if len(new_list) == 3:
                return new_list
        i += 1
    return new_list
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([0, 2, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 0])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list lst as input and returns a list of the first three elements of lst that are repeated.
The first step is to initialize the variable i to 0.
The next step is to initialize the variable new_list to an empty list.
The next step is to iterate through the list lst.
The next step is to check if the element lst[i] is in the list lst[i+1:].
If the element lst[i] is in the list lst[i+1:], then append lst[i] to the list new_list.
If the length of the list new_list is equal to 3, then return the list new_list.
The next step is to increment i by 1.
The next step is to return the list new_list.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 2, 2]
