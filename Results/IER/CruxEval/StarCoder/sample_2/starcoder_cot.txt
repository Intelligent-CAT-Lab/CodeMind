Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    new_text = list(text)
    for i in '+':
        if i in new_text:
            new_text.remove(i)
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('hbtofdeiequ')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string new_text.
The new_text is a list of characters in text.
For each character in text, if the character is in '+', then remove the character from new_text.
Finally, return the string that is the concatenation of the characters in new_text.
<<<Output>>>
'hbtfdeiequ'
