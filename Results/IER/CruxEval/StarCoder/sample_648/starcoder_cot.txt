Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(list1, list2):
    l = list1[:]
    while len(l) > 0:
        if l[-1] in list2:
            l.pop()
        else:
            return l[-1]
    return'missing'
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([0, 4, 5, 6], [13, 23, -5, 0])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two lists as input and returns the last element of the list that is not in the second list.
The list [0, 4, 5, 6] is the first list and the list [13, 23, -5, 0] is the second list.
The list [0, 4, 5, 6] is copied to the list l.
The length of the list l is 4.
The last element of the list l is 6.
6 is not in the list [13, 23, -5, 0].
The last element of the list l is 5.
5 is not in the list [13, 23, -5, 0].
The last element of the list l is 4.
4 is not in the list [13, 23, -5, 0].
The last element of the list l is 0.
0 is in the list [13, 23, -5, 0].
The function returns 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
