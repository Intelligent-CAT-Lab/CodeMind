Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    array.extend(elem)
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1], [[1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs: an array and an element.
The function f adds the element to the array and returns the array.
The input to the function f is [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1], [[1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]].
The first element of the input is an array, and the second element is an array.
The first array is [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1].
The second array is [[1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]].
The function f adds the second array to the first array and returns the first array.
The output of the function f is [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]].
<<<Output>>>
[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]
