Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s, c):
    s = s.split(' ')
    return ((c + "  ") + ("  ".join(s[::-1])))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('Hello There', '*')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, s and c.
The input s is a string.
The input c is a string.
The function f first splits s into a list of strings.
The function f then concatenates c with the string "  ".
The function f then concatenates the string "  " with the list of strings in reverse order.
The function f then returns the concatenated string.
<<<Output>>>
'*  Hello There'

    return s[::-1]
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f('Hello There')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input.
The function f then returns the string s in reverse order.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[1:3]
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f('Hello There')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input.
The function f then returns the string s from the second character to the third character.
<<<Output>>>
'el'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[1:]
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f('Hello There')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input.
The function f then returns the string s from the second character to the end of the string.
<<<Output>>>
'ello There'
