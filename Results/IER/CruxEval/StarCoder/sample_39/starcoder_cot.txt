Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    if elem in array:
        return array.index(elem)
    return -1
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([6, 2, 7, 1], 6)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array and an element as input.
If the element is in the array, the function returns the index of the element in the array.
If the element is not in the array, the function returns -1.
The array is [6, 2, 7, 1].
The element is 6.
6 is in the array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 2, 7, 1], 6 is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    if elem in array:

    return -1
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([6, 2, 7, 1], 8)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array and an element as input.
If the element is in the array, the function returns the index of the element in the array.
If the element is not in the array, the function returns -1.
The array is [6, 2, 7, 1].
The element is 8.
8 is not in the array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [6, 2, 7, 1], 8 is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
