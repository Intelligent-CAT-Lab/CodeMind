Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    if len(text) == 0:
        return ''
    text = text.lower()
    return text[0].upper() + text[1:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('xzd')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns the first letter of the string in upper case and the rest of the string in lower case.
The string 'xzd' has length 3.
The first letter of the string 'xzd' is 'x'.
The rest of the string 'xzd' is 'zd'.
The first letter of the string 'xzd' in upper case is 'X'.
The rest of the string 'xzd' in lower case is 'zd'.
The return value of the function f on the input 'xzd' is 'Xzd'.
<<<Output>>>
'Xzd'
