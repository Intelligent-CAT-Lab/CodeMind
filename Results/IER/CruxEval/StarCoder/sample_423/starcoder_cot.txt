Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(selfie):
    lo = len(selfie)
    for i in range(lo-1, -1, -1):
        if selfie[i] == selfie[0]:
            selfie.remove(selfie[lo-1])
    return selfie
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6], we need to remove all the duplicates from the list.
The list [4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6] contains 6 elements.
The first element of the list is 4.
The last element of the list is 6.
