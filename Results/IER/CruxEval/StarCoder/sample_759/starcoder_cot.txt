Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, sub):
    index = []
    starting = 0
    while starting!= -1:
        starting = text.find(sub, starting)
        if starting!= -1:
            index.append(starting)
            starting += len(sub)
    return index
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('egmdartoa', 'good')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, text and sub.
The function returns a list of indices of sub in text.
The function first initializes an empty list index.
The function then initializes an integer starting to 0.
The function then enters a while loop that runs as long as starting is not equal to -1.
The function then finds the first occurrence of sub in text starting from the index starting.
If the function finds an occurrence of sub in text starting from the index starting, the function appends the index starting to the list index.
The function then increments starting by the length of sub.
The function then returns the list index.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 10]
