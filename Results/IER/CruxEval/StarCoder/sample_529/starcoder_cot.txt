Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    prev = array[0]
    newArray = array[:]
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        if prev!= array[i]:
            newArray[i] = array[i]
        else:
            del newArray[i]
        prev = array[i]
    return newArray
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The new array is a copy of the input array.
The new array is modified by removing the duplicate elements in the input array.
The new array is modified by keeping the non-duplicate elements in the input array.
The new array is returned.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    newArray = []
    for i in range(len(array)):
        if array[i] % 2 == 0:
            newArray.append(array[i])
    return newArray
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f([1, 2, 3])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array.
The new array is a copy of the input array.
The new array is modified by removing the odd elements in the input array.
The new array is returned.
<<<Output>>>
