Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(price, product):
    inventory = ['olives', 'key', 'orange']
    if product not in inventory:
        return price
    else:
        price *=.85
        inventory.remove(product)
    return price
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(8.50, 'grapes')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, price and product.
The function first checks if the product is in the inventory.
If the product is not in the inventory, the function returns the price.
If the product is in the inventory, the function multiplies the price by.85 and removes the product from the inventory.
The function returns the price.
<<<Output>>>
8.50
