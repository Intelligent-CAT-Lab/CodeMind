Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(values):
    names = ['Pete', 'Linda', 'Angela']
    names.extend(values)
    names.sort()
    return names
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(['Dan', 'Joe', 'Dusty'])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of strings.
The function f first creates a list of strings names with the three strings 'Pete', 'Linda', and 'Angela'.
The function f then extends the list of strings names with the list of strings ['Dan', 'Joe', 'Dusty'].
The function f then sorts the list of strings names.
The function f then returns the list of strings names.
<<<Output>>>
['Angela', 'Dan', 'Dusty', 'Joe', 'Linda', 'Pete']
