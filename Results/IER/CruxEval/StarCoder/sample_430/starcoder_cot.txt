Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(arr1, arr2):
    new_arr = arr1.copy()
    new_arr.extend(arr2)
    return new_arr
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([5, 1, 3, 7, 8], ['', 0, -1, []])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two arrays as input and returns a new array that is the concatenation of the two input arrays.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 1, 3, 7, 8], ['', 0, -1, []], we need to concatenate [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] with ['', 0, -1, []].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 1, 3, 7, 8], ['', 0, -1, []] is [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, '', 0, -1, []]

Consider the following code:

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] % 2 == 0:
            new_arr.append(arr[i])

</Code>
What would be the return value of `f([5, 1, 3, 7, 8])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a new array that contains only the even elements of the input array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 1, 3, 7, 8], we need to iterate through the array and append the even elements to a new array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] is [5, 3, 8].
<<<Output>>>
[5, 3, 8]
