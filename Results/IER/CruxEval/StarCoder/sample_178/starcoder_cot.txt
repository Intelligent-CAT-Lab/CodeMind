Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, n):
    return array[n:]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2], 4)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array and an integer n as input.
The function returns the array starting from the index n.
The array is [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2].
The integer n is 4.
The array starting from the index n is [1, 2, 2, 2, 2].
The return value of the function f on the input [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2], 4 is [1, 2, 2, 2, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 2, 2, 2]
