Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, delim):
    return text[:text[::-1].find(delim)][::-1]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('dsj osq wi w','')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, text and delim.
The function returns the reverse of the substring of text that is before the first occurrence of delim.
The reverse of the substring of text that is before the first occurrence of delim is the reverse of the substring of text that is after the last occurrence of delim.
The substring of text that is after the last occurrence of delim is the substring of text that is before the first occurrence of delim.
The substring of text that is before the first occurrence of delim is the reverse of the substring of text that is after the last occurrence of delim.
The reverse of the substring of text that is after the last occurrence of delim is the reverse of the substring of text that is before the first occurrence of delim.
The reverse of the substring of text that is before the first occurrence of delim is the substring of text that is after the last occurrence of delim.
The substring of text that is after the last occurrence of delim is the substring of text that is before the first occurrence of delim.
The substring of text that is before the first occurrence of delim is the reverse of the substring of text that is after the last occurrence of delim.
The reverse of the substring of text that is after the last occurrence of delim is the reverse of the substring of text that is before the first occurrence of delim.
The reverse of the substring of text that is before the first occurrence of delim is the substring of text that is after the last occurrence of delim.
