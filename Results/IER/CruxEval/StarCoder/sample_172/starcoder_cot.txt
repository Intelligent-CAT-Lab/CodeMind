Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    for i in range(len(array)):
        if array[i] < 0:
            array.pop(i)
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns the array after removing all negative numbers from the array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [], we need to remove all negative numbers from [].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [] is [].
<<<Output>>>
[]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):

    return array

What would be the return value of `f([-1, 2, -3, 4, -5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns the array after removing all negative numbers from the array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5], we need to remove all negative numbers from [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5].
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5] is [2, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 4]
