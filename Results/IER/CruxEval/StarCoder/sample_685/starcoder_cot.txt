Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    return array.count(elem) + elem
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 1, 1], -2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array and an element as input and returns the sum of the number of times that the element appears in the array plus the element.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1] and -2, we need to count the number of times -2 appears in the array [1, 1, 1] and add -2 to the sum.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1] and -2 is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    array.append(elem)
    return array
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f([1, 1, 1], -2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array and an element as input and appends the element to the array and returns the array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1] and -2, we need to append -2 to the array [1, 1, 1] and return the array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1] and -2 is [-2, 1, 1, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[-2, 1, 1, 1]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    array[0] = elem
    return array
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f([1, 1, 1], -2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array and an element as input and replaces the first element of the array with the element and returns the array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 1]
