Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    ls = text[::-1]
    text2 = ''
    for i in range(len(ls) - 3, 0, -3):
        text2 += '---'.join(ls[i:i + 3]) + '---'
    return text2[:-3]
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('scala')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a string.
The string text is reversed to get ls.
The string text2 is initialized to the empty string.
The for loop iterates over the indices of ls from the last to the first.
The indices are incremented by 3.
The string text2 is updated by concatenating the string '---' with the string '---'.join(ls[i:i + 3]) and the string '---'.
The string text2 is returned.
<<<Output>>>
'scala'
