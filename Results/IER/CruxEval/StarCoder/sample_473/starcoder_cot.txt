Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, value):
    indexes = list()
    for i in range(len(text)):
        if text[i] == value:
            indexes.append(i)
    new_text = list(text)
    for i in indexes:
        new_text.remove(value)
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('scedvtvotkwqfoqn', 'o')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, text and value.
The function creates a list named indexes.
The function iterates through the characters in text and appends the index of the character to indexes if the character is equal to value.
The function creates a new list named new_text and copies the characters in text to new_text.
The function iterates through the indexes and removes the character at the index from new_text.
The function returns the string created from the characters in new_text.
<<<Output>>>
'scedvtvotkwqfn'
