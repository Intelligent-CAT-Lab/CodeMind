Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, x):
    if text.removeprefix(x) == text:
        return f(text[1:], x)
    else:
        return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("Ibaskdjgblw asdl ", "djgblw")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, text and x.
The function checks if the text starts with the string x.
If the text does not start with the string x, the function returns the text.
If the text starts with the string x, the function returns the function f on the text without the first x characters and the same x.
<<<Output>>>
'asdl '
