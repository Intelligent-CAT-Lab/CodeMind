Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    n = array.pop()
    array.extend([n, n])
    return array
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([1, 1, 2, 2])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns the array with the last element and the last element added to the end of the array.
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 2, 2], we need to pop the last element from the array, add the popped element to the end of the array, and return the array.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input [1, 1, 2, 2] is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
