Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, suffix):
    if suffix == '':
        suffix = None
    return text.endswith(suffix)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('uMeGndkGh', 'kG')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two inputs, text and suffix.
If the suffix is an empty string, then the suffix is set to None.
The function returns True if the text ends with the suffix, and False otherwise.
The text is 'uMeGndkGh' and the suffix is 'kG'.
The text ends with the suffix, so the function returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
