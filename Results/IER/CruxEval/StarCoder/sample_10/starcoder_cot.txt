Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    new_text = ''
    for ch in text.lower().strip():
        if ch.isnumeric() or ch in 'ÄäÏïÖöÜü':
            new_text += ch
    return new_text
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string text as input and returns a new string new_text.
The new_text is initialized to the empty string.
The for loop iterates over the characters in the string text.
The characters are converted to lower case and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
The if statement checks if the character is a number or a letter.
If the character is a number or a letter, the character is added to the new_text.
The return value of the function is the new_text.
<<<Output>>>
