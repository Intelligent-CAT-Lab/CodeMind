Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, search):
    result = text.lower()
    return result.find(search.lower())
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('car hat', 'car')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes two strings as input, text and search.
The function first converts both text and search to lower case.
The function then returns the index of the first occurrence of search in text.
<<<Output>>>
