Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(numbers):
    floats = [n % 1 for n in numbers]
    return floats if 1 in floats else []
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(range(100, 120))`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of floats.
The list of floats is generated by taking the remainder of each number in the input list by 1.
The list of floats is then returned.
The list of floats is returned if 1 is in the list of floats.
The list of floats is returned if 1 is in the list of floats.
