Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, substr, occ):
    n = 0
    while True:
        i = text.rfind(substr)
        if i == -1:
            break
        elif n == occ:
            return i
        else:
            n += 1
            text = text[:i]
    return -1

What would be the return value of `f('zjegiymjc', 'j', 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes three inputs: text, substr, and occ.
The function f returns the index of the last occurrence of substr in text.
The function f returns -1 if substr is not found in text.
The function f returns -1 if the last occurrence of substr is before the occ-th occurrence of substr.
The function f returns the index of the last occurrence of substr in text.
<<<Output>>>
-1
