Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    return text.isascii()
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('wW의IV]HDJjhgK[dGIUlVO@Ess$coZkBqu[Ct')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string as input and returns whether the string is ascii or not.
The string 'wW의IV]HDJjhgK[dGIUlVO@Ess$coZkBqu[Ct' contains non-ascii characters.
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input 'wW의IV]HDJjhgK[dGIUlVO@Ess$coZkBqu[Ct' is False.
<<<Output>>>
False
