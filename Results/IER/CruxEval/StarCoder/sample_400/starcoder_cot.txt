Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(multi_string):
    cond_string = map(str.isascii, multi_string.split())
    if True in cond_string:
        return ', '.join(x for x in multi_string.split() if x.isascii())
    return ''
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f('I am hungry! eat food.')`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string multi_string as input and returns the string that is the concatenation of the strings in the list that is the result of applying the function str.isascii to the list of strings that is the result of applying the function split to the input multi_string.
The function str.isascii takes a string as input and returns True if the string is composed of all ASCII characters and False otherwise.
The function split takes a string as input and returns a list of strings that are the result of splitting the input string on the character''.
The function map takes a function and a list as input and returns a list of the results of applying the function to each element of the list.
The function join takes a string and a list as input and returns the string that is the concatenation of the strings in the list.
The function x for x in multi_string.split() if x.isascii() returns the string that is the concatenation of the strings in the list that is the result of applying the function split to the input multi_string, where each string in the list is the result of applying the function isascii to the string.
The function True in cond_string returns True if the list that is the result of applying the function map to the function str.isascii to the list of strings that is the result of applying the function split to the input multi_string contains True and False otherwise.
The function if True in cond_string: returns the string that is the concatenation of the strings in the list that is the result of applying the function split to the input multi_string, where each string in the list is the result of applying the function isascii to the string, if the list that is the result of applying the function map to the function str.isascii to the list of strings that is the result of applying the function split to the input multi_string contains True.
The function return '' returns the empty string if the list that is the result of applying the function map to the function str.isascii to the list of strings that is the result of applying the function split to the input multi_string does not contain True.
<<<Output>>>
'I, am, hungry, eat, food.'
