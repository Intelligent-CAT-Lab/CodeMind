Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(xs):
    for i in range(-1, -len(xs)-1, -1):
        xs.extend([xs[i], xs[i]])
    return xs
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([4, 8, 8, 5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list xs as input and returns the list xs with the elements of xs doubled.
The for loop iterates over the list xs in reverse order.
The range function returns a list of integers from -1 to -len(xs)-1 with a step of -1.
The list xs is extended with the elements of xs doubled.
The list xs is returned.
<<<Output>>>
[4, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 5]
