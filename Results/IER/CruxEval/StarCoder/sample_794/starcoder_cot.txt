Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(line):
    a = []
    for c in line:
        if c.isalnum():
            a.append(c)
    return ''.join(a)
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f("\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string line as input and returns a string.
The string line is a sequence of characters.
The function f creates an empty list a.
The function f iterates through each character c in line.
The function f appends c to a if c is alphanumeric.
The function f returns the string that is the concatenation of the characters in a.
<<<Output>>>
'normalcharsqwet42'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[0]
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("abc")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the first character of s.
The string s is a sequence of characters.
The first character of s is the first character in the sequence.
The function f returns the first character of s.
<<<Output>>>
'a'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s[-1]
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("abc")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the last character of s.
The string s is a sequence of characters.
The last character of s is the last character in the sequence.
The function f returns the last character of s.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):

</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("abc")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the substring of s starting at index 1 and ending at index 3.
The string s is a
