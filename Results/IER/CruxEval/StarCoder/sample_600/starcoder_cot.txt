Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    just_ns = list(map(lambda num: 'n'*num, array))
    final_output = []
    for wipe in just_ns:
        final_output.append(wipe)
    return final_output
<Code>

What would be the return value of `f([])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes an array as input and returns a list of strings.
The list of strings is created by mapping the function lambda num: 'n'*num over the input array.
The lambda function takes a number num as input and returns the string 'n'*num.
The map function takes the lambda function and applies it to each element of the input array.
The list of strings is created by collecting the output of the lambda function for each element of the input array.
The list of strings is created by concatenating the strings in the list of strings.
The list of strings is created by appending the strings in the list of strings to a new list.
The list of strings is returned.
<<<Output>>>
[]
