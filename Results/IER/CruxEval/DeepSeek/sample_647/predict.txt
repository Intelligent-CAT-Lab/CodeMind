The function `f` is defined to take two parameters: `text` and `chunks`. The function `splitlines` is a built-in Python method that splits a string into a list where each line is a list item. The `chunks` parameter is used as the key to split the `text`.

However, the `splitlines` method does not take a `chunks` parameter. It splits the string at newline characters by default.

The function `f` is called with the input `('/alcm@ an)t//eprw)/e!/d\nujv', 0)`. The first argument is a string, and the second argument is an integer. The string is split at each newline character by default, but the integer is not used as a key to split the string.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `('/alcm@ an)t//eprw)/e!/d\nujv', 0)` is a list of lines in the string, where each line is a list item. The string is not split at the character at index 0.

Here is the Python code to execute the function:

```python
def f(text, chunks):
    return text.splitlines(chunks)

print(f('/alcm@ an)t//eprw)/e!/d\nujv', 0))
```

And the output will be:

```python
['/alcm@ an)t//eprw)/e!/d\nujv']
```

This is because the `splitlines` method splits the string at each newline character by default, and the string `'/alcm@ an)t//eprw)/e!/d\nujv'` only contains one newline character, so it is split into two lines.

Please note that the `splitlines` method does not take a `chunks` parameter, so the integer `0` is ignored.
