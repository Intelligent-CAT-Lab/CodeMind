### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array, elem):
    elem = str(elem)
    d = 0
    for i in array:
        if str(i) == elem:
            d += 1
    return d
<Code>

What would be the return value of`f([-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2], 2)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes an array and an element as input. The element is converted to a string. A counter `d` is initialized to 0. The function then iterates over each element in the array. If the string representation of the current element in the array is equal to the string representation of the input element, the counter `d` is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the value of `d`, which represents the number of occurrences of the input element in the array.

To determine the output of executing the function `f` on the input `([-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2], 2)`, we need to count the number of times the number 2 appears in the array `[-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2]`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `([-1, 2, 1, -8, -8, 2], 2)` is 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
