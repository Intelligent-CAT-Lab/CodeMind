I'm sorry, but the code you provided will result in a recursion error. The function `f` is recursively calling itself with an increasing argument `n`, which will lead to an infinite recursion if `n` is not initially 0. This is because the base case for the recursion is `n == 0`, but there's no mechanism to ensure that `n` eventually reaches 0. Therefore, the function will keep calling itself indefinitely without ever reaching the base case.

If you want to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n`, you should use a loop instead of recursion. Here's how you can do it:

```python
def f(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        sum += i
    return sum
```

This function will calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` correctly.

If you want to use recursion, you should ensure that the base case eventually reaches 0. Here's an example:

```python
def f(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return n + f(n-1)
```

This function will calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` correctly.

Please provide the correct code for the problem you're trying to solve.
