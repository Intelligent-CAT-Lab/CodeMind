### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, chars):
    if chars:
        text = text.rstrip(chars)
    else:
        text = text.rstrip(' ')
    if text == '':
        return '-'
    return text
<Code>

What would be the return value of`f('new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', '0123456789-')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `text` and `chars`. The function checks if `chars` is not empty. If `chars` is not empty, it removes the trailing characters in `text` that match any character in `chars`. If `chars` is empty, it removes the trailing spaces in `text`. If the resulting `text` is an empty string, it returns '-'. Otherwise, it returns the resulting `text`.

To determine the output of executing the function `f` on the input `'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', '0123456789-'`, we need to remove the trailing characters in the string 'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2' that match any character in '0123456789-'.

After removing the trailing characters, the resulting string is 'new-medium-performing-application'. Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `'new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2', '0123456789-'` is 'new-medium-performing-application'.

<<<Output>>>
'new-medium-performing-application'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Note: The Python `rstrip()` method removes trailing characters from a string. If no argument is provided, it removes trailing spaces.
