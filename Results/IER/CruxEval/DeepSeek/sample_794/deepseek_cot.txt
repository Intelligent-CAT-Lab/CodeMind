### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(line):
    a = []
    for c in line:
        if c.isalnum():
            a.append(c)
    return ''.join(a)
<Code>

What would be the return value of`f("\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `line` as input and returns a new string that consists of only the alphanumeric characters from `line`.

The function works by iterating over each character `c` in `line`. If `c` is alphanumeric (i.e., either a letter or a number), it is appended to the list `a`.

After all characters in `line` have been processed, the function joins `a` into a single string using the `join` method and returns this string.

To determine the output of executing the function `f` on the input `"\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'"`, we need to process each character in the string.

The string contains the following characters:
- The first character is a backslash `\`, which is not alphanumeric, so it is ignored.
- The second character is a percent sign `%`, which is not alphanumeric, so it is ignored.
- The third character is a dollar sign `$`, which is not alphanumeric, so it is ignored.
- The fourth character is a normal character `n`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The fifth character is a normal character `o`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The sixth character is a normal character `r`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The seventh character is a normal character `m`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The eighth character is a normal character `a`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The ninth character is a normal character `l`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The tenth character is a space ` `, which is not alphanumeric, so it is ignored.
- The eleventh character is a normal character `c`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The twelfth character is a normal character `h`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The thirteenth character is a normal character `a`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The fourteenth character is a normal character `r`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The fifteenth character is a normal character `s`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The sixteenth character is a space ` `, which is not alphanumeric, so it is ignored.
- The seventeenth character is a normal character `q`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The eighteenth character is a normal character `w`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The nineteenth character is a normal character `e`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The twentieth character is a normal character `t`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The twenty-first character is a number `4`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.
- The twenty-second character is a number `2`, which is alphanumeric, so it is appended to the list `a`.

After processing all characters, the function joins `a` into a single string using the `join` method.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `"\"\\%$ normal chars $%~ qwet42'"` is `"normalcharsqwet42"`.
<<<Output>>>
'normalcharsqwet42'
