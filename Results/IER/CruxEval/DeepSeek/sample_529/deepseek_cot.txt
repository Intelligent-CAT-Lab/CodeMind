### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(array):
    prev = array[0]
    newArray = array[:]
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        if prev != array[i]:
            newArray[i] = array[i]
        else:
            del newArray[i]
        prev = array[i]
    return newArray
<Code>

What would be the return value of`f([1, 2, 3])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list `array` as input. It initializes a variable `prev` to the first element of the list and a new list `newArray` which is a copy of the input list. Then it iterates over the elements of the list starting from the second element. For each element, it checks if the current element is equal to the previous one. If they are equal, it removes the current element from `newArray`. Otherwise, it updates `prev` to the current element and continues to the next iteration. Finally, it returns the `newArray`.

To determine the output of executing the function `f` on the input `[1, 2, 3]`, we need to follow the steps of the function.

1. Initialize `prev` to the first element of the list, which is `1`.
2. Initialize `newArray` to be a copy of the input list, which is `[1, 2, 3]`.
3. Iterate over the elements of the list starting from the second element.
4. For each element, check if it is equal to the previous one.
5. If they are equal, remove the current element from `newArray`.
6. If they are not equal, update `prev` to the current element and continue to the next iteration.
7. Finally, return the `newArray`.

Given the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the output of the function `f` would be `[1, 2, 3]` because there are no consecutive equal elements in the list.

<<<Output>>>
`[1, 2, 3]`
