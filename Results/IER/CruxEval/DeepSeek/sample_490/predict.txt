The function `f` takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of substrings that are separated by spaces in `s`.

The function uses the `split()` method with one argument: the character to split the string on (which is a space `' '`). The `split()` method splits the string at each occurrence of the specified character and returns a list of the substrings.

To determine the output of executing the function `f` on the input `"h e l l o"`, we need to split the string at each space.

In the input string, there are 4 spaces. If we split the string at each space, we get a list with 5 elements: `['h', '', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `"h e l l o
