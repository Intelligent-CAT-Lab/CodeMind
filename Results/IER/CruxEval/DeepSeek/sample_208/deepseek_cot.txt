### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        for d in item:
            if not d.isdigit():
                result.append(d)
    return result
<Code>

What would be the return value of`f(['123', 'cat', 'd dee'])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list of strings as input. It initializes an empty list `result`. Then it iterates over each string in the input list. For each string, it iterates over each character in the string. If the character is not a digit (determined by the `isdigit()` method), it appends the character to the `result` list. Finally, it returns the `result` list.

To determine the output of executing the function `f` on the input `['123', 'cat', 'd dee']`, we need to follow the steps of the function:

1. Initialize an empty list `result`.
2. Iterate over each string in the input list.
3. For each string, iterate over each character in the string.
4. If the character is not a digit, append the character to the `result` list.
5. Return the `result` list.

So, for the first string '123', we ignore it because it's a digit. For the second string 'cat', we append the characters 'c' and 'a' to the `result` list. For the third string 'd dee', we append the characters 'd', ' ', and 'e' to the `result` list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `['123', 'cat', 'd dee']` is `['c', 'a', 't', 'd', ' ', 'e', 'e']`.
<<<Output>>>
['c', 'a', 't', 'd', ' ', 'e', 'e']
