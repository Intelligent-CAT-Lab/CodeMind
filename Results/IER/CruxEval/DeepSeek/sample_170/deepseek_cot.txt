### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, number):
    return nums.count(number)
<Code>

What would be the return value of`f([12, 0, 13, 4, 12], 12)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a list of numbers nums and a number number as input. The function returns the count of the number in the list nums.

To determine the output of executing the function f on the input ([12, 0, 13, 4, 12], 12), we need to count the number 12 in the list [12, 0, 13, 4, 12].

Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input ([12, 0, 13, 4, 12], 12) is 2.

Because the number 12 appears twice in the list [12, 0, 13, 4, 12].

<<<Output>>>
2
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

In Python, the built-in function count() is used to count the number of occurrences of an element in a list. The count() function returns the number of times a specified value appears in the list.

Here is the Python code:

```python
def f(nums, number):
    return nums.count(number)

print(f([12, 0, 13, 4, 12], 12))  # Output: 2
```

In this code, the function f takes a list of numbers nums and a number number as input. It returns the count of the number in the list nums. The count() method is called on the list nums with the number as the argument. The count of the number in the list is returned.

When we call f([12, 0, 13, 4, 12], 12), it returns 2 because the number 12 appears twice in the list [12, 0, 13, 4, 12].
