### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    if char in text:
        text = [t.strip() for t in text.split(char) if t]
        if len(text) > 1:
            return True
    return False
<Code>

What would be the return value of`f('only one line', ' ')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `text` and `char`. The function checks if `char` is in `text`. If `char` is found in `text`, the function splits `text` at each occurrence of `char` and stores the resulting substrings in a list. The function then checks if the length of the list is greater than 1. If it is, the function returns `True`. If `char` is not found in `text` or if the length of the list is not greater than 1, the function returns `False`.

In the case of `f('only one line', ' ')`, the function is checking if the space character (' ') is in the string 'only one line'. It is, so the function splits 'only one line' at each space and stores the resulting substrings in a list. The list is `['only', 'one', 'line']`. Since the length of the list is greater than 1, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `('only one line', ' ')` is `True`.

<<<Output>>>
True
