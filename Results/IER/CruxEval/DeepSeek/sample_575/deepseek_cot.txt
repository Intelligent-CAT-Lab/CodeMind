You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the Deepseek Coder model, developed by Deepseek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science. For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.

### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(nums, val):
    new_list = []
    [new_list.extend([i] * val) for i in nums]
    return sum(new_list)
<Code>

What would be the return value of`f([10, 4], 3)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list of numbers `nums` and a value `val` as input. It creates a new list `new_list` and for each number `i` in `nums`, it extends `new_list` by `val` copies of `i`. Finally, it returns the sum of all numbers in `new_list`.

To determine the output of executing the function `f` on the input `([10, 4], 3)`, we need to understand how the function `extend` works in Python. The `extend` method adds the elements of an iterable (such as list, string, etc.) to the end of the list. It does not return any value but updates existing list.

In the given code, for each number `i` in `nums`, it extends `new_list` by `val` copies of `i`. So, for the input `([10, 4], 3)`, `new_list` will be `[10, 10, 10, 4, 4, 4]`. Then, it returns the sum of all numbers in `new_list`, which is `10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 48`.

So, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `([10, 4], 3)` is `48`.

<<<Output>>>
48
