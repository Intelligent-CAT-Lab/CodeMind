The function `f` takes an integer `n` as input. The function uses a recursive approach to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`.

The base case of the recursion is when `n` is 0. In this case, the function returns 0.

In the recursive case, the function returns `n` plus the result of calling `f(n-1)`. This is because we want to add `n` to the sum of all integers from
