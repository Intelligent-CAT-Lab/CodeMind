### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, sub):
    index = []
    starting = 0
    while starting != -1:
        starting = text.find(sub, starting)
        if starting != -1:
            index.append(starting)
            starting += len(sub)
    return index
<Code>

What would be the return value of`f('egmdartoa', 'good')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `text` and `sub`. The function is designed to find all occurrences of the substring `sub` in the string `text` and return their starting indices in the order they appear in the string.

The function uses a while loop to iterate over the string `text`. The variable `starting` is used to keep track of the current position in the string where the search for the substring `sub` starts.

Inside the loop, the `find` method is used to find the next occurrence of the substring `sub` in the string `text` starting from the current position `starting`. The index of this occurrence is added to the list `index`.

After finding the next occurrence, `starting` is incremented by the length of the substring `sub`. This is done to ensure that the next search for the substring `sub` starts from the position right after the current occurrence.

The loop continues until `find` returns -1, which indicates that the substring `sub` is not found in the string `text` starting from the current position `starting`.

Finally, the function returns the list `index`, which contains the starting indices of all occurrences of the substring `sub` in the string `text`.

For the input `f('egmdartoa', 'good')`, the function is searching for the substring 'good' in the string 'egmdartoa'. Since 'good' is not found in 'egmdartoa', the function returns an empty list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `('egmdartoa', 'good')` is `[]`.

<<<Output>>>
[]
