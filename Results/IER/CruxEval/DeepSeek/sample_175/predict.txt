The function `f` takes two parameters: a string `s` and an integer `amount`. The string `s` is split into lines using the `splitlines()` method, which splits the string at each newline character. The `max` function is used to find the maximum index of the last space character in each line. The `map` function is used with a lambda function to find the last space in each line. The `rfind` method is used to find the last occurrence of a space in each line. The `max` function is used again to find the maximum index of the last space in all lines.
