### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(base_list, nums):
    base_list.extend(nums)
    res = base_list.copy()
    for i in range(-len(nums), 0):
        res.append(res[i])
    return res
<Code>

What would be the return value of`f([9, 7, 5, 3, 1], [2, 4, 6, 8, 0])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `base_list` and `nums`. `base_list` is a list of integers and `nums` is a list of integers.

The first line of the function `f` extends `base_list` by adding all elements of `nums` to it. This means that `base_list` is modified to contain all its original elements plus all elements of `nums`.

The second line of the function `f` copies the elements of `base_list` into a new list `res`.

The third line of the function `f` starts a loop that iterates over the negative indices of `nums`. The loop appends the element at the index `i` of `res` to the end of `res`.

The function returns `res`, which is a list that contains all elements of `base_list` followed by all elements of `nums` repeated in the same order as they appear in `nums`.

To determine the output of executing the function `f` on the input `([9, 7, 5, 3, 1], [2, 4, 6, 8, 0])`, we need to follow the steps of the function.

First, `base_list` is extended by adding all elements of `nums` to it, resulting in `base_list` being `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]`.

Then, `res` is a copy of `base_list`, resulting in `res` being `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]`.

Finally, the loop starts at the last index of `nums` and goes to the first index of `nums`. For each iteration, it appends the element at the current index of `res` to the end of `res`. The loop ends after appending the first element of `nums` to the end of `res`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `([9, 7, 5, 3, 1], [2, 4, 6, 8, 0])` is `[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 0]`.

<<<Output>>>
`[9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 0]`
