The function `f` takes three parameters: `text`, `old`, and `new`. 

The first thing the function does is check if the length of `old` is greater than 3. If it is, the function returns the original `text` without any changes. This is because the function is designed to replace occurrences of `old` in `text` with `new`, but if `old` is longer than 3 characters, it's not possible to replace `old` with `new` in `text` without changing the length of `old`.

Next, the function checks if `old` is in `text` and if `text` contains a space. If `old` is in `text` and `text` does not contain a space, the function replaces all occurrences of `old` in `text` with `new` repeated the number of times equal to the length of `old`. This is done using the `replace` method of the string data type in Python.

Finally, if `old` is in `text` and `text` contains a space, the function enters a while loop that continues until `old` is no longer in `text`. In each iteration of the loop, the function replaces the first occurrence of `old` in `text` with `new`. This is done using the `replace` method of the string data type in Python.

The function returns the modified `text` after all these operations.

Given the input `('avacado', 'va', '-')`, the function first checks if the length of `old` is greater than 3. It is not, so it proceeds to the next step. Then it checks if `old` is in `text` and if `text` does not contain a space. Since 'va' is in 'avacado' and 'avacado' does not contain a space, it replaces all occurrences of 'va' in 'avacado' with '-' repeated twice, resulting in 'a-cado'.

Finally, since 'va' is still in 'a-cado', the function enters the while loop and replaces the first occurrence of 'va' with '-', resulting in 'a-cado'. The
