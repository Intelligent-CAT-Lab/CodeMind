### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text):
    new_text = []
    for character in text:
        if character.isupper():
            new_text.insert(len(new_text) // 2, character)
    if len(new_text) == 0:
        new_text = ['-']
    return ''.join(new_text)
<Code>

What would be the return value of`f('String matching is a big part of RexEx library.')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a string `text` as input. It creates an empty list `new_text`. Then it iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is uppercase (determined by the `isupper` method), it inserts the character into the middle of `new_text`. If the input string does not contain any uppercase characters, `new_text` remains empty and a single dash character `-` is inserted. Finally, it joins all the characters in `new_text` into a single string and returns it.

In the given example, the input string is 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.'. The uppercase characters in this string are 'S', 'm', 'i', 's', 'a', 'b', 'p', 'R', 'e', 'x', 'l', 'i', 'b', '.', so the characters are inserted into `new_text` at the middle, resulting in 'SbRmipaexlliisv'.

So, the output of executing the function `f` on the input 'String matching is a big part of RexEx library.' is 'SbRmipaexlliisv'.

<<<Output>>>
'SbRmipaexlliisv'
