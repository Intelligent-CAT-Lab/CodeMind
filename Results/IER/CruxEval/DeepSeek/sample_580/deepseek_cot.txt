### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, char):
    new_text = text
    a = []
    while char in new_text:
        a.append(new_text.index(char))
        new_text = new_text.replace(char,"",1)
    return a
<Code>

What would be the return value of`f('rvr', 'r')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two inputs: a string `text` and a character `char`. It returns a list of integers.

The function works by iteratively searching for the character `char` in the string `text`. If `char` is found in `text`, the index of `char` in `text` is appended to the list `a`, and `char` is replaced with an empty string in `text`. This process continues until `char` is no longer found in `text`.

The function then returns the list `a`, which contains the indices of all occurrences of `char` in `text`.

For the input `('rvr', 'r')`, the function is searching for the character 'r' in the string 'rvr'. The character 'r' is found at index 0 and 2 in 'rvr', so the function returns the list `[0, 2]`.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `('rvr', 'r')` is `[0, 2]`.

<<<Output>>>
[0, 2]
