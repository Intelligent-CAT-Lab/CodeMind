### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(list_, num):
    temp = []
    for i in list_:
        i = num // 2 * ('%s,' % i)
        temp.append(i)
    return temp
<Code>

What would be the return value of`f(['v'], 1)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes a list and a number as input. It creates an empty list `temp` and then iterates over each element in the input list. For each element, it divides the number by 2 and multiplies the element by the result. The result is then formatted as a string and appended to the `temp` list. Finally, the function returns the `temp` list.

To determine the output of executing the function `f` on the input `['v']` and `1`, we need to follow the steps of the function.

In the first iteration, the element 'v' is divided by 2 and multiplied by the result. The result is then formatted as a string and appended to the `temp` list.

Therefore, the output of executing the function `f` on the input `['v']` and `1` is `['']`.

<<<Output>>>
`['']`
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
