### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
    return s + "a"
</Code>
What would be the return value of `f("hi")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The function f takes a string s as input and returns the concatenation of s with the string "a".
To determine the output of executing the function f on the input "hi", we need to concatenate "hi" with "a".
Therefore, the output of executing the function f on the input "hi" is "hia".
<<<Output>>>
'hia'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(text, strip_chars):
    return text[::-1].strip(strip_chars)[::-1]
<Code>

What would be the return value of`f('tcmfsmj', 'cfj')`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `f` takes two parameters: `text` and `strip_chars`. 

The `text` parameter is a string that we want to reverse and strip some characters from the ends. 

The `strip_chars` parameter is a string containing the characters we want to strip from the `text` string.

The function first reverses the `text` string using slicing with a step of -1 (`text[::-1]`). This results in a new string where the characters are in reverse order.

Then it strips the `strip_chars` characters from the ends of the reversed `text` string using the `strip` method (`text[::-1].strip(strip_chars)`). The `strip` method removes the specified characters from the beginning and end of the string.

Finally, it reverses the stripped string back to its original order (`text[::-1].strip(strip_chars)[::-1]`).

So, if we call `f('tcmfsmj', 'cfj')`, the output will be the reversed and stripped string.

<<<Output>>>
'jmsmftc'
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

This is because the reversed string of 'tcmfsmj' is 'jmsmftc', and the stripped string of 'jmsmftc' with characters 'c' and 'f' from the ends is 'jmsmft'. The reversed string of 'jmsmft' is 'ftsmjm'.
