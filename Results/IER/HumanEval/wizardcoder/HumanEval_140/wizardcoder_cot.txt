Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def fix_spaces(text):
    new_text = ""
    i = 0
    start, end = 0, 0
    while i < len(text):
        if text[i] == " ":
            end += 1
        else:
            if end - start > 2:
                new_text += "-"+text[i]
            elif end - start > 0:
                new_text += "_"*(end - start)+text[i]
            else:
                new_text += text[i]
            start, end = i+1, i+1
        i+=1
    if end - start > 2:
        new_text += "-"
    elif end - start > 0:
        new_text += "_"
    return new_text

<Code>

What would be the return value of `fix_spaces("Example") `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to "Example".
The variable new_text is initialized to "", which will be used to accumulate the modified text.
The variables i, start and end are initialized to 0, 0 and 0, respectively.
The code enters a while loop that iterates over each character in the input text.
If the current character is a space, it updates the end index to include the current space.
If the current character is not a space, it checks if there are more than 2 consecutive spaces. If so, it adds a hyphen and the current character to new_text. If there are 2 or 1 consecutive spaces, it adds an underscore and the current character to new_text. If there are no consecutive spaces, it adds the current character to new_text. It also updates the start and end indices to include the current character.
After the loop finishes, it checks if there are any remaining spaces at the end of the input text. If so, it adds a hyphen or an underscore to new_text, depending on the number of consecutive spaces.
Finally, the code returns the modified text.
<<<Output>>>
