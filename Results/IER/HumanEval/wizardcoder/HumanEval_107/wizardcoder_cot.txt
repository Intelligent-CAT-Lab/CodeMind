Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    def is_palindrome(n):
        return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]

    even_palindrome_count = 0
    odd_palindrome_count = 0

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i%2 == 1 and is_palindrome(i):
                odd_palindrome_count += 1
        elif i%2 == 0 and is_palindrome(i):
            even_palindrome_count += 1
    return (even_palindrome_count, odd_palindrome_count)

<Code>

What would be the return value of `even_odd_palindrome(123) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 123.
The function is_palindrome(n) is defined to check if a number is a palindrome or not. It returns True if the number is a palindrome, and False otherwise.
The variables even_palindrome_count and odd_palindrome_count are initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of even and odd palindromes, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 123.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is odd or even, and if it is a palindrome. If it is, it increments the corresponding counter.
After the loop finishes, the code returns a tuple containing the values of even_palindrome_count and odd_palindrome_count.
<<<Output>>>
(10, 12)
