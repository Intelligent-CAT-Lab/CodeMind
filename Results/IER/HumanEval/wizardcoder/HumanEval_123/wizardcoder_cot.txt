Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    if n%2==0:
        odd_collatz = [] 
    else:
        odd_collatz = [n]
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n/2
        else:
            n = n*3 + 1
            
        if n%2 == 1:
            odd_collatz.append(int(n))

    return sorted(odd_collatz)

<Code>

What would be the return value of `get_odd_collatz(14) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 14.
The code checks if n is even or odd. If it is even, it initializes the list odd_collatz to an empty list. If it is odd, it initializes the list odd_collatz to a list containing only n.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until n is equal to 1.
Inside the while loop, the code checks if n is even or odd. If it is even, it divides n by 2. If it is odd, it multiplies n by 3 and adds 1.
The code then checks if n is odd. If it is, it appends n to the list odd_collatz.
After the while loop finishes, the code returns the sorted list odd_collatz.
<<<Output>>>
[13, 40, 29]
