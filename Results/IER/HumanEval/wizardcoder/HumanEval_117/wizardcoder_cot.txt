Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def select_words(s, n):
    result = []
    for word in s.split():
        n_consonants = 0
        for i in range(0, len(word)):
            if word[i].lower() not in ["a","e","i","o","u"]:
                n_consonants += 1 
        if n_consonants == n:
            result.append(word)
    return result


<Code>

What would be the return value of `select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to "Mary had a little lamb", and variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable result is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the selected words.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each word in the string s, which is separated by spaces.
For each word, the code initializes a variable n_consonants to 0, which will be used to count the number of consonants in the word.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over each character in the word.
For each character, the code checks if it is a consonant (i.e., not a vowel) and increments n_consonants if it is.
After the inner loop finishes, the code checks if n_consonants is equal to n. If it is, the word is added to the result list.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of result, which is ["Mary", "little"].
<<<Output>>>
["Mary", "little"]
