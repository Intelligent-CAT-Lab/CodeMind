Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    ret = set()
    for e1 in l1:
        for e2 in l2:
            if e1 == e2:
                ret.add(e1)
    return sorted(list(ret))

<Code>

What would be the return value of `common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `common` takes two lists as input, `l1` and `l2`.
The function creates an empty set `ret` to store the common elements.
The function then iterates over each element `e1` in `l1` and iterates over each element `e2` in `l2`.
If `e1` is equal to `e2`, it adds `e1` to `ret`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns a sorted list of the elements in `ret`.

The input lists are `[1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5]` and `[5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]`, respectively.

The first loop iterates over each element `e1` in `[1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5]`, which are 1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, and 5, respectively.
The second loop iterates over each element `e2` in `[5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]`, which are 5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, and 121, respectively.

For each pair of elements `(e1, e2)`, if `e1` is equal to `e2`, it adds `e1` to `ret`, which is initially empty.
After the first loop, `ret` contains the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 653.
After the second loop, `ret` contains the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 653, and 121.

The function returns a sorted list of the elements in `ret`, which is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 653, 121]`.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 653, 121]
