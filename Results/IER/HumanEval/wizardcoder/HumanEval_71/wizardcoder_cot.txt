Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2    
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
    area = round(area, 2)
    return area

<Code>

What would be the return value of `triangle_area(3, 4, 5) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 3, 4 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is less than or equal to the third side. If it is, the code returns -1 as the area cannot be calculated.
If the condition is not met, the code calculates the semi-perimeter of the triangle, which is the sum of its three sides divided by 2.
The code then calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula, which is the square root of the product of the semi-perimeter and the difference between the semi-perimeter and any of the sides.
The area is rounded to two decimal places and returned as the output.
<<<Output>>>
6.0
