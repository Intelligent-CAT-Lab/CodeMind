Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    odd_count = 0
    for digit in str(n):
        int_digit = int(digit)
        if int_digit%2 == 1:
            product= product*int_digit
            odd_count+=1
    if odd_count ==0:
        return 0
    else:
        return product

<Code>

What would be the return value of `digits(5) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each digit of the number n.
For each digit, it converts it to an integer and checks if it is odd or even. If it is odd, it multiplies it with the current value of product and increments the odd_count.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if odd_count is 0. If it is, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the product.
The value of product is initially set to 1 and odd_count is initially set to 0.
For n=5, the loop iterates over the digits 5, 5, 5, 5, 5. Since all of them are even, the loop does not execute and the code returns 0.
<<<Output>>>0
