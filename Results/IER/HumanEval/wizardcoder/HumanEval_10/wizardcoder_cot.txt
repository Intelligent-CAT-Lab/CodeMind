Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    if not string:
        return ''

    beginning_of_suffix = 0

    while not is_palindrome(string[beginning_of_suffix:]):
        beginning_of_suffix += 1

    return string + string[:beginning_of_suffix][::-1]

<Code>

What would be the return value of `is_palindrome('jerry') `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable string is initialized to 'jerry'.
The function is_palindrome is defined with a string parameter and a boolean return type.
The function checks if the string is empty. If it is, it returns an empty string.
The function then initializes a variable beginning_of_suffix to 0, which will be used to find the beginning of the suffix that is a palindrome.
The function enters a while loop that continues until the suffix of the string starting from beginning_of_suffix is not a palindrome.
Inside the while loop, the function increments beginning_of_suffix by 1 and checks if the suffix is a palindrome.
If the suffix is not a palindrome, the function continues the while loop.
If the suffix is a palindrome, the function returns the concatenation of the original string and the reversed suffix of the string starting from beginning_of_suffix.
<<<Output>>>
'jerryjerry'[::-1]
