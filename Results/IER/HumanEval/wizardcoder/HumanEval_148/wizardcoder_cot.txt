Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planet_names = ("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune")
    if planet1 not in planet_names or planet2 not in planet_names or planet1 == planet2:
        return ()
    planet1_index = planet_names.index(planet1)
    planet2_index = planet_names.index(planet2)
    if planet1_index < planet2_index:
        return (planet_names[planet1_index + 1: planet2_index])
    else:
        return (planet_names[planet2_index + 1 : planet1_index])

<Code>

What would be the return value of `bf("Jupiter", "Neptune") `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function bf takes two arguments, planet1 and planet2.
The planet_names tuple contains the names of all the planets in order.
The function checks if planet1 and planet2 are valid planets by checking if they are in the planet_names tuple and if they are not the same planet.
If planet1 and planet2 are valid, the function calculates the index of planet1 and planet2 in the planet_names tuple.
If planet1_index is less than planet2_index, the function returns a tuple containing the names of all the planets between planet1 and planet2, inclusive.
If planet1_index is greater than planet2_index, the function returns a tuple containing the names of all the planets between planet2 and planet1, inclusive.
If planet1 and planet2 are not valid, the function returns an empty tuple.
<<<Output>>>
("Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune")
