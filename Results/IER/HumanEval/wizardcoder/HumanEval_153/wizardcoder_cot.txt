Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strong = extensions[0]
    my_val = len([x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.isupper()]) - len([x for x in extensions[0] if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])
    for s in extensions:
        val = len([x for x in s if x.isalpha() and x.isupper()]) - len([x for x in s if x.isalpha() and x.islower()])
        if val > my_val:
            strong = s
            my_val = val

    ans = class_name + "." + strong
    return ans


<Code>

What would be the return value of `Strongest_Extension('Watashi', ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe']) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable class_name is initialized to 'Watashi', and variable extensions is initialized to ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe'].
The variable strong is initialized to the first element of the list extensions, which is 'tEN'.
The variable my_val is initialized to the length of uppercase letters minus the length of lowercase letters in the first element of the list extensions, which is 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the remaining elements of the list extensions.
For each element s in the list, it calculates the length of uppercase letters minus the length of lowercase letters in s and stores it in val.
If val is greater than my_val, it updates the value of strong to s and my_val to val.
After the loop finishes, the code constructs the final answer by concatenating class_name and strong with a dot in between, and returns it.
<<<Output>>>
Watashi.eIGHt8OKe
