Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def match_parens(lst):
    def check(s):
        val = 0
        for i in s:
            if i == '(':
                val = val + 1
            else:
                val = val - 1
            if val < 0:
                return False
        return True if val == 0 else False

    S1 = lst[0] + lst[1]
    S2 = lst[1] + lst[0]
    return 'Yes' if check(S1) or check(S2) else 'No'

<Code>

What would be the return value of `match_parens(['()(', ')']) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function match_parens takes a list of strings as input.
The function defines a nested function check that takes a string as input.
The check function iterates over each character in the string and checks if it is a left parenthesis or a right parenthesis. If it encounters a left parenthesis, it increments a counter, and if it encounters a right parenthesis, it decrements the counter. If the counter ever becomes negative, the function returns False. If the counter is zero at the end of the iteration, the function returns True.
The function then creates two new strings by concatenating the first two elements of the input list.
The function checks if either of these new strings can be matched by calling the check function on each of them.
If either of these checks returns True, the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
'Yes'
