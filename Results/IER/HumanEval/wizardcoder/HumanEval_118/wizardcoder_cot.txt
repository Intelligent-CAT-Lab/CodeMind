Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    if len(word) < 3:
        return ""

    vowels = {"a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "A", "E", 'O', 'U', 'I'}
    for i in range(len(word)-2, 0, -1):
        if word[i] in vowels:
            if (word[i+1] not in vowels) and (word[i-1] not in vowels):
                return word[i]
    return ""

<Code>

What would be the return value of `get_closest_vowel("yogurt") `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable word is initialized to "yogurt".
The code checks if the length of the word is less than 3. If it is, it returns an empty string.
The code initializes a set vowels with all the vowels in lowercase and uppercase.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the second last character of the word to the first character.
For each character i in this range, it checks if it is a vowel. If it is, it checks if the next character is not a vowel and the previous character is not a vowel. If both conditions are met, it returns the current vowel.
After the loop finishes, the code returns an empty string, since there is no vowel in the word that meets the condition.
<<<Output>>>
"u"
