Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def histogram(test):
    dict1={}
    list1=test.split(" ")
    t=0

    for i in list1:
        if(list1.count(i)>t) and i!='':
            t=list1.count(i)
    if t>0:
        for i in list1:
            if(list1.count(i)==t):
                
                dict1[i]=t
    return dict1

<Code>

What would be the return value of `histogram('a b b a') `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable test is initialized to 'a b b a'.
The code splits the string 'a b b a' into a list of words 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a'.
The variable t is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the maximum frequency of a word in the list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list of words.
For each word i in the list, it checks if the frequency of i in the list is greater than t. If it is, it updates the value of t to the frequency of i.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates over the list of words again.
For each word i in the list, it checks if the frequency of i in the list is equal to t. If it is, it adds the word and its frequency to a dictionary dict1.
After the second loop finishes, the code returns the final dictionary dict1, which contains the words and their frequencies.
<<<Output>>>
{'a': 2, 'b': 2}
