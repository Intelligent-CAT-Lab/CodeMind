Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    l1 = 0
    for st in lst1:
        l1 += len(st)
    
    l2 = 0
    for st in lst2:
        l2 += len(st)
    
    if l1 <= l2:
        return lst1
    else:
        return lst2

<Code>

What would be the return value of `total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi']) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `total_match` takes two lists as input, `lst1` and `lst2`.

The function initializes two variables `l1` and `l2` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total length of the strings in `lst1` and `lst2`, respectively.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over each string `st` in `lst1`. For each string, it adds the length of the string to `l1`.

The function then enters another loop that iterates over each string `st` in `lst2`. For each string, it adds the length of the string to `l2`.

The function then checks if `l1` is less than or equal to `l2`. If it is, it returns `lst1`. Otherwise, it returns `lst2`.

The function is called with the input `['hi', 'admin']` and `['hi', 'hi']`, which are two lists of strings.

The function first initializes `l1` and `l2` to 0.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over each string `st` in `['hi', 'admin']`. For each string, it adds the length of the string to `l1`, which is 3 and 6, respectively.

The function then enters another loop that iterates over each string `st` in `['hi', 'hi']`. For each string, it adds the length of the string to `l2`, which is 2 and 2, respectively.

The function then checks if `l1` is less than or equal to `l2`. Since `l1` is 3 and `l2` is 2, `l1 <= l2` is True. Therefore, the function returns `lst1`, which is `['hi', 'admin']`.

<<<Output>>>
['hi', 'admin']
