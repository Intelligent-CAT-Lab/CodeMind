Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sort_even(l: list):
    evens = l[::2]
    odds = l[1::2]
    evens.sort()
    ans = []
    for e, o in zip(evens, odds):
        ans.extend([e, o])
    if len(evens) > len(odds):
        ans.append(evens[-1])
    return ans

<Code>

What would be the return value of `tuple(sort_even([1, 2, 3])) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable l is initialized to [1, 2, 3].
The code creates two new lists, evens and odds, by slicing the original list l with a step of 2. This means that the first element of the new list will be the first element of l, the second element will be the third element of l, and so on.
The code then sorts the even elements of the list evens using the sort() method.
The code then creates a new list, ans, by concatenating the sorted even elements of evens with the odd elements of l.
If the length of evens is greater than the length of odds, the code appends the last element of evens to the end of ans.
The code then returns the final value of ans, which is [2, 1, 3].
<<<Output>>>
(2, 1, 3)
