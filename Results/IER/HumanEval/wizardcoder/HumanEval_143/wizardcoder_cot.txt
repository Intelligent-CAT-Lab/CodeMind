Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    new_lst = []
    for word in sentence.split():
        flg = 0
        if len(word) == 1:
            flg = 1
        for i in range(2, len(word)):
            if len(word)%i == 0:
                flg = 1
        if flg == 0 or len(word) == 2:
            new_lst.append(word)
    return " ".join(new_lst)

<Code>

What would be the return value of `words_in_sentence("This is a test") `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable sentence is initialized to "This is a test".
The variable new_lst is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each word in the sentence.
For each word, it checks if its length is 1 or not. If it is, it sets the flag flg to 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the range [2, len(word)-1].
For each value of i in this range, it checks if len(word) is divisible by i or not. If it is, it sets the flag flg to 1.
If the flag flg is still 0 after the loop, it means that the word is not a prime number or a palindrome, so it is added to the new_lst.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of new_lst, which is "This is a".
<<<Output>>>
"This is a"
