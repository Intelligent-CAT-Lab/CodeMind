Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the return value of the code.
Below is an example:
Consider the following code:

[[[Example Start]]]
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

[[[Example End]]]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def prime_fib(n: int):
    import math

    def is_prime(p):
        if p < 2:
            return False
        for k in range(2, min(int(math.sqrt(p)) + 1, p - 1)):
            if p % k == 0:
                return False
        return True
    f = [0, 1]
    while True:
        f.append(f[-1] + f[-2])
        if is_prime(f[-1]):
            n -= 1
        if n == 0:
            return f[-1]

<Code>

What would be the return value of `prime_fib(1) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 1.
The function is_prime is defined to check if a number is prime or not. It takes a number as input and returns True if it is prime, False otherwise.
The function prime_fib is defined to generate the nth prime number in the Fibonacci sequence. It takes an integer n as input and returns the nth prime number in the Fibonacci sequence.
The function initializes the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence as 0 and 1, respectively.
The function enters a loop that generates the next number in the Fibonacci sequence by adding the previous two numbers.
The function checks if the current number is prime using the is_prime function.
If the current number is prime, the variable n is decremented by 1.
If n reaches 0, the function returns the current number as the nth prime number in the Fibonacci sequence.
<<<Output>>>
13
