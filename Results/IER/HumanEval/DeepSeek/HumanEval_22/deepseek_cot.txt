### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]

<Code>

What would be the return value of `filter_integers([3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b']) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_integers` takes a list of values as input. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the elements of the input list that are integers.

The list comprehension iterates over each element `x` in the input list. For each element, it checks if `x` is an instance of the `int` class using the `isinstance` function. If `x` is an integer, it is included in the new list. If `x` is not an integer, it is not included in the new list.

The function returns the new list of integers.

The input list `[3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b']` contains integers 3, 3, and 3, as well as other types of values that are not integers.

The output of the function would be a list containing only the integers from the input list: `[3, 3, 3]`.

<<<Output>>>
[3, 3, 3]
