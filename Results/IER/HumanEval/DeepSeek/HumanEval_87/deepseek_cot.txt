### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_row(lst, x):
    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(sorted(coords, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True), key=lambda x: x[0])

<Code>

What would be the return value of `get_row([], 1) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code defines a function `get_row(lst, x)`. The function takes a 2D list `lst` and a number `x` as input. It finds all the coordinates of `x` in `lst` and returns them in a sorted manner.

The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of tuples `coords`. Each tuple represents a coordinate in the form of `(i, j)`, where `i` is the row index and `j` is the column index of `x` in `lst`. The list comprehension iterates over each element in `lst`, and for each element, it iterates over its elements. If the element is equal to `x`, it adds the coordinate to `coords`.

After generating `coords`, the function sorts `coords` first by the second element of each tuple (i.e., the column index), in descending order. Then it sorts `coords` again by the first element of each tuple (i.e., the row index), in ascending order.

The function finally returns the sorted `coords`.

Now, let's consider the input `get_row([], 1)`. As the input list `lst` is empty, there are no elements to search for `x`. Therefore, the function will return an empty list.
