### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))

<Code>

What would be the return value of `sort_array([1,5,2,3,4]) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_array(arr)` takes an array of integers as input. The array is sorted first by its natural order, which means it is sorted in ascending order. Then, the array is sorted again by the number of '1's in the binary representation of each number. The binary representation of a number is obtained by using the `bin()` function in Python, which converts the number into a binary string. The `count('1')` function counts the number of '1's in this string.

For example, if the input array is [1,5,2,3,4], the binary representation of each number is:
- 1: '1'
- 5: '101'
- 2: '10'
- 3: '11'
- 4: '100'

The number of '1's in these binary representations are:
- 1: 1
- 5: 2
- 2: 1
- 3: 2
- 4: 1

So, the array is sorted first by its natural order, which gives [1,2,3,4,5]. Then, the array is sorted again by the number of '1's in the binary representation, which gives [1,2,4,3,5].

<<<Output>>>
[1,2,4,3,5]
