### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def count_nums(arr):
    def digits_sum(n):
        neg = 1
        if n < 0: n, neg = -1 * n, -1 
        n = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
        n[0] = n[0] * neg
        return sum(n)
    return len(list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, [digits_sum(i) for i in arr])))

<Code>

What would be the return value of `count_nums([1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5]) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_nums` takes a list of integers as input and returns the count of numbers in the list for which the sum of digits is greater than 0.

The inner function `digits_sum` calculates the sum of the digits of a number. If the number is negative, it multiplies the first digit by -1 to preserve the sign.

The function `count_nums` then maps the `digits_sum` function to each element of the input list, filters out the negative sums, and returns the length of the resulting list.

For the input `[1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5]`, the `digits_sum` function is applied to each element, resulting in `[1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5]`. The negative sums are filtered out, leaving `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5]`. The length of this list is 5, so the function `count_nums` returns 5.

<<<Output>>>
5
