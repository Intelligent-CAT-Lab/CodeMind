### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def valid_date(date):
    try:
        date = date.strip()
        month, day, year = date.split('-')
        month, day, year = int(month), int(day), int(year)
        if month < 1 or month > 12:
            return False
        if month in [1,3,5,7,8,10,12] and day < 1 or day > 31:
            return False
        if month in [4,6,9,11] and day < 1 or day > 30:
            return False
        if month == 2 and day < 1 or day > 29:
            return False
    except:
        return False

    return True

<Code>

What would be the return value of `valid_date('03-11-2000') `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `valid_date(date)` takes a string argument `date` in the format 'MM-DD-YYYY'. The function tries to validate this date.

1. The function first strips the input date string to remove any leading or trailing spaces.
2. Then, it splits the date string into three parts: month, day, and year using the hyphen as a delimiter.
3. It converts the month and day parts to integers.
4. It checks if the month is between 1 and 12. If not, it returns `False`.
5. It checks if the day is valid for the given month. For months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December), the day should be between 1 and 31. For months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November), the day should be between 1 and 30. For February, the day should be between 1 and 29. If the day is not valid, it returns `False`.
6. If the function has not returned `False` by the time it has processed all the checks, it returns `True`, indicating that the date is valid.
7. If any error occurs during the execution of the function, it catches the exception and returns `False`.

<<<Output>>>
The output of `valid_date('03-11-2000')` would be `True`, indicating that the date '03-11-2000' is valid.
