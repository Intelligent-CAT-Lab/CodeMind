### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_squares(lst):
    result =[]
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i %3 == 0:
            result.append(lst[i]**2)
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i%3 != 0:
            result.append(lst[i]**3)
        else:
            result.append(lst[i])
    return sum(result)

<Code>

What would be the return value of `sum_squares([1,2,3]) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_squares` takes a list of integers as input. The list is named `lst`. The function iterates over the indices of the list. The index `i` is used to determine what to do with the element at that index in the list.

If the index `i` is divisible by 3 (i.e., `i % 3 == 0`), the function squares the element at that index and appends the square to the `result` list.

If the index `i` is divisible by 4 but not by 3 (i.e., `i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0`), the function cubes the element at that index and appends the cube to the `result` list.

If neither of the above conditions is met, the function simply appends the element at that index to the `result` list.

Finally, the function returns the sum of all elements in the `result` list.

In the given example `sum_squares([1,2,3])`, the function will square the element at index 0 (which is 1) and append it to the `result` list. It will append the element at index 1 (which is 2) to the `result` list because 1 is not divisible by 3 or 4. It will cube the element at index 2 (which is 3) and append it to the `result` list. The sum of the elements in the `result` list is 1 + 2 + 27 = 30.

<<<Output>>>
30
