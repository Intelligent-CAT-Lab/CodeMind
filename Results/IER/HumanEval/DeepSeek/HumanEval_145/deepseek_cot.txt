### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

<<<Output>>>

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def order_by_points(nums):
    def digits_sum(n):
        neg = 1
        if n < 0: n, neg = -1 * n, -1 
        n = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
        n[0] = n[0] * neg
        return sum(n)
    return sorted(nums, key=digits_sum)

<Code>

What would be the return value of `order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `order_by_points` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where the integers are sorted based on the sum of their digits. The helper function `digits_sum` calculates the sum of the digits of a number.

In the `order_by_points` function, the `sorted` function is used to sort the input list `nums`. The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is set to `digits_sum`, which means that the `digits_sum` function will be used to determine the sort order of the elements in `nums`.

The `digits_sum` function first checks if the input number is negative. If it is, it negates the number and stores the sign in the variable `neg`. Then it converts the number to a list of its digits. The first digit is multiplied by `neg` to restore the sign of the number. Finally, it returns the sum of the digits.

In the `order_by_points` function, the `sorted` function returns a new list where the elements are sorted based on the sum of their digits.

For the input `[1, 11, -1, -11, -12]`, the output of the `digits_sum` function for each number is `[1, 2, -1, -2, -3]`. Since the sum of the digits is negative, the sign of the number is also negative. Therefore, the `digits_sum` function returns `[-1, -2, 1, 2, -3]`.

The `sorted` function then sorts the list based on these sums. Since the sums are negative, the elements are sorted in descending order. Therefore, the output of the `order_by_points` function for the input `[1, 11, -1, -11, -12]` is `[-1, 1, -11, 11, -12]`.

<<<Output>>>
`[-1, 1, -11, 11, -12]`
