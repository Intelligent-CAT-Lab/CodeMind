### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def numerical_letter_grade(grades):

   
    letter_grade = []
    for gpa in grades:
        if gpa == 4.0:
            letter_grade.append("A+")
        elif gpa > 3.7:
            letter_grade.append("A")
        elif gpa > 3.3:
            letter_grade.append("A-")
        elif gpa > 3.0:
            letter_grade.append("B+")
        elif gpa > 2.7:
            letter_grade.append("B")
        elif gpa > 2.3:
            letter_grade.append("B-")
        elif gpa > 2.0:
            letter_grade.append("C+")
        elif gpa > 1.7:
            letter_grade.append("C")
        elif gpa > 1.3:
            letter_grade.append("C-")
        elif gpa > 1.0:
            letter_grade.append("D+")
        elif gpa > 0.7:
            letter_grade.append("D")
        elif gpa > 0.0:
            letter_grade.append("D-")
        else:
            letter_grade.append("E")
    return letter_grade

<Code>

What would be the return value of `numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `numerical_letter_grade` takes a list of GPA (Grade Point Average) as input. For each GPA in the list, it checks the range of the GPA and assigns a letter grade to it. The ranges are as follows:

- A+: 4.0
- A: 3.7 - 4.0
- A-: 3.3 - 3.7
- B+: 3.0 - 3.3
- B: 2.7 - 3.0
- B-: 2.3 - 2.7
- C+: 2.0 - 2.3
- C: 1.7 - 2.0
- C-: 1.3 - 1.7
- D+: 1.0 - 1.3
- D: 0.7 - 1.0
- D-: 0.0 - 0.7
- E: Below 0.0

The function iterates over each GPA in the input list, checks the range of the GPA and appends the corresponding letter grade to the `letter_grade` list.

Finally, the function returns the `letter_grade` list.

<<<Output>>>
The output of `numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5])` would be `['A+', 'A', 'C', 'B+', 'B+']`.
