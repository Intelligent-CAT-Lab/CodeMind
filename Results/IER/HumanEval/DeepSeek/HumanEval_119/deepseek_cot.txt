### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def match_parens(lst):
    def check(s):
        val = 0
        for i in s:
            if i == '(':
                val = val + 1
            else:
                val = val - 1
            if val < 0:
                return False
        return True if val == 0 else False

    S1 = lst[0] + lst[1]
    S2 = lst[1] + lst[0]
    return 'Yes' if check(S1) or check(S2) else 'No'

<Code>

What would be the return value of `match_parens(['()(', ')']) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `match_parens` takes a list of two strings as input. The strings are supposed to represent parentheses expressions. The function checks if the parentheses in the strings are balanced.

The inner function `check` takes a string as input and checks if the parentheses in the string are balanced. It does this by iterating over the string and for each character, it increments a counter if the character is '(' and decrements the counter if the character is ')'. If at any point the counter goes negative, the function returns False, indicating that the parentheses are not balanced. If the counter is 0 at the end of the string, the function returns True, indicating that the parentheses are balanced.

The function `match_parens` then concatenates the two strings in the list and checks if the parentheses are balanced in the resulting string. If they are, it returns 'Yes'. If they are not, it returns 'No'.

For the input `['()(', ')']`, the function concatenates the two strings to get `()()`. The function then checks if the parentheses are balanced in this string. Since the parentheses are not balanced, the function returns 'No'.

<<<Output>>>
'No'
