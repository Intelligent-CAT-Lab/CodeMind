### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_nested(string):
    opening_bracket_index = []
    closing_bracket_index = []
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] == '[':
            opening_bracket_index.append(i)
        else:
            closing_bracket_index.append(i)
    closing_bracket_index.reverse()
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    l = len(closing_bracket_index)
    for idx in opening_bracket_index:
        if i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]:
            cnt += 1
            i += 1
    return cnt >= 2

    

<Code>

What would be the return value of `is_nested('[[]]') `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_nested` takes a string as input. The string contains brackets, which can be either opening or closing brackets. The function checks if the brackets in the string are properly nested.

The function initializes two empty lists: `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index`. It then iterates over the input string. If it encounters an opening bracket, it adds the index of that bracket to `opening_bracket_index`. If it encounters a closing bracket, it adds the index of that bracket to `closing_bracket_index`.

After the loop, it reverses `closing_bracket_index` so that it is in the correct order.

The function then initializes two variables: `cnt` (count) and `i`. `cnt` is used to count the number of properly nested brackets, and `i` is used to iterate over `closing_bracket_index`.

The function then iterates over `opening_bracket_index`. For each index in `opening_bracket_index`, it checks if the index is less than the `i`th element of `closing_bracket_index`. If it is, it increments `cnt` and `i`.

Finally, the function returns whether `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. This means that there are at least two properly nested brackets in the string.

<<<Output>>>
The output of `is_nested('[[]]')` would be `True`.

This is because the string `[[]]` contains two properly nested brackets: one opening bracket at index 0, and one closing bracket at index 3. The opening bracket is at a lower index than the closing bracket, which means that the brackets are properly nested. Therefore, the function returns `True`.
