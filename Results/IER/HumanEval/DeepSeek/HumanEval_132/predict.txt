The output of `is_nested('[[]]')` would be `True`.

This is because the string `[[]]` contains two properly nested brackets: one opening bracket at index 0, and one closing bracket at index 3. The opening bracket is at a lower index than the closing bracket, which means that the brackets are properly nested. Therefore, the function returns `True`.
