### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    ret = set()
    for e1 in l1:
        for e2 in l2:
            if e1 == e2:
                ret.add(e1)
    return sorted(list(ret))

<Code>

What would be the return value of `common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `common` takes two lists as input. The first list is `l1` and the second list is `l2`. The function is intended to find the common elements between these two lists.

The function starts by creating an empty set `ret`. A set is a data structure that does not allow duplicate elements. This is used to store the common elements between the two lists.

The function then enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over each element `e1` in `l1`. For each `e1`, the inner loop iterates over each element `e2` in `l2`.

For each pair of elements `(e1, e2)`, the function checks if `e1` is equal to `e2`. If they are equal, the function adds `e1` to the set `ret`.

After the loops finish, the function converts the set `ret` back to a list and sorts it. The sorted list is then returned as the output of the function.

The input to the function is `[1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5]` and `[5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]`.

The common elements between these two lists are 1, 5, and 653. So, the output of the function should be `[1, 5, 653]`.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 653]
