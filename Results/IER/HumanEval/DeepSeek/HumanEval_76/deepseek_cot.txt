### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    if (n == 1): 
        return (x == 1) 
    power = 1
    while (power < x): 
        power = power * n 
    return (power == x) 

<Code>

What would be the return value of `is_simple_power(16, 2)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_simple_power(x, n)` takes two parameters: `x` and `n`. `x` is the number we want to check if it is a power of `n`, and `n` is the base of the power.

The function starts by checking if `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, it checks if `x` is 1. If `x` is 1, it returns True, because 1 is a power of any number (except 0).

If `n` is not 1, the function initializes a variable `power` to 1. This variable will be used to store the result of `n` raised to the power of `i`, where `i` is a counter.

The function then enters a while loop. The loop continues as long as `power` is less than `x`. Inside the loop, `power` is multiplied by `n`, which increases `power` by `n` for each iteration.

After the loop finishes, the function checks if `power` is equal to `x`. If `power` is equal to `x`, it means `x` is a power of `n`, so the function returns True. If `power` is not equal to `x`, it means `x` is not a power of `n`, so the function returns False.

So, for the input `is_simple_power(16, 2)`, the function checks if 16 is a power of 2. 

The function calculates 2 raised to the power of 4 (2^4 = 16), which is equal to the input number 16. Therefore, the function returns True, indicating that 16 is a power of 2.

<<<Output>>>
True
