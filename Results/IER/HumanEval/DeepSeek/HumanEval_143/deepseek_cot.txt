### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    new_lst = []
    for word in sentence.split():
        flg = 0
        if len(word) == 1:
            flg = 1
        for i in range(2, len(word)):
            if len(word)%i == 0:
                flg = 1
        if flg == 0 or len(word) == 2:
            new_lst.append(word)
    return " ".join(new_lst)

<Code>

What would be the return value of `words_in_sentence("This is a test") `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `words_in_sentence(sentence)` takes a string `sentence` as input. The string is split into words using the `split()` function, which separates the string into words based on spaces.

For each word in the sentence, the code checks if the length of the word is 1 or if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself. If the word meets either of these conditions, it is not added to the new list `new_lst`.

If the length of the word is not 1 and cannot be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself, or if the length of the word is 2, the word is added to `new_lst`.

Finally, the function joins the words in `new_lst` back into a string with spaces in between and returns this string.

<<<Output>>>
"This is a test"
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

The output of the code is the original sentence "This is a test" because none of the words meet the conditions to be removed.
