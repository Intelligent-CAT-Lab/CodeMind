### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    current_string = []
    current_depth = 0

    for c in paren_string:
        if c == '(':
            current_depth += 1
            current_string.append(c)
        elif c == ')':
            current_depth -= 1
            current_string.append(c)

            if current_depth == 0:
                result.append(''.join(current_string))
                current_string.clear()

    return result

<Code>

What would be the return value of `separate_paren_groups('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())') `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `separate_paren_groups` takes a string `paren_string` as input. This string contains parentheses characters. The function is supposed to separate the parentheses groups in the string.

The function initializes an empty list `result` to store the separated parentheses groups. It also initializes an empty list `current_string` to store the current parentheses group. The variable `current_depth` is used to track the depth of the parentheses.

The function then iterates over each character `c` in the input string. If `c` is an opening parenthesis `(`, it increments `current_depth` and appends `c` to `current_string`. If `c` is a closing parenthesis `)`, it decrements `current_depth` and appends `c` to `current_string`.

If `current_depth` becomes 0, it means a parentheses group has been completed. The function then appends the current group to `result`, clears `current_string` for the next group, and continues to the next character.

Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the separated parentheses groups.

<<<Output>>>
The output of `separate_paren_groups('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')` would be:
['()', '(())', '((()))', '()', '((())()())']
