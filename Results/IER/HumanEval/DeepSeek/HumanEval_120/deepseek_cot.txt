### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def maximum(arr, k):
    if k == 0:
        return []
    arr.sort()
    ans = arr[-k:]
    return ans

<Code>

What would be the return value of `maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `maximum(arr, k)` takes in a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`.

The first step is to check if `k` is 0. If it is, the function returns an empty list. This is because you can't get the maximum of 0 numbers from a list.

Next, the function sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. This is done using the built-in `sort()` function in Python.

Then, it takes the last `k` elements from the sorted list `arr` and stores them in the variable `ans`. This is done using Python's list slicing feature. The `-k` index means "start from the end of the list and go back `k` steps".

Finally, the function returns `ans`.

<<<Output>>>
The output of `maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3)` would be `[5]`.

This is because the list `[-3, -4, 5]` is sorted in ascending order to get `[-4, -3, 5]`. The last 3 elements of this sorted list are `[5]`.
