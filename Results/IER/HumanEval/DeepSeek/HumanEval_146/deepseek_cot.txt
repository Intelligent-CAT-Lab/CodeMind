### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def specialFilter(nums):
    
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
            number_as_string = str(num)
            if int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits:
                count += 1
        
    return count 

<Code>

What would be the return value of `specialFilter([5, -2, 1, -5]) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function specialFilter takes a list of integers as input. The list is iterated over, and for each number in the list, the following steps are performed:

1. The number is checked if it is greater than 10. If it is not, the number is skipped and the next number is processed.
2. If the number is greater than 10, it is converted to a string. The first and last characters of the string are checked if they are odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9).
3. If both the first and last characters are odd digits, the count is incremented by 1.
4. The process is repeated for all numbers in the list.

After all numbers have been processed, the function returns the count.

In the given example, the list [5, -2, 1, -5] is passed to the function. The number 5 is greater than 10, so it is converted to a string. The first character '5' is an odd digit and the last character '5' is also an odd digit. So, the count is incremented by 1. The number -2 is not greater than 10, so it is skipped. The number 1 is greater than 10, but the first character '1' is not an odd digit and the last character '1' is not an odd digit. So, the count remains 1. The number -5 is not greater than 10, so it is skipped.

So, the final count is 1.

<<<Output>>>
1
