I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The code you provided is not complete and it seems like there's a typo in the function name. I'll assume you meant `poly` for the function name.

The function `poly(xs: list, x: float)` takes a list of coefficients `xs` and a point `x`, and returns the value of the polynomial at `x`. The coefficients are in the list `xs` in decreasing order of degree. For example, if `xs = [1, 2, 3]`, then the polynomial is `x^2 + 2x + 3`.

The function `find_zero(6)` is not defined in the provided code. It seems like you might be trying to find the roots of a polynomial, but the function `find_zero` is not defined.

Could you please provide the complete code and specify the function you want to execute?

If you're looking for a way to find the roots of a polynomial, you might want to use a library like `numpy` or `scipy` in Python. Here's an example of how you might do it with `numpy`:

```python
import numpy as np

coeff = [1, -3, 3, -1]  # This is the polynomial x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1
roots = np.roots(coeff)
print(roots)
```

This will print the roots of the polynomial.

Please provide the complete code and specify the function you want to execute for a more accurate answer.
