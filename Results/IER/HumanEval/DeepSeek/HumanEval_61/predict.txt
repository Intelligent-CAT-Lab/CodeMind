I'm sorry, but the input you provided is not a valid Python code. The function `correct_bracketing` expects a string as input, but you've provided an integer. The function definition for `correct_bracketing` is as follows:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets:
        if b == "(":
            depth += 1
        else:
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0:
            return False
    return depth == 0
```

This function checks if the brackets in the string are correctly nested. It starts with a depth of 0, and for each "(" it encounters, it increments the depth by 1. For each ")" it encounters, it decrements the depth by 1. If at any point the depth goes negative, it means there's a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the function finishes without the depth being negative and the depth is 0, it returns True, indicating that all brackets are correctly nested.

Please provide a valid Python code snippet for me to analyze and execute.
