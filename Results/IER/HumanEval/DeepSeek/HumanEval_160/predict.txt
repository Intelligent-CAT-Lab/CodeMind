The output of `do_algebra(['**', '*', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 5])` would be 47.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

- The expression is initially `2`.
- The next operator is `'**'` (raising to the power of) and the next operand is `3`. So, the expression becomes `2**3`.
- The next operator is `'*'` (multiplication) and the next operand is `4`. So, the expression becomes `2**3*4`.
- The next operator is `'+'` (addition) and the next operand is `5`. So, the expression becomes `2**3*4+5`.
- Finally, the `eval` function evaluates this expression and returns the result.

So, the final result is `2**3*4+5`, which equals `47`.
