I'm sorry, but your question is not clear. The function `correct_bracketing` is defined to take a string as an argument, but you've provided an integer as the argument. The function expects a string of brackets, like "<>", "<<>>", etc. Please provide a string as the argument for the function `correct_bracketing`.

If you meant to ask about the function `correct_bracketing`, I'll be glad to help you analyze it.
