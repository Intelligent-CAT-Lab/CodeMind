### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    def parse_paren_group(s):
        depth = 0
        max_depth = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == '(':
                depth += 1
                max_depth = max(depth, max_depth)
            else:
                depth -= 1

        return max_depth

    return [parse_paren_group(x) for x in paren_string.split(' ') if x]

<Code>

What would be the return value of `parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())') `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `parse_nested_parens` takes a string `paren_string` as input. This string contains nested parentheses groups separated by spaces. The function splits the string into groups using the `split(' ')` method, and then it processes each group using the `parse_paren_group` function.

The `parse_paren_group` function takes a string `s` as input. This string contains parentheses characters only. The function counts the depth of the parentheses nesting in `s`. It starts with a depth of 0 and increases the depth by 1 for each open parenthesis '(' and decreases the depth by 1 for each close parenthesis ')'. The function keeps track of the maximum depth it has seen so far and returns this maximum depth.

The function `parse_nested_parens` returns a list of integers. Each integer in the list corresponds to the maximum depth of parentheses nesting in one of the groups in `paren_string`.

The input string `'(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'` contains four groups of parentheses. The first group has depth 2, the second has depth 3, the third has depth 1, and the fourth has depth 4. So, the output of `parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')` should be `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.

<<<Output>>>
[2, 3, 1, 4]
