### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i

<Code>

What would be the return value of `largest_divisor(3) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:` is defined to find the largest divisor of a given number `n`.

The function starts by iterating over a range from `n` to 1 in reverse order. This is done using the `reversed(range(n))` function. The reason for iterating in reverse order is to find the largest divisor of `n`.

In each iteration, the function checks if `n` is divisible by the current number `i`. This is done by checking if the remainder of `n` divided by `i` is 0 (`n % i == 0`). If `n` is divisible by `i`, the function immediately returns `i` as the largest divisor.

If no divisor is found, the function will return `1` as the largest divisor of `n`. This is because `1` is the smallest divisor of all integers, and if `n` is not divisible by any number other than `1` and itself, it means that `n` is a prime number and its largest divisor is `1`.

So, for the input `3`, the function will iterate over the range `[3, 2, 1]`. For `3`, `2` and `1`, it will check if `3` is divisible by `2` and `1`. Since `3` is not divisible by `2`, it will return `1` as the largest divisor.

So, the output of `largest_divisor(3)` will be `1`.
