### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def iscube(a):
    a = abs(a)
    return int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == a

<Code>

What would be the return value of `iscube(1) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `iscube(a)` takes an integer `a` as input.

The first line of the function `a = abs(a)` converts the input to its absolute value. This is done to ensure that the function works correctly for negative numbers.

The next line `return int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == a` calculates the cube root of `a` and rounds it to the nearest integer. If the cube of this rounded cube root equals `a`, the function returns `True`, indicating that `a` is a perfect cube. If not, it returns `False`.

The cube root of a number `a` is calculated by raising `a` to the power of 1/3. The `round` function is used to round this result to the nearest integer.

The cube of a number `x` is calculated by multiplying `x` by itself twice.

So, for example, if `a` is 8, the cube root of `a` is 2.197 (rounded to 2), and the cube of this is 8. Therefore, `a` is a perfect cube, and the function returns `True`.

If `a` is 7, the cube root of `a` is 1.913 (rounded to 2), and the cube of this is 6. Therefore, `a` is not a perfect cube, and the function returns `False`.

<<<Output>>>
True
