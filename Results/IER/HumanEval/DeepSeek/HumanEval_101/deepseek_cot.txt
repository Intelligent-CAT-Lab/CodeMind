### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def words_string(s):
    if not s:
        return []

    s_list = []

    for letter in s:
        if letter == ',':
            s_list.append(' ')
        else:
            s_list.append(letter)

    s_list = "".join(s_list)
    return s_list.split()

<Code>

What would be the return value of `words_string("Hi, my name is John") `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `words_string(s)` takes a string `s` as input. If the string is empty, it returns an empty list.

The function then creates an empty list `s_list`.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string `s`. If the character is a comma, it appends a space to `s_list`. If the character is not a comma, it appends the character to `s_list`.

After the loop, the function joins `s_list` into a string `s_list` and splits `s_list` into a list of words. The function then returns this list of words.

The string "Hi, my name is John" is passed to the function. The function replaces each comma with a space, resulting in "Hi, my name is John". The function then splits the string into a list of words, which is ['Hi,', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John'].

<<<Output>>>
['Hi,', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']
