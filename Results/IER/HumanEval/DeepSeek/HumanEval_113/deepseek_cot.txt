### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def odd_count(lst):
    res = []
    for arr in lst:
        n = sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)
        res.append("the number of odd elements " + str(n) + "n the str"+ str(n) +"ng "+ str(n) +" of the "+ str(n) +"nput.")
    return res

<Code>

What would be the return value of `odd_count(['1234567']) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `odd_count` takes a list of strings as input. For each string in the list, it counts the number of odd digits in the string. The count is then appended to a new list `res`. The function returns the list `res`.

In the given example, the input is `['1234567']`.

The first string '1234567' is processed. The function `sum` counts the number of odd digits in the string. The count is 4 because the digits '1', '3', '5', and '7' are odd.

The string '1234567' is then appended to the list `res`. The string 'the number of odd elements 4 in the string 4 of the input.' is appended to `res`.

Finally, the function returns the list `res`, which is `['the number of odd elements 4 in the string 4 of the input.']`.

<<<Output>>>
['the number of odd elements 4 in the string 4 of the input.']
