### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_sorted(lst):
    count_digit = dict([(i, 0) for i in lst])
    for i in lst:
        count_digit[i]+=1 
    if any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst):
        return False
    if all(lst[i-1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst))):
        return True
    else:
        return False
    
    

<Code>

What would be the return value of `is_sorted([5]) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_sorted` takes a list `lst` as input.

First, it creates a dictionary `count_digit` where the keys are the elements of `lst` and the values are the counts of these elements in `lst`.

Then, it iterates over `lst` and for each element `i` in `lst`, it increments the count of `i` in `count_digit`.

After that, it checks if there is any element in `lst` that appears more than twice in `lst`. If such an element is found, it returns `False`.

Finally, it checks if all elements in `lst` are in non-decreasing order. If all elements are in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

<<<Output>>>
The output of `is_sorted([5])` would be `True`.

Explanation: The list `[5]` is already sorted in non-decreasing order, so the function returns `True`.
