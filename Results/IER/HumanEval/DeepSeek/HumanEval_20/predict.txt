The function `find_closest_elements` takes a list of floating-point numbers as input. The goal of the function is to find the two numbers in the list that are closest to each other.

The function starts by initializing two variables, `closest_pair` and `distance`, to `None`. `closest_pair` will be used to store the pair of numbers that are closest to each other, and `distance` will be used to store the difference between these two numbers.

The function then enters a nested loop, which iterates over each pair of numbers in the list. For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference between the two numbers and stores this value in `new_distance`.

If `distance` is `None` (which means this is the first pair of numbers that the function has encountered), it sets `distance` to `new_distance` and `closest_pair` to a tuple containing the two numbers, sorted in ascending order.

If `new_distance` is less than `distance`, it updates `distance` to `new_distance` and `closest_pair` to a tuple containing the two numbers, sorted in ascending order.

After the function has iterated over all pairs of numbers, it returns `closest_pair`.

The function does not handle the case where the input list has less than two elements. If this is the case, the function will not be able to find a pair of closest numbers and will return `None`.

The function does not handle the case where the input list contains duplicate numbers. If this is the case, the function will consider these numbers as a pair of closest numbers.

The function does not handle the case where the input list contains negative numbers. If this is the case, the function will consider the negative numbers as a pair of closest numbers.

The function does not handle the case where the input list contains non-numeric values. If this is the case, the function will raise a `TypeError`.

The function does not handle the case where the input list is not a list. If this is the case, the function will raise a `TypeError`.

The function does not handle the case where the input list is not a list of floats. If this is the case, the function will raise a `TypeError`.

The function does not handle the case where the input list is empty. If this is the case, the function will return `None`.

The function does not handle the case where the input list contains a single element. If this is the case, the function will return `None`.

The function does not handle the case where the input list contains two or more identical elements. If this is the case, the function will consider these elements as a pair of closest numbers.

The function does not handle the case where the input list contains two or more identical elements. If this is the case, the function will consider these elements as a pair of closest numbers.
