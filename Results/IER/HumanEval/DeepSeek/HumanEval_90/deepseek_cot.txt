### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst = sorted(set(lst))
    return None if len(lst) < 2 else lst[1]

<Code>

What would be the return value of `next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `next_smallest(lst)` takes a list of integers as input.

The first line of the function sorts the list in ascending order and removes duplicates. This is done using the `sorted()` function and `set()` function.

The function then checks if the length of the list is less than 2. If it is, the function returns `None`. This is because a list with less than 2 elements does not have a second smallest element.

If the list has at least 2 elements, the function returns the second element of the sorted list. This is done using the index `1`, which is the second element in a zero-indexed list.

So, for the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function first sorts the list to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and removes duplicates to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Since the length of the list is 5, it returns the second element of the sorted list, which is `2`.

<<<Output>>>
2
