### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    s = 0
    for num in nums:
        s += -num
        if (s < 0):
            s = 0
        max_sum = max(s, max_sum)
    if max_sum == 0:
        max_sum = max(-i for i in nums)
    min_sum = -max_sum
    return min_sum

<Code>

What would be the return value of `minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `minSubArraySum` takes a list of integers `nums` as input. The goal is to find the smallest subarray sum of `nums`.

The variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the maximum sum of the subarray.

The variable `s` is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current sum of the subarray.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each number `num` in `nums`. For each number, it subtracts the number from `s` and assigns the result back to `s`. If `s` becomes less than 0, it is reset to 0. This is because a negative sum means that the current subarray is not beneficial, so it is discarded and the next subarray starts from the next number.

The code then updates `max_sum` with the maximum of `s` and `max_sum`. This is because `max_sum` keeps track of the maximum sum of the subarray so far.

If `max_sum` is 0, it means that all numbers in `nums` are negative, so the code assigns `max_sum` with the maximum negative number in `nums`.

Finally, the code calculates the minimum subarray sum as `-max_sum` and returns it. This is because the minimum subarray sum is the negative of the maximum subarray sum.

The code then prints the final value of `min_sum`, which is -10.

<<<Output>>>
-10
