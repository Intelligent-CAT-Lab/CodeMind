### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i%2!=0 and "." not in str(i)])

<Code>

What would be the return value of `double_the_difference([0.2, 3, 5]) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `double_the_difference(lst)` takes a list of numbers as input. 

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the list. For each element, it checks if the element is a positive odd integer (i > 0 and i%2 != 0) and if it does not contain a decimal point ("." not in str(i)). If these conditions are met, it squares the element (i**2) and adds it to a new list.

Finally, the function returns the sum of all elements in the new list.

In the given example, the input list is [0.2, 3, 5]. The elements 3 and 5 are positive odd integers and do not contain a decimal point, so they are squared and added to the new list. The sum of these squared elements is 3^2 + 5^2 = 9 + 25 = 34.

So, the return value of `double_the_difference([0.2, 3, 5])` would be 34.

<<<Output>>>
34
