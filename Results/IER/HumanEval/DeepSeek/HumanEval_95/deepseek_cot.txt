### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def check_dict_case(dict):
    if len(dict.keys()) == 0:
        return False
    else:
        state = "start"
        for key in dict.keys():

            if isinstance(key, str) == False:
                state = "mixed"
                break
            if state == "start":
                if key.isupper():
                    state = "upper"
                elif key.islower():
                    state = "lower"
                else:
                    break
            elif (state == "upper" and not key.isupper()) or (state == "lower" and not key.islower()):
                    state = "mixed"
                    break
            else:
                break
        return state == "upper" or state == "lower" 

<Code>

What would be the return value of `check_dict_case({"p":"pineapple", "b":"banana"}) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_dict_case(dict)` takes a dictionary as input. The dictionary contains string keys and values. The function checks if all the keys in the dictionary are either in uppercase or lowercase.

The function starts by checking if the dictionary is empty. If it is, the function returns False.

If the dictionary is not empty, the function initializes a variable `state` to "start". This variable will be used to keep track of the case (upper or lower) of the keys in the dictionary.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over the keys in the dictionary. For each key, it checks if the key is a string. If it is not, the function sets `state` to "mixed" and breaks the loop.

If the key is a string, the function checks the `state`. If it is "start", the function checks if the key is in uppercase or lowercase. If the key is in uppercase, the function sets `state` to "upper". If the key is in lowercase, the function sets `state` to "lower". If the key is neither in uppercase nor in lowercase, the function breaks the loop.

If the `state` is "upper" or "lower", the function checks if the next key is in the same case. If the next key is in the same case, the function continues. If the next key is not in the same case, the function sets `state` to "mixed" and breaks the loop.

After the loop, the function checks if `state` is "upper" or "lower". If it is, the function returns True. If it is not, the function returns False.

In the given example, the dictionary `{"p":"pineapple", "b":"banana"}` has all keys in lowercase. So, the function returns True.

True
