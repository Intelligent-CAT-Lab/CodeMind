### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    def xor(i, j):
        if i == j:
            return '0'
        else:
            return '1'

    return ''.join(xor(x, y) for x, y in zip(a, b))

<Code>

What would be the return value of `string_xor('111000', '101010') `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `string_xor` takes two binary strings `a` and `b` as input. The binary strings are of equal length. The function applies the XOR operation on each pair of corresponding bits in the two strings. The XOR operation is defined as follows: if the two bits are the same, the result is '0', otherwise the result is '1'.

The function `string_xor` uses a helper function `xor` that implements the XOR operation on two bits. The `zip` function is used to pair up the corresponding bits from `a` and `b`. The `join` function is used to concatenate the XOR results into a single string.

For the input `'111000', '101010'`, the function applies the XOR operation as follows:
- The first pair of bits is ('1', '1'), the XOR operation results in '0'.
- The second pair of bits is ('1', '0'), the XOR operation results in '1'.
- The third pair of bits is ('1', '0'), the XOR operation results in '1'.
- The fourth pair of bits is ('0', '1'), the XOR operation results in '1'.
- The fifth pair of bits is ('0', '0'), the XOR operation results in '0'.
- The sixth pair of bits is ('0', '1'), the XOR operation results in '1'.

So the output of `string_xor('111000', '101010')` would be '010010'.
<<<Output>>>
'010010'
