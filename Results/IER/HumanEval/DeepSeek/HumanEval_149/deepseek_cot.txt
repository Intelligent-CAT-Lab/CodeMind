### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    lst.sort()
    new_lst = []
    for i in lst:
        if len(i)%2 == 0:
            new_lst.append(i)
    return sorted(new_lst, key=len)

<Code>

What would be the return value of `sorted_list_sum(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) `? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sorted_list_sum` takes a list of strings as input.
The list is sorted in ascending order.
A new empty list `new_lst` is created.
The function then iterates over each element in the sorted list.
If the length of the element is even (i.e., the number of characters in the string is even), it is added to `new_lst`.
Finally, the function returns a new list sorted by the length of the strings.

In the given example, the input list is ["aa", "a", "aaa"].
The sorted list is ["a", "aa", "aaa"].
The elements "a" and "aa" are added to `new_lst` because their lengths are even.
The function then returns the sorted list `new_lst`, which is ["a", "aa"].

So, the output of `sorted_list_sum(["aa", "a", "aaa"])` would be `["a", "aa"]`.

<<<Output>>>
["a", "aa"]
