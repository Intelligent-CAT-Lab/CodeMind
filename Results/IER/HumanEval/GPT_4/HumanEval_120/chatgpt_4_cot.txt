<<<Analysis>>>
The function `maximum` takes two arguments: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `k`, which is an integer.
The list `arr` is initialized to `[-3, -4, 5]`, and `k` is initialized to `3`.
The function first checks if `k` is `0`. If it were `0`, the function would return an empty list, but since `k` is `3`, the function proceeds to the next step.
The list `arr` is sorted in ascending order, resulting in `[-4, -3, 5]`.
The function then takes the last `k` elements from the sorted list. Since `k` is `3`, it takes all the elements because the list has exactly 3 elements.
The variable `ans` is assigned the value `[-4, -3, 5]`.
The function returns `ans`, which is `[-4, -3, 5]`.
<<<Output>>>
[-4, -3, 5]
