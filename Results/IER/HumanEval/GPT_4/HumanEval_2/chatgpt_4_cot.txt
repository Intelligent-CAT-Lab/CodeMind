<<<Analysis>>>
The function `truncate_number` takes a floating-point number as input.
The input number is 3.5.
The function returns the result of the operation `number % 1.0`, which calculates the remainder of the division of `number` by 1.0.
For the input 3.5, the division by 1.0 leaves a remainder of 0.5, since 3.5 divided by 1.0 is 3 with a remainder of 0.5.
Therefore, the function will return 0.5.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
