It seems there is a mistake in the provided code and question. The function `poly` is defined but not implemented, and the function `find_zero` is mentioned in the question but not defined in the code. Additionally, the `poly` function is calling itself recursively without a base case, which would lead to infinite recursion if executed.

To proceed, I would need the correct implementation of the `poly` function and the definition of the `find_zero` function. Please provide the correct code and the corresponding question.
