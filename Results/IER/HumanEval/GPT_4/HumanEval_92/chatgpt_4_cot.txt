<<<Analysis>>>
The function `any_int` takes three arguments: x, y, and z, which are initialized to 2, 3, and 1, respectively.
The function first checks if all three arguments are integers using `isinstance`. Since all arguments are indeed integers, the condition is True, and the function proceeds to the next check.
The function then checks if the sum of any two arguments equals the third argument. It checks three conditions:
1. x + y == z (2 + 3 == 1) which is False.
2. x + z == y (2 + 1 == 3) which is True.
3. y + z == x (3 + 1 == 2) which is False.
Since the second condition is True, the function will return True.
If none of the conditions were True, the function would return False, but this is not the case here.
