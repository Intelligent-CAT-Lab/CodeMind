<<<Analysis>>>
The function `words_in_sentence` takes a single string argument `sentence` and returns a string containing only the words from the input sentence that have a length that is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself (prime length) or have a length of 2. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The input sentence "This is a test" is split into words ["This", "is", "a", "test"].
2. The function iterates over each word in the list.
3. For the word "This":
   - The length of the word is 4.
   - The loop checks divisibility from 2 to 3 (since the range is from 2 to len(word), which is 4, but the range is exclusive of the upper bound).
   - Since 4 is divisible by 2, `flg` is set to 1.
   - The word "This" is not added to `new_lst` because `flg` is 1 and the length is not 2.
4. For the word "is":
   - The length of the word is 2.
   - The word "is" is added to `new_lst` because its length is 2.
5. For the word "a":
   - The length of the word is 1.
   - `flg` is set to 1 because the length is 1.
   - The word "a" is not added to `new_lst` because `flg` is 1 and the length is not 2.
6. For the word "test":
   - The length of the word is 4.
   - The loop checks divisibility from 2 to 3.
   - Since 4 is divisible by 2, `flg` is set to 1.
   - The word "test" is not added to `new_lst` because `flg` is 1 and the length is not 2.
7. The function returns the words in `new_lst` joined by a space, which is just "is".
