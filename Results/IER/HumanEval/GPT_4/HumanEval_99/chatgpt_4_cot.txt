<<<Analysis>>>
The input value is the string "10".
The function checks if there is exactly one decimal point in the string, which is not the case here, so it skips the if block.
The string "10" is then converted to a float, resulting in the number 10.0.
Since the string does not end with '.5', the code proceeds to the elif block.
The length of the string is greater than 0, so the code executes the statement `res = int(round(num))`.
The round function will round the float 10.0 to the nearest integer, which is 10.
The int function then converts the rounded float to an integer.
The function returns the result, which is the integer 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
