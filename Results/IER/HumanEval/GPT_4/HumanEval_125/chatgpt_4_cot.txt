<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "Hello world!" is passed to the function split_words.
The function first checks if there is a space in the input string. Since "Hello world!" contains a space, the condition is true.
The function then proceeds to split the string by spaces using the split() method and returns the resulting list of words.
The output will be a list containing the words ["Hello", "world!"].
<<<Output>>>
['Hello', 'world!']
