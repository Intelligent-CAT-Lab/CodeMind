<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_closest_vowel` is designed to find the last vowel in a given word that is not adjacent to any other vowels and return it. If the word is less than 3 characters long or no such vowel exists, it returns an empty string.

The input word is "yogurt".

1. The function checks if the length of the word is less than 3. Since "yogurt" is 6 characters long, it proceeds to the next step.
2. A set of vowels is defined, including both lowercase and uppercase vowels.
3. The function then enters a loop that starts from the second-to-last character of the word (index 4, which is 'r') and moves backward towards the second character (index 1, which is 'o').
4. The loop checks each character to see if it is a vowel and not adjacent to any other vowels.
5. The loop starts at index 4 ('r'), which is not a vowel, so it continues.
6. Next, it checks index 3 ('t'), which is also not a vowel, so it continues.
7. Then it checks index 2 ('g'), which is not a vowel, so it continues.
8. Finally, it checks index 1 ('o'), which is a vowel. It then checks the characters before and after 'o' (which are 'y' and 'g', respectively) to see if they are vowels. Since neither 'y' nor 'g' is a vowel, the condition is satisfied.
9. The function returns 'o' as it is the closest vowel to the end of the word that is not adjacent to any other vowels.

<<<Output>>>
o
