<<<Analysis>>>
The input date string '03-11-2000' is passed to the function valid_date.
The function tries to strip any leading or trailing whitespace from the date string, but there is none, so the date remains '03-11-2000'.
The function then splits the date string into month, day, and year using the '-' delimiter.
The split results in month = '03', day = '11', and year = '2000'.
These string values are then converted to integers: month = 3, day = 11, year = 2000.
The function checks if the month is valid (1 <= month <= 12). Since month = 3, it is valid.
The function checks if the day is valid for the given month. Since March (month 3) has 31 days and day = 11, it is valid.
The function does not check for leap years, as it only checks if the day is less than or equal to 29 for February (month 2).
No exception is raised during the execution, so the function returns True, indicating that '03-11-2000' is a valid date.
