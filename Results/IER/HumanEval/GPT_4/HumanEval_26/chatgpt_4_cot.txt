<<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_duplicates` is designed to remove all duplicates from a list of integers and return a list containing only unique elements (elements that appear exactly once).

1. The input list is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.
2. The `collections.Counter` class is used to create a counter object `c` that counts the occurrence of each element in the list. The counter object `c` will look like this: `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1}`.
3. A list comprehension is used to iterate over the original list `numbers` and include only those elements `n` for which the count `c[n]` is less than or equal to 1.
4. The elements that appear more than once (2 and 3) will be excluded from the new list.
5. The resulting list will contain the elements `[1, 4, 5]`, as these are the numbers that appear exactly once in the original list.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 5]
