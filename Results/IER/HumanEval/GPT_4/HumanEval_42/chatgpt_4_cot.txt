<<<Analysis>>>
The function `incr_list` takes a list `l` as an argument.
The list comprehension `[(e + 1) for e in l]` iterates over each element `e` in the list `l` and adds 1 to it.
The input list is `[5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`.
The function processes the input list by incrementing each element by 1, resulting in a new list where each element is the original element plus 1.
The output list will be `[6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]`.
<<<Output>>>
[6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
