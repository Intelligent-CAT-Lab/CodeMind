<<<Analysis>>>
The function `modp` takes two arguments, `n` and `p`, which are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The variable `ret` is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the result of the repeated multiplication and modulus operations.
The code then enters a loop that iterates `n` times, which is 3 times in this case.
In each iteration, `ret` is updated to be two times its previous value, and then the modulus `p` is taken.
Here's the step-by-step calculation:
- First iteration (i = 0): ret = (2 * 1) % 5 = 2 % 5 = 2
- Second iteration (i = 1): ret = (2 * 2) % 5 = 4 % 5 = 4
- Third iteration (i = 2): ret = (2 * 4) % 5 = 8 % 5 = 3
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `ret`, which is 3.
