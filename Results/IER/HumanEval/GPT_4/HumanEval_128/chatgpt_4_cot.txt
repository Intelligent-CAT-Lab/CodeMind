<<<Analysis>>>
The function `prod_signs` takes a list `arr` as input. The input list is `[1, 2, 2, -4]`.

1. The function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns `None`. In this case, the list is not empty, so the function proceeds.

2. The function then checks if the number 0 is in the list. If 0 is present, the product `prod` is set to 0. If 0 is not present, `prod` is set to the result of `(-1) ** len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))`. Since 0 is not in the list `[1, 2, 2, -4]`, it calculates the number of negative numbers in the list using a filter and lambda function. There is one negative number, `-4`, so `len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))` equals 1.

3. The expression `(-1) ** 1` evaluates to `-1`, so `prod` is set to `-1`.

4. The function then calculates the sum of the absolute values of the numbers in the list using a list comprehension `[abs(i) for i in arr]`. The absolute values of the numbers in the list are `[1, 2, 2, 4]`, and their sum is `1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 9`.

5. Finally, the function returns the product of `prod` and the sum of the absolute values, which is `-1 * 9 = -9`.

<<<Output>>>
-9
