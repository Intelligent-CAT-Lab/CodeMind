<<<Analysis>>>
The function `even_odd_palindrome` takes an integer `n` and returns a tuple with the count of even and odd palindromes up to `n`.

The helper function `is_palindrome` checks if a given number is a palindrome by comparing the string representation of the number with its reverse.

The variables `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` are initialized to 0. These will keep track of the count of even and odd palindromes, respectively.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 123.

For each number `i` in this range, the code checks if `i` is odd (`i%2 == 1`) and a palindrome. If it is, it increments `odd_palindrome_count`.

Similarly, if `i` is even (`i%2 == 0`) and a palindrome, it increments `even_palindrome_count`.

The palindromes from 1 to 123 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101, 111, 121. Among these, the even palindromes are 2, 4, 6, 8, 22, 44, 66, 88. So there are 8 even palindromes.

The odd palindromes are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 33, 55, 77, 99, 101, 111, 121. So there are 13 odd palindromes.

After the loop finishes, the function returns a tuple with the counts of even and odd palindromes, which is (8, 13).
