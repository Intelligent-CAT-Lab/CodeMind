<<<Analysis>>>
The function `solution` takes a list `lst` as input.
The list comprehension inside the `sum` function iterates over the list `lst` with both the index and the value (`idx, x`).
The condition `idx%2==0` checks if the index is even (since indexing starts at 0, this will be true for the first, third, fifth, etc., elements of the list).
The condition `x%2==1` checks if the value at that index is odd.
The list comprehension will include only those values that are at an even index and are odd.
In the given list `[5, 8, 7, 1]`, the values at even indices are 5 (index 0) and 7 (index 2), both of which are odd.
The sum of these values is `5 + 7 = 12`.
The function will return this sum, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
