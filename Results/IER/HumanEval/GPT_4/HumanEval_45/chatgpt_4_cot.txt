<<<Analysis>>>
The function `triangle_area` takes two arguments, `a` and `h`, which represent the base and height of a triangle, respectively.
The function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula (base * height) / 2.0.
For the given input, `a` is 5 and `h` is 3.
The calculation would be (5 * 3) / 2.0, which equals 15 / 2.0.
The result of this calculation is 7.5, which is the area of the triangle.
<<<Output>>>
7.5
