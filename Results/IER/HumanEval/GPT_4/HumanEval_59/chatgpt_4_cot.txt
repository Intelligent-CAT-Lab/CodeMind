<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 15.
The function largest_prime_factor contains a nested function is_prime which checks if a given number k is a prime number.
The variable largest is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the largest prime factor found.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 15.
For each number j in this range, the code checks if j is a divisor of n (15 % j == 0) and if j is a prime number (is_prime(j) returns True).
The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5.
The loop finds 3 as a prime factor first and updates largest to 3.
Then the loop finds 5 as a prime factor and updates largest to 5, as it is greater than the current value of largest.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of largest, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
