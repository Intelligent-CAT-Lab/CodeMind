<<<Analysis>>>
The function `all_prefixes` takes a single string argument and initializes an empty list called `result`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the input string, which in this case is 'asdfgh'.
For each index `i`, the code appends a substring of the input string from the beginning up to and including the character at index `i` to the `result` list.
The loop runs 6 times since the input string 'asdfgh' has 6 characters.
The substrings appended to `result` will be: 'a', 'as', 'asd', 'asdf', 'asdfg', and 'asdfgh'.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the `result` list, which contains all the prefixes of the input string.
<<<Output>>>
['a', 'as', 'asd', 'asdf', 'asdfg', 'asdfgh']
