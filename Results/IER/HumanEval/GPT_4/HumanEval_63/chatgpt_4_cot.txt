<<<Analysis>>>
The function `fibfib` is a recursive function that calculates a modified Fibonacci sequence where each term is the sum of the three preceding ones, with the first two terms being 0 and the second term being 1.

The function is called with n = 2.
The function checks if n is 0, which it is not.
The function checks if n is 1, which it is not.
The function checks if n is 2, which it is, so it returns 1.

Since the base case for n = 2 is met, the function returns the value 1 without further recursion.
