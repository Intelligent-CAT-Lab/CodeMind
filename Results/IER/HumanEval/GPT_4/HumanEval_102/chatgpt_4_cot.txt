<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized to 12 and 15, respectively.
The function `choose_num` first checks if x is greater than y, which is not the case here (12 is not greater than 15), so it does not return -1 at this point.
Next, the function checks if y is even by checking `y % 2 == 0`. Since 15 is not even (15 % 2 equals 1), it does not return y at this point.
Then, the function checks if x is equal to y. Since 12 is not equal to 15, it does not return -1 at this point.
Finally, since none of the above conditions were met, the function returns `y - 1`, which is 15 - 1.
Therefore, the return value of `choose_num(12, 15)` is 14.

14
