<<<Analysis>>>
The function `fib4` is designed to compute a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous four numbers in the sequence. The base cases for the sequence are given in the list `results` with the values [0, 0, 2, 0] for the first four terms (n=0, 1, 2, 3).

The input `n` is 5, which is greater than 3, so the function will not return immediately from the base cases.

The function enters a loop that starts at 4 and goes up to `n` (inclusive). For each iteration, it appends to `results` the sum of the last four elements and then removes the first element to keep the list size at 4.

The loop runs only once since `n` is 5. In this single iteration, the sum of the last four elements of `results` is calculated as follows:
0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 2

This sum (2) is appended to the list, and the first element (0) is removed, resulting in the new `results` list being [0, 2, 0, 2].

After the loop, the function returns the last element of the `results` list, which is 2.
