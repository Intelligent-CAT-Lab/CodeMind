<<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_by_prefix` takes two arguments: `strings`, which is a list of strings, and `prefix`, which is a string.
The input provided to the function is an empty list `[]` and the prefix `'john'`.
Since the list `strings` is empty, the list comprehension `[x for x in strings if x.startswith(prefix)]` will not iterate over any elements.
Therefore, the function will return an empty list `[]` because there are no strings to check for the prefix `'john'`.
