<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 3, 4, and 5, respectively.
The function first checks if the given sides can form a triangle by verifying if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Since 3 + 4 > 5, 3 + 5 > 4, and 4 + 5 > 3, the sides can form a triangle.
The semi-perimeter s is calculated as (a + b + c) / 2, which is (3 + 4 + 5) / 2 = 6.
The area of the triangle is then calculated using Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), which is sqrt(6 * (6 - 3) * (6 - 4) * (6 - 5)) = sqrt(6 * 3 * 2 * 1) = sqrt(36) = 6.
The area is then rounded to two decimal places, which is still 6.00.
The function returns the value of the area, which is 6.00.
<<<Output>>>
6.00
