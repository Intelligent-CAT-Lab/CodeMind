<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_multiply_prime(a)` is designed to check if the input number `a` can be expressed as the product of three distinct prime numbers. The input `a` is initialized to 5.

The function `is_prime(n)` is a helper function that checks if a given number `n` is prime. It does this by attempting to divide `n` by all numbers from 2 up to `n-1`. If any division results in a remainder of 0, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is not prime. If no such division is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.

The main function `is_multiply_prime(a)` then iterates over all numbers from 2 to 100 (inclusive) three times, nested, with the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. For each of these numbers, it checks if they are prime using the `is_prime` function. If any of the numbers is not prime, it continues to the next iteration without checking the product.

The function is looking for a combination of three prime numbers whose product equals the input number `a`. Since `a` is 5, and 5 is a prime number itself, there is no way to express it as a product of three distinct prime numbers because any product that involves 5 and other prime numbers will be greater than 5.

Therefore, the function will not find such a combination and will return `False`.
