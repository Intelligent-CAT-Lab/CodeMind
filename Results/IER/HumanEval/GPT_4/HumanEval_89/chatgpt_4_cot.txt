The function `encrypt` takes a string `s` as input and initializes a string `d` containing the lowercase alphabet.
An empty string `out` is initialized to store the result of the encryption.
The function then iterates over each character `c` in the input string `s`.
If the character `c` is found in the string `d` (meaning it's a lowercase letter), the function finds the index of `c` in `d`, multiplies it by 2 (as per the `2*2` in the code), and then takes the modulo with 26 (the length of the alphabet) to ensure it wraps around if the index goes beyond 25.
The character at the new index in `d` is then appended to the `out` string.
If the character `c` is not in `d` (meaning it's not a lowercase letter), it is appended to `out` as it is.
For the input 'hi', the character 'h' is at index 7 in `d`, so the new index is (7+2*2) % 26 = (7+4) % 26 = 11 % 26 = 11, which corresponds to the letter 'l'.
The character 'i' is at index 8 in `d`, so the new index is (8+2*2) % 26 = (8+4) % 26 = 12 % 26 = 12, which corresponds to the letter 'm'.
Therefore, the encrypted string is 'lm'.
