<<<Analysis>>>
The function `largest_smallest_integers` takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the largest of the negative integers and the smallest of the positive integers from the list.

The input list is `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]`.

The variable `smallest` is initialized by filtering the input list to include only negative numbers. Since there are no negative numbers in the input list, `smallest` will be an empty list.

The variable `largest` is initialized by filtering the input list to include only positive numbers. Since all numbers in the input list are positive, `largest` will be the same as the input list `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]`.

The function then returns a tuple:
- The first element is the maximum of `smallest` if `smallest` is not empty, otherwise `None`. Since `smallest` is empty, the first element of the tuple will be `None`.
- The second element is the minimum of `largest` if `largest` is not empty, otherwise `None`. Since `largest` contains `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]`, the minimum is `1`.

Therefore, the function will return `(None, 1)`.

<<<Output>>>
(None, 1)
