<<<Analysis>>>
The function `change_base` is designed to convert a decimal number `x` into a string representing that number in a different base `base`.

The variable `x` is initialized to 8, and the variable `base` is initialized to 3.
The variable `ret` is initialized to an empty string, which will be used to build the base-converted number as a string.

The function enters a while loop that continues as long as `x` is greater than 0.

1. In the first iteration, `x` is 8, which is greater than 0, so the loop continues.
   - `x % base` is `8 % 3`, which equals 2. This is the remainder of 8 divided by 3.
   - `ret` becomes `str(2)` + `""`, which is "2".
   - `x` is updated to `x // base`, which is `8 // 3`, resulting in `x` becoming 2.

2. In the second iteration, `x` is now 2, still greater than 0.
   - `x % base` is `2 % 3`, which equals 2. This is the remainder of 2 divided by 3.
   - `ret` becomes `str(2)` + "2", which is "22".
   - `x` is updated to `x // base`, which is `2 // 3`, resulting in `x` becoming 0.

The while loop ends because `x` is now 0.

The function returns `ret`, which is "22".

"22"
