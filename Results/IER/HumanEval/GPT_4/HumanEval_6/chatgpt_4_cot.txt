The function `parse_nested_parens` takes a string `paren_string` as input and returns a list of integers representing the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group of parentheses in the string. The groups are separated by spaces.

The input string `'(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'` is split into individual groups based on spaces, resulting in the list `['(()())', '((()))', '()', '((())()())']`.

The function `parse_paren_group` is defined within `parse_nested_parens` and is used to calculate the maximum depth of a single group of parentheses. It initializes `depth` to 0 and `max_depth` to 0. As it iterates through the characters in the group, it increments `depth` by 1 for every '(' and decrements it by 1 for every ')'. The `max_depth` is updated to be the maximum of the current `depth` and the current `max_depth`.

The function `parse_nested_parens` then uses a list comprehension to apply `parse_paren_group` to each group in the split list and returns the resulting list of maximum depths.

Let's analyze each group:
1. '(()())' has a maximum depth of 2.
2. '((()))' has a maximum depth of 3.
3. '()' has a maximum depth of 1.
4. '((())()())' has a maximum depth of 3.

Therefore, the function will return a list with these maximum depths: [2, 3, 1, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 3, 1, 3]
