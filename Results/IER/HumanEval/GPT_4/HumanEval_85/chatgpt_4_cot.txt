<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add` takes a list `lst` as an argument.
The list comprehension inside the `sum` function iterates over the list `lst` starting from index 1 to the end of the list, with a step of 2, meaning it considers every second element of the list.
For each element at an odd index (since indexing starts at 0), it checks if the element is even (lst[i]%2 == 0).
If the element is even, it is included in the list comprehension and will be part of the sum.
In the given input list `[4, 88]`, the element at index 1 is 88, which is even.
Since there are no other elements at odd indices, the list comprehension will only include this one element.
The `sum` function will then return the sum of the list comprehension, which in this case is just the single element 88.
<<<Output>>>
88
