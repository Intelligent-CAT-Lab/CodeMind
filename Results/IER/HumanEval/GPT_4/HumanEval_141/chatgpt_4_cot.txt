<<<Analysis>>>
The function `file_name_check` is designed to validate a file name based on certain criteria:
- The file name must have exactly two parts separated by a dot.
- The file extension must be one of the following: 'txt', 'exe', 'dll'.
- The file name (excluding the extension) must not be empty.
- The first character of the file name must be a letter.
- The file name can contain at most 3 digits.

The input to the function is "example.txt".

1. The variable `suf` is initialized with a list of valid file extensions: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'].
2. The `file_name` is split by the dot character into the list `lst`.
3. The length of `lst` is checked to ensure there are exactly two elements (the file name and the extension). In this case, `lst` will be ['example', 'txt'], so the length is 2, which is valid.
4. The function checks if the file extension (lst[1]) is in the list `suf`. Since 'txt' is in `suf`, this check passes.
5. The function checks if the file name part (lst[0]) is empty. Since 'example' is not empty, this check passes.
6. The function checks if the first character of the file name part is a letter. Since 'e' is a letter, this check passes.
7. The function counts the number of digits in the file name part. Since 'example' has no digits, the count is 0, which is less than or equal to 3, so this check passes.

Since all checks pass, the function will return 'Yes'.
