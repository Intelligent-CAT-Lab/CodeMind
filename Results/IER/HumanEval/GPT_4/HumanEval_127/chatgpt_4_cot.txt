<<<Analysis>>>
The function `intersection` takes two tuples as input, representing two intervals. The input intervals are (1, 2) and (2, 3).

The function `is_prime` is defined within `intersection` to check if a number is prime. It returns False for 0 and 1, True for 2, and for any other number, it checks if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the number itself minus one.

The variable `l` is set to the maximum of the first elements of the two intervals, which is max(1, 2) = 2.
The variable `r` is set to the minimum of the second elements of the two intervals, which is min(2, 3) = 2.

The variable `length` is calculated as `r - l`, which is 2 - 2 = 0.

Since `length` is not greater than 0, the condition `length > 0 and is_prime(length)` is not met, and the function does not need to check if `length` is prime.

Therefore, the function returns "NO" without needing to call `is_prime`.
