<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_squares` takes a list `lst` as input.
The variable `result` is initialized to an empty list, which will store the transformed elements of `lst`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of `lst` (from 0 to the length of `lst` - 1).

For each index `i` in this range, the code performs the following checks and actions:
- If `i` is divisible by 3 (`i % 3 == 0`), it appends the square of the element at index `i` to `result`. This condition is met when `i` is 0, so `lst[0]` which is 1, is squared and appended to `result` as 1.
- If `i` is divisible by 4 and not by 3 (`i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0`), it appends the cube of the element at index `i` to `result`. This condition is not met for any index in this case.
- Otherwise, it appends the element at index `i` as it is to `result`. This condition is met for `i` equal to 1 and 2, so `lst[1]` which is 2, and `lst[2]` which is 3, are appended to `result` as they are.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the sum of the elements in `result`.
For the input `[1,2,3]`, the `result` list will be `[1, 2, 3]` after the loop.
The sum of the elements in `result` is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
