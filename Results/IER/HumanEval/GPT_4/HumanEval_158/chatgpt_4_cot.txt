<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_max` takes a list of words as input and returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters. If there is a tie, it returns the word that comes first alphabetically.

The input list is `["name", "of", "string"]`.

The `sorted` function is used with a key that is a lambda function. This lambda function sorts the words primarily by the negative length of the set of characters in each word (which gives us the number of unique characters in descending order), and secondarily by the word itself in ascending alphabetical order.

The set of each word is as follows:
- "name" has a set of {'n', 'a', 'm', 'e'}, which has 4 unique characters.
- "of" has a set of {'o', 'f'}, which has 2 unique characters.
- "string" has a set of {'s', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g'}, which has 6 unique characters.

Sorting by the primary key (number of unique characters in descending order), we get:
- "string" (6 unique characters)
- "name" (4 unique characters)
- "of" (2 unique characters)

Since "string" has the most unique characters, it is the first element in the sorted list.

The function then returns the first element of this sorted list, which is "string".

<<<Output>>>
"string"
