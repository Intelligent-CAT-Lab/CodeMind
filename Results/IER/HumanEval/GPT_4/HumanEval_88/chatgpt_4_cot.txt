<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_array` takes a list called `array` as input.
The function first checks if the length of the array is 0. If it is, it returns an empty list.
Since the input array `[15, 42, 87, 32, 11, 0]` is not empty, the function proceeds to the `else` clause.
The `else` clause sorts the array. The sorting order is determined by the condition `(array[0] + array[-1]) % 2 == 0`.
The first element of the array is 15, and the last element is 0. The sum of these two numbers is 15 + 0 = 15.
15 % 2 is 1, which is not equal to 0, so the condition evaluates to `False`.
Since the condition is `False`, the array is sorted in ascending order.
The sorted array in ascending order is `[0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87]`.
This sorted array is returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87]
