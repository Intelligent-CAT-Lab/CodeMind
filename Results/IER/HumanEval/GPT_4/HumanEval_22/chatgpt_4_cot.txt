<<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_integers` is designed to take a list of values and return a new list containing only the integers from the original list.
The input list is `[3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b']`.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and check if it is an instance of `int` using the `isinstance` function.
The elements that are integers are 3, 3, and 3.
These integers are collected into a new list.
The function returns this new list containing only the integers.
<<<Output>>>
[3, 3, 3]
