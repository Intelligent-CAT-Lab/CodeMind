<<<Analysis>>>
The function `monotonic` takes a list `l` as input.
The list `l` is compared to its sorted version and its reverse sorted version.
The input list is `[1, 2, 4, 10]`.
The sorted version of `l` is `[1, 2, 4, 10]`, which is the same as the input list.
The reverse sorted version of `l` would be `[10, 4, 2, 1]`, which is not the same as the input list.
Since the input list is equal to its sorted version, the list is monotonic.
Therefore, the function will return `True`.
