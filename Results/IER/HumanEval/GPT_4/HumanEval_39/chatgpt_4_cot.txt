<<<Analysis>>>
The function `prime_fib` is designed to find the nth prime number in the Fibonacci sequence. The input `n` is initialized to 1, meaning we want to find the first prime number in the Fibonacci sequence.

The function `is_prime` is a helper function that checks if a number `p` is prime. It returns `False` if `p` is less than 2. Otherwise, it checks divisibility of `p` by all numbers from 2 up to the square root of `p`. If any number divides `p`, it returns `False`; if none do, it returns `True`.

The list `f` is initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.

The `while` loop starts to generate Fibonacci numbers by appending the sum of the last two numbers in the list `f`.

After each new Fibonacci number is generated, the `is_prime` function is called to check if this new number is prime.

Since we are looking for the first prime number in the Fibonacci sequence, as soon as we find a prime number, we decrement `n` by 1. When `n` reaches 0, we return the last number in the Fibonacci sequence, which is the prime number we were looking for.

The first few Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. The first prime number in this sequence is 2.

Therefore, the function will return 2 for the input `prime_fib(1)`.
