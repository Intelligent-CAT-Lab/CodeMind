<<<Analysis>>>
The function `next_smallest` is called with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
The list is first converted to a set to remove any duplicates, but since there are no duplicates in this list, it remains unchanged.
The set is then converted back to a list and sorted in ascending order, resulting in the same list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
The function checks if the length of the list is less than 2, which it is not, so it proceeds to the else clause.
The second smallest element in the sorted list is at index 1, which is the number `2`.
The function returns the value `2`.
<<<Output>>>
2
