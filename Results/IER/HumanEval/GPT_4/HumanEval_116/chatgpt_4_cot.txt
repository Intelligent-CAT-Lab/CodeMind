<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_array` takes a list `arr` as input and returns a sorted version of the list. The sorting is done in two steps:
1. The list is first sorted in ascending order. This is done using the `sorted` function.
2. The list is then sorted again, but this time using a key function that sorts the elements based on the count of '1's in their binary representation.

Let's analyze the input `[1,5,2,3,4]` step by step:
- First, the list is sorted in ascending order: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- Then, we need to sort the list based on the count of '1's in the binary representation of each number:
  - `1` in binary is `1`, which has `1` one.
  - `2` in binary is `10`, which has `1` one.
  - `3` in binary is `11`, which has `2` ones.
  - `4` in binary is `100`, which has `1` one.
  - `5` in binary is `101`, which has `2` ones.
- Now, we sort the list based on the count of '1's: numbers with fewer '1's come first. If two numbers have the same count of '1's, they remain in ascending order from the previous sort.
- The final sorted list based on the count of '1's is: `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
