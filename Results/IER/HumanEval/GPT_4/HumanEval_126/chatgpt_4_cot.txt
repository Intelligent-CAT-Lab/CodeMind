<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_sorted` is designed to check two conditions:
1. No digit appears more than twice in the list.
2. The list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The input list is `[5]`.

First, a dictionary `count_digit` is created with keys from the input list and initial values of 0. In this case, the dictionary will be `{5: 0}`.

Next, the function iterates over the list and increments the corresponding value in `count_digit` for each digit. After this loop, `count_digit` will be `{5: 1}` because the number 5 appears once in the list.

The function then checks if any digit appears more than twice using the `any` function. Since the maximum count for any digit is 1, this condition is not met, and the function does not return `False`.

Finally, the function checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Since there is only one element in the list, it is trivially sorted. Therefore, the function will return `True`.
