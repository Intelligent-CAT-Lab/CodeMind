The function `greatest_common_divisor` takes two integers, `a` and `b`, and calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.

1. The initial values of `a` and `b` are 3 and 7, respectively.
2. The while loop continues to execute as long as `b` is not zero.
3. In the first iteration, since `b` is 7, which is not zero, the loop body executes. Inside the loop, `a` is assigned the value of `b` (which is 7), and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b` (which is 3 % 7).
4. Since 3 % 7 is 3 (because 3 is less than 7), `b` becomes 3.
5. Now `a` is 7 and `b` is 3. The loop continues.
6. In the second iteration, `a` is assigned the value of `b` (which is 3), and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b` (which is 7 % 3).
7. Since 7 % 3 is 1, `b` becomes 1.
8. Now `a` is 3 and `b` is 1. The loop continues.
9. In the third iteration, `a` is assigned the value of `b` (which is 1), and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b` (which is 3 % 1).
10. Since 3 % 1 is 0, `b` becomes 0.
11. Now `a` is 1 and `b` is 0. The loop terminates because `b` is zero.
12. The function returns the current value of `a`, which is 1.

The greatest common divisor of 3 and 7 is 1, as they are both prime numbers and do not have any common divisors other than 1.
