<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_closest_elements` is designed to find the pair of elements in the list `numbers` that are closest to each other in value.

The input list is `[1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]`.

The variables `closest_pair` and `distance` are initialized to `None`.

The function uses two nested loops to compare each element with every other element in the list. The outer loop iterates over the elements of the list, and the inner loop does the same. The condition `if idx != idx2:` ensures that an element is not compared with itself.

For the first comparison, since `distance` is `None`, it is set to the absolute difference between the first two distinct elements, which are `1.0` and `2.0`. The `closest_pair` is set to `(1.0, 2.0)` after sorting.

The function continues to compare all possible pairs of elements. Whenever it finds a pair with a smaller distance than the current `distance`, it updates `distance` and `closest_pair`.

After comparing all pairs, the smallest distance found is between `2.0` and `2.2`, which is `0.2`. Therefore, the `closest_pair` is set to `(2.0, 2.2)`.

The function returns the `closest_pair` which is the pair of elements with the smallest distance between them.

(2.0, 2.2)
