<<<Analysis>>>
The function `mean_absolute_deviation` takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the mean absolute deviation of the list.
The input list is `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`.
First, the mean of the numbers is calculated. The mean is `(1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0) / 3 = 6.0 / 3 = 2.0`.
Next, the function calculates the absolute deviation of each number from the mean and then takes the average of those deviations.
The deviations are `abs(1.0 - 2.0)`, `abs(2.0 - 2.0)`, and `abs(3.0 - 2.0)`, which are `1.0`, `0.0`, and `1.0`, respectively.
The sum of the absolute deviations is `1.0 + 0.0 + 1.0 = 2.0`.
Finally, the mean absolute deviation is the sum of the absolute deviations divided by the number of elements in the list, which is `2.0 / 3 = 0.6666666666666666`.
<<<Output>>>
0.6666666666666666
