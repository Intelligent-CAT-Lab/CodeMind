The function `count_nums` takes a list `arr` as input and defines a nested function `digits_sum` that calculates the sum of the digits of a number, taking into account if the number is negative.

1. The input list `arr` is `[1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. The `digits_sum` function is called for each element in `arr`.
3. For each number `n` in `arr`, if `n` is negative, it is multiplied by -1 and `neg` is set to -1 to keep track of the original sign.
4. The number `n` is then converted to a list of its digits.
5. The first digit of the list is multiplied by `neg` to restore its original sign if the number was negative.
6. The sum of the digits is returned.
7. The `digits_sum` function is applied to each element in `arr`, resulting in a new list of digit sums: `[1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5]`.
8. A `filter` function is used to keep only the positive sums from the list of digit sums.
9. The length of the filtered list is returned, which represents the count of numbers with a positive digit sum.

Let's calculate the digit sums for each element in `arr`:
- `digits_sum(1)` returns `1` (positive).
- `digits_sum(1)` returns `1` (positive).
- `digits_sum(2)` returns `2` (positive).
- `digits_sum(-2)` returns `-2` (negative, because the original number was negative).
- `digits_sum(3)` returns `3` (positive).
- `digits_sum(4)` returns `4` (positive).
- `digits_sum(5)` returns `5` (positive).

The filtered list of positive digit sums is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
The length of this list is `6`.

Therefore, the return value of `count_nums([1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5])` is `6`.
