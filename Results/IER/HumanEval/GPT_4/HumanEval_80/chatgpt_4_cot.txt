<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_happy` takes a string `s` as input.
The input string `s` is "a".
The function first checks if the length of `s` is less than 3. If it is, the function returns False.
Since the length of "a" is 1, which is less than 3, the function will return False without entering the for loop.
<<<Output>>>
False
