<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 14.
The code checks if n is even or odd. Since 14 is even, it initializes an empty list called odd_collatz.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than 1.
In the first iteration, since n is even (14), it is divided by 2, resulting in n becoming 7.
Since 7 is odd, it is added to the odd_collatz list.
In the next iteration, n is now 7, which is odd, so the code executes the else block: n becomes 7*3 + 1, which is 22.
Since 22 is even, the loop continues without adding it to the list.
In the next iteration, n is divided by 2, becoming 11, which is odd and added to the list.
The process continues with the following transformations: 11 -> 34 -> 17 -> 52 -> 26 -> 13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1.
The odd numbers encountered during this process are 7, 11, 17, 13, and 5, which are added to the list.
Once n reaches 1, the loop ends.
The code returns the sorted list of odd numbers, which is [5, 7, 11, 13, 17].

[5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
