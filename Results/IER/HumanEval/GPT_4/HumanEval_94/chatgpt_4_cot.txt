<<<Analysis>>>
The function `skjkasdkd` takes a list of integers as input and finds the largest prime number in the list. It then returns the sum of the digits of this largest prime number.

1. The input list is `[0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]`.
2. The variable `maxx` is initialized to 0, which will hold the maximum prime number found in the list.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0, which will be used to iterate through the list.
4. The while loop starts and will run until `i` is less than the length of the list.
5. Inside the loop, the function `isPrime` is called to check if the current element `lst[i]` is a prime number.
6. If the current element is greater than `maxx` and is a prime number, `maxx` is updated to this new value.
7. The loop continues until all elements have been checked.
8. The largest prime number found in the list is `181`.
9. The sum of the digits of `181` is calculated: `1 + 8 + 1 = 10`.
10. The function returns the result, which is `10`.
