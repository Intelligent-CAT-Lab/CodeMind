<<<Analysis>>>
The function `string_to_md5` takes a single argument `text`, which is a string.
The hashlib library is imported, which provides the algorithms for message digests such as MD5.
The function checks if the `text` is not empty (truthy). Since 'Hello world' is a non-empty string, the condition is true.
The `text` is then encoded to ASCII using `text.encode('ascii')`.
The encoded text is passed to `hashlib.md5()`, which computes the MD5 hash of the text.
The `hexdigest()` method is called on the resulting hash object to get the hexadecimal representation of the MD5 hash.
The MD5 hash for 'Hello world' is computed and returned as a string.
