<<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_distinct_characters` takes a single string argument and returns the number of distinct characters in the string, ignoring case.
The input string is the concatenation of 'abcde', 'cade', and 'CADE', resulting in 'abcdecadeCADE'.
The `set` function is used to create a set of characters from the input string, which automatically removes any duplicate characters. The `lower` method is called on the string to ensure that case is ignored, so 'C' and 'c' are considered the same character.
The resulting set of characters from the string 'abcdecadeCADE'.lower() is {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}.
The length of this set is 5, as there are 5 distinct characters.
The function returns this length.
<<<Output>>>
5
