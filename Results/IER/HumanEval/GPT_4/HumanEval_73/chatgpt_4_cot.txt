<<<Analysis>>>
The function `smallest_change` is designed to count the minimum number of changes needed to make the input array symmetric. It does this by comparing elements from the start and end of the array moving towards the center.

The input array is `[1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]`.

The length of the array is 8, so the loop will iterate 8 // 2 = 4 times.

The loop compares the following pairs of elements:
- First iteration: arr[0] (1) and arr[7] (6) are not equal, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
- Second iteration: arr[1] (2) and arr[6] (9) are not equal, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
- Third iteration: arr[2] (3) and arr[5] (7) are not equal, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
- Fourth iteration: arr[3] (5) and arr[4] (4) are not equal, so `ans` is incremented by 1.

After the loop, `ans` is equal to 4, which is the number of changes needed to make the array symmetric.
