<<<Analysis>>>
The function `select_words` takes two arguments: a string `s` and an integer `n`. The string `s` is "Mary had a little lamb" and `n` is 4.
The function initializes an empty list `result` to store the words that meet the condition.
The function splits the string `s` into words and iterates over each word.
For each word, it initializes `n_consonants` to 0, which will count the number of consonants in the word.
The function then iterates over each character in the word, converting it to lowercase and checking if it is not a vowel ("a", "e", "i", "o", "u").
If the character is not a vowel, it increments `n_consonants` by 1.
After counting the consonants in a word, the function checks if `n_consonants` is equal to `n` (which is 4 in this case).
If the condition is met, the word is appended to the `result` list.
The words in the string "Mary had a little lamb" are checked one by one:
- "Mary" has 3 consonants ("M", "r", "y"), so it is not added to `result`.
- "had" has 2 consonants ("h", "d"), so it is not added to `result`.
- "a" has 0 consonants, so it is not added to `result`.
- "little" has 4 consonants ("l", "t", "t", "l"), so it is added to `result`.
- "lamb" has 3 consonants ("l", "m", "b"), so it is not added to `result`.
Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains only the words with exactly 4 consonants.
