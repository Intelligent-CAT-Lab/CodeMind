<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_positive` takes a list `l` as an argument.
The list comprehension `[e for e in l if e > 0]` iterates over each element `e` in the list `l`.
For each element, it checks if `e` is greater than 0.
If the condition `e > 0` is true, the element `e` is included in the new list.
The input list is `[-1, -2, 4, 5, 6]`.
The elements `-1` and `-2` are not greater than 0, so they are not included in the new list.
The elements `4`, `5`, and `6` are greater than 0, so they are included in the new list.
The function returns the new list containing only the positive elements from the original list, which is `[4, 5, 6]`.
<<<Output>>>
[4, 5, 6]
