<<<Analysis>>>
The function `fix_spaces` is designed to replace spaces in a string with underscores or a hyphen based on the number of consecutive spaces. The input string is "Example", which contains no spaces.
The variable `new_text` is initialized to an empty string, which will be used to build the output.
The variables `start` and `end` are initialized to 0, which are used to track the start and end of a sequence of spaces.
The function enters a while loop that iterates over each character in the input string.
Since there are no spaces in "Example", the condition `if text[i] == " "` is never true.
Therefore, the `else` block is executed for each character, which simply appends the current character to `new_text`.
After the loop, the final `if` and `elif` conditions are checked, but since there were no spaces, `end - start` is not greater than 0, so nothing is appended to `new_text`.
The function returns the `new_text`, which is the same as the input string "Example".
