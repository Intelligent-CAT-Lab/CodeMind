<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_prime` is designed to check if a given number n is a prime number.
The input number n is initialized to 6.
The function first checks if n is less than 2, which it is not, so it proceeds to the for loop.
The for loop iterates from 2 to n - 1, which in this case means it will check numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 to see if any of these numbers are divisors of 6.
When k is 2, the condition `n % k == 0` is checked. Since 6 % 2 equals 0, the condition is true, indicating that 6 is divisible by 2.
Because 6 has a divisor other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.
The function returns False as soon as it finds that 6 is divisible by 2, without checking the other numbers.
<<<Output>>>
False
