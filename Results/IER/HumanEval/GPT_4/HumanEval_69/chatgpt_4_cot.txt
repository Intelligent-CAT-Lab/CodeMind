<<<Analysis>>>
The function `search` takes a list `lst` as input.
The list `lst` is initialized to `[5, 5, 5, 5, 1]`.
A list `frq` is created with a size of `max(lst) + 1`, which is `5 + 1 = 6`. So `frq` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
The function then iterates over each element in `lst` and increments the corresponding index in `frq` by 1. After this loop, `frq` becomes `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4]` because there is one `1` and four `5`s in `lst`.
The variable `ans` is initialized to `-1`.
The function then iterates over `frq` starting from index 1. It checks if `frq[i]` is greater than or equal to `i`. If it is, `ans` is updated to `i`.
The condition `frq[i] >= i` is met when `i` is `1` (since `frq[1]` is `1`) and when `i` is `5` (since `frq[5]` is `4`, which is not greater than or equal to `5`). However, the loop continues to the end of `frq`, and `ans` is updated each time the condition is met.
The last value that meets the condition is `5`, so `ans` is updated to `5`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is `5`.
