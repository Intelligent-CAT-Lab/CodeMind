<<<Analysis>>>
The function `specialFilter` takes a list of numbers as input and initializes a variable `count` to 0.
It then iterates over each number in the input list `nums`.
For each number, it first checks if the number is greater than 10. If not, it moves to the next number.
If the number is greater than 10, it checks if the first and last digits of the number are odd. The tuple `odd_digits` contains the odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
The number is converted to a string, and the first and last characters are checked against the `odd_digits` tuple.
If both the first and last digits are odd, `count` is incremented by 1.
After iterating through all numbers, the function returns the value of `count`.

In the given input `[5, -2, 1, -5]`, none of the numbers are greater than 10, so the `count` will not be incremented.
Therefore, the function will return 0.
