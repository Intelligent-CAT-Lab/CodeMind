<<<Analysis>>>
The function `unique_digits` takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted list of integers from the input list that have all odd digits.

The input list is `[15, 33, 1422, 1]`.

The variable `odd_digit_elements` is initialized as an empty list.

The function iterates over each element `i` in the input list:
- For `i = 15`, the function checks if all digits are odd by converting `i` to a string and iterating over each character `c`. Since both digits '1' and '5' are odd, `15` is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
- For `i = 33`, the function performs the same check. Both digits '3' and '3' are odd, so `33` is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
- For `i = 1422`, the function finds that not all digits are odd (since '4' and '2' are even), so it is not appended to `odd_digit_elements`.
- For `i = 1`, the function finds that the digit '1' is odd, so `1` is appended to `odd_digit_elements`.

After the loop, the `odd_digit_elements` list contains `[15, 33, 1]`.

The function then returns the sorted version of `odd_digit_elements`, which is `[1, 15, 33]`.
