<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_nested` is designed to check if a string containing only opening and closing square brackets has at least two nested pairs of brackets.

The input string is `'[[ ]]'`.

1. Two lists, `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index`, are initialized to keep track of the indices of the opening and closing brackets, respectively.

2. The function iterates over each character in the string. For the input `'[[ ]]'`, it will do the following:
   - When `i` is 0, `string[i]` is `'['`, so `0` is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
   - When `i` is 1, `string[i]` is `'['`, so `1` is appended to `opening_bracket_index`.
   - When `i` is 2, `string[i]` is `']'`, so `2` is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.
   - When `i` is 3, `string[i]` is `']'`, so `3` is appended to `closing_bracket_index`.

3. After the loop, `opening_bracket_index` is `[0, 1]` and `closing_bracket_index` is `[2, 3]`.

4. The `closing_bracket_index` list is reversed, resulting in `[3, 2]`.

5. The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0, and `i` is initialized to 0. The variable `l` is set to the length of `closing_bracket_index`, which is 2.

6. The function then iterates over each index in `opening_bracket_index` and checks if there is a corresponding closing bracket index that is greater than the opening bracket index. For each pair found, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `i` is incremented to move to the next closing bracket index.

7. For the first opening bracket at index 0, there is a closing bracket at index 3, so `cnt` becomes 1 and `i` becomes 1.

8. For the second opening bracket at index 1, there is a closing bracket at index 2, so `cnt` becomes 2 and `i` becomes 2.

9. The loop ends, and since `cnt` is now 2, which is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns `True`.
