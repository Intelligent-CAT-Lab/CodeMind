<<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_vowels` is defined to take a single argument `text`.
The input string 'fedcba' is passed to the function.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character `s` in the input text.
For each character, it checks if the lowercase version of `s` is not in the list of vowels ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"].
If the character is not a vowel, it is included in the list comprehension's output list.
The list comprehension's output list is then joined into a string using `"".join()`.
The characters 'f', 'd', 'c', and 'b' are not vowels, so they are included in the final string.
The characters 'e' and 'a' are vowels, so they are not included in the final string.
The final string, which is the return value of the function, is 'fdcb'.
<<<Output>>>
'fdcb'
