The function `factorize` is designed to return the prime factorization of the given integer `n`.
The input `n` is initialized to 2.
An empty list `fact` is created to store the factors of `n`.
The variable `i` is initialized to 2, which is the smallest prime number.
The while loop will run as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` plus 1. Since `n` is 2, the square root of `n` is approximately 1.41, and adding 1 gives us 2.41. Therefore, the loop condition is `i <= 2.41`.
The loop starts, and since `n % i` is 0 (because `n` is 2 and `i` is also 2), the condition is true.
`i` (which is 2) is appended to the `fact` list.
`n` is divided by `i` and updated to `n // i`, which is `2 // 2`, resulting in `n` becoming 1.
The loop condition is checked again, but since `n` is now 1, the loop exits.
After the loop, there is a check to see if `n` is greater than 1. Since `n` is 1, this condition is false, and nothing more is appended to `fact`.
The function returns the list `fact`, which contains the single element [2], representing the prime factorization of 2.
