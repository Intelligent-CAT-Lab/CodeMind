<<<Analysis>>>
The function `fruit_distribution` takes two arguments: a string `s` and an integer `n`. The string `s` is "5 apples and 6 oranges" and `n` is 19.
The function initializes an empty list `lis`.
The function then splits the string `s` by spaces and iterates over each element.
For each element in the split string, the function checks if it is a digit using `isdigit()`.
If the element is a digit, it is converted to an integer and appended to the list `lis`. In this case, the digits are 5 and 6.
After the loop, the function calculates the sum of the integers in `lis`, which is 5 + 6 = 11.
The function then returns `n - sum(lis)`, which is 19 - 11 = 8.
