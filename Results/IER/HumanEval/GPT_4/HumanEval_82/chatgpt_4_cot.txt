<<<Analysis>>>
The function prime_length is called with the string 'Hello'.
The length of the string 'Hello' is calculated and stored in the variable l, which is 5.
The function checks if l is 0 or 1, which it is not, so it continues.
The function then enters a loop that checks if l has any divisors other than 1 and itself. It does this by iterating from 2 to l-1 (which is 4 in this case) and checking if l is divisible by any of these numbers.
Since 5 is a prime number and has no divisors other than 1 and itself, the loop completes without returning False.
After the loop, the function returns True, indicating that the length of the string is a prime number.
