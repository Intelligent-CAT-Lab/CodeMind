<<<Analysis>>>
The function `separate_paren_groups` takes a string `paren_string` as input and returns a list of strings, where each string is a group of balanced parentheses.

1. The input string is `'(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'`.
2. The function initializes an empty list `result` and an empty list `current_string` to keep track of the current group of parentheses.
3. It also initializes a variable `current_depth` to 0 to keep track of the depth of nested parentheses.
4. The function then iterates over each character `c` in the input string.
5. For each character:
   - If `c` is `'('`, it increments `current_depth` by 1 and appends `c` to `current_string`.
   - If `c` is `')'`, it decrements `current_depth` by 1 and appends `c` to `current_string`.
   - If after appending `c` the `current_depth` is 0, it means a balanced group of parentheses has been found. The function then joins `current_string` into a single string and appends it to `result`. It then clears `current_string` for the next group.
6. The process repeats until all characters in the input string have been processed.
7. The function returns the `result` list.

For the given input, the function will process as follows:
- It finds the first group `'(()())'` and appends it to `result`.
- It finds the second group `'((()))'` and appends it to `result`.
- It finds the third group `'()'` and appends it to `result`.
- It finds the fourth group `'((())()())'` and appends it to `result`.
- The final `result` list will contain these four strings.

<<<Output>>>
['(()())', '((()))', '()', '((())()())']
