<<<Analysis>>>
The function `by_length` takes a list `arr` as input.
The dictionary `dic` maps integers from 1 to 9 to their corresponding English words.
The input list `arr` is sorted in reverse order, resulting in `[8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]`.
A new list `new_arr` is initialized to be empty.
The function then iterates over the sorted list `sorted_arr`.
For each element `var` in `sorted_arr`, the function tries to append the corresponding word from the dictionary `dic` to `new_arr`.
If the element is not in the dictionary (which is not the case here since all elements are between 1 and 9), it will pass without doing anything.
The elements 8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1 are all in the dictionary, so their corresponding words "Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One" are appended to `new_arr` in that order.
The function returns the new list `new_arr` which contains the words in descending order based on the original numbers.
<<<Output>>>
['Eight', 'Five', 'Four', 'Three', 'Two', 'Two', 'One', 'One']
