<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_numbers` takes a string of numbers spelled out in English and returns a string with those numbers sorted based on their numerical value.

The `value_map` dictionary maps the English words for numbers to their numerical equivalents.

The input string `'five zero four seven nine eight'` is split into a list of words: `['five', 'zero', 'four', 'seven', 'nine', 'eight']`.

The list comprehension `[x for x in numbers.split(' ') if x]` ensures that only non-empty strings are included in the list to be sorted. In this case, all elements are non-empty, so the list remains the same.

The `sorted` function is called with a key function that uses the `value_map` to sort the words by their numerical value. The sorting order will be based on the numerical values `[0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]`.

The sorted list of words is `['zero', 'four', 'five', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']`.

The sorted list is then joined into a single string with spaces between the words, resulting in `'zero four five seven eight nine'`.

<<<Output>>>
zero four five seven eight nine
