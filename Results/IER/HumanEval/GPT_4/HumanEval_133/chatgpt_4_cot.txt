<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_squares` takes a list `lst` as input.
The variable `squared` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the squares of the ceiling values of the elements in the list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element `i` in the list `lst`, which contains the elements [1, 2, 3].
For each element `i`, the code calculates the ceiling value of `i` using `math.ceil(i)` and then squares it.
The ceiling value of 1 is 1, and its square is 1^2 = 1.
The ceiling value of 2 is 2, and its square is 2^2 = 4.
The ceiling value of 3 is 3, and its square is 3^2 = 9.
The code adds each of these squared values to the variable `squared`.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `squared`, which is the sum of 1, 4, and 9, resulting in 14.
