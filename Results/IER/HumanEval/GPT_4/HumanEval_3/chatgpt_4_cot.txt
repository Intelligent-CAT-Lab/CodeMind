<<<Analysis>>>
The function `below_zero` takes a list of integers representing operations on a balance, which starts at 0.
The function iterates through each operation in the list and adds it to the balance.
If at any point the balance becomes negative, the function immediately returns True.
The operations are processed in the following order:
1. The balance starts at 0.
2. The first operation is 1, so the balance becomes 1.
3. The second operation is 2, so the balance becomes 3.
4. The third operation is -3, so the balance becomes 0.
5. The fourth operation is 1, so the balance becomes 1.
6. The fifth operation is 2, so the balance becomes 3.
7. The sixth operation is -3, so the balance becomes 0.
The balance never goes below zero during the processing of the operations.
Since the balance never goes below zero, the function returns False after all operations have been processed.
