<<<Analysis>>>
The function `correct_bracketing` is designed to take a string of brackets and determine if they are correctly balanced. It expects a string consisting of "<" and ">" characters. However, the input provided to the function is `10`, which is an integer, not a string of brackets.

Since the function expects a string and not an integer, calling `correct_bracketing(10)` will result in a TypeError because the function will attempt to iterate over an integer, which is not iterable.

Therefore, the code will not execute as intended and will raise an error instead of returning a boolean value.
<<<Output>>>
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
