<<<Analysis>>>
The function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer input `decimal` and converts it to a binary string.
The built-in Python function `bin()` is used to convert the decimal number to a binary string. The `bin()` function returns a string that starts with '0b', which represents that the following digits are in binary format.
The code `bin(decimal)[2:]` slices the string to remove the first two characters ('0b') to get only the binary digits.
The function then concatenates "db" at the beginning and end of the binary digits string.
For the input `decimal_to_binary(0)`, the `bin(0)` returns '0b0'.
After slicing with `[2:]`, the remaining string is '0'.
The function then adds "db" at the beginning and end, resulting in the final string "db0db".
