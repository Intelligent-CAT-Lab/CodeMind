<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_to_n` takes a single integer argument `n`.
The argument `n` is initialized to 1.
The function calculates the sum of all integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) using the `range` function and the `sum` function.
The `range(n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n`, which in this case is `range(2)` or [0, 1].
The `sum` function then adds up the numbers in the sequence, resulting in 0 + 1.
The final result, which is the sum of the sequence, is 1.
