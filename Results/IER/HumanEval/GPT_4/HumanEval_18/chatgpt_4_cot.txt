<<<Analysis>>>
The function `how_many_times` is designed to count how many times a substring appears in a given string.
The input parameters are an empty string `''` and the substring `'x'`.
The variable `times` is initialized to 0, which will hold the count of occurrences of the substring in the string.
The function enters a for loop that iterates over the range of indices in the string where the substring could start. However, since the string is empty, the range will be from 0 to -1 + 1, which simplifies to 0 to 0.
The loop condition is `range(0)`, which means the loop will not execute because there are no indices to iterate over in an empty string.
Since the loop does not execute, the value of `times` remains 0.
The function returns the value of `times`, which is 0, indicating that the substring `'x'` does not appear in the empty string.
