<<<Analysis>>>
The function `strange_sort_list` takes a list `lst` as input and initializes two variables: `res` as an empty list and `switch` as `True`.
The function enters a while loop that continues as long as `lst` is not empty.
Inside the loop, depending on the value of `switch`, either the minimum or maximum value from `lst` is appended to `res`.
After appending, the last element added to `res` (which is either the min or max from `lst`) is removed from `lst`.
The value of `switch` is toggled (flipped) at the end of each iteration.
For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the following steps occur:
1. `switch` is `True`, so `min(lst)` which is `1` is appended to `res` and removed from `lst`.
2. `switch` is now `False`, so `max(lst)` which is `4` is appended to `res` and removed from `lst`.
3. `switch` is `True` again, so `min(lst)` which is `2` is appended to `res` and removed from `lst`.
4. `switch` is now `False`, so `max(lst)` which is `3` is appended to `res` and removed from `lst`.
5. `lst` is now empty, so the loop ends.
The final `res` list is `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
