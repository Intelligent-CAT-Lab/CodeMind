<<<Analysis>>>
The function `fib` is a recursive function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of `fib(10)`:

1. `fib(10)` calls `fib(9)` and `fib(8)`.
2. `fib(9)` calls `fib(8)` and `fib(7)`.
3. This pattern continues, with each call to `fib(n)` resulting in two more calls to `fib(n-1)` and `fib(n-2)`, until it reaches the base cases of `fib(0)` and `fib(1)`.
4. The base cases return 0 and 1, respectively.
5. The recursive calls start to resolve:
   - `fib(2)` is `fib(1) + fib(0)` which is `1 + 0 = 1`.
   - `fib(3)` is `fib(2) + fib(1)` which is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `fib(4)` is `fib(3) + fib(2)` which is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - `fib(5)` is `fib(4) + fib(3)` which is `3 + 2 = 5`.
   - `fib(6)` is `fib(5) + fib(4)` which is `5 + 3 = 8`.
   - `fib(7)` is `fib(6) + fib(5)` which is `8 + 5 = 13`.
   - `fib(8)` is `fib(7) + fib(6)` which is `13 + 8 = 21`.
   - `fib(9)` is `fib(8) + fib(7)` which is `21 + 13 = 34`.
6. Finally, `fib(10)` is `fib(9) + fib(8)` which is `34 + 21 = 55`.

Therefore, the return value of `fib(10)` is 55.
