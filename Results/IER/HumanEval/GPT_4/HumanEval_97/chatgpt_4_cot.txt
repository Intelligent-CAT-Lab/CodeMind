<<<Analysis>>>
The function multiply takes two arguments, a and b, which are initialized to 148 and 412, respectively.
The function returns the product of the absolute values of the last digits of a and b.
The last digit of a (148) is 8, and the last digit of b (412) is 2.
The absolute values of these last digits are the same as the digits themselves since they are positive.
Therefore, the function returns the product of 8 and 2.
The product of 8 and 2 is 16.
