<<<Analysis>>>
The function `reverse_delete` takes two arguments, a string `s` and a string `c`. The string `s` is "abcde" and the string `c` is "ae".
The function creates a new string by joining together all characters from `s` that are not in `c`. This is done using a list comprehension that filters out any characters that are in `c`.
In this case, the characters 'a' and 'e' from "abcde" are removed, resulting in the new string "bcd".
The function then returns a tuple with two elements. The first element is the filtered string "bcd", and the second element is the result of checking if the filtered string is a palindrome (i.e., the same forwards and backwards).
Since "bcd" is not a palindrome, the second element of the tuple will be `False`.
<<<Output>>>
('bcd', False)
