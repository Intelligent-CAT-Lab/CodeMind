<<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_element` is called with the list `[1, 2, 3]`.
The variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list, which is `1`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element `e` in the list.
For each element, it checks if `e` is greater than `m`.
On the first iteration, `e` is `1`, which is not greater than `m`, so `m` remains `1`.
On the second iteration, `e` is `2`, which is greater than `m`, so `m` is updated to `2`.
On the third iteration, `e` is `3`, which is greater than `m`, so `m` is updated to `3`.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `m`, which is `3`.
