<<<Analysis>>>
The function get_row takes two arguments: lst, which is expected to be a list of lists (a 2D list), and x, which is the value to search for within the 2D list.

The function uses a list comprehension to create a list of tuples (coords), where each tuple represents the coordinates (i, j) of the element x in the 2D list. The outer loop iterates over the range of the length of lst (which represents the rows), and the inner loop iterates over the range of the length of lst[i] (which represents the columns within each row). The if condition checks if the current element lst[i][j] is equal to x.

After the list comprehension, the function returns the sorted list of coordinates. The sorting is done in two steps:
1. The inner sorted function sorts the coordinates by the second element of each tuple (j, the column index) in descending order (reverse=True).
2. The outer sorted function then sorts the resulting list by the first element of each tuple (i, the row index) in ascending order (the default sorting order).

In the case of get_row([], 1), the input lst is an empty list. This means that the list comprehension will not find any elements (since there are no elements to iterate over), and coords will be an empty list.

Since coords is empty, the sorting operations will also result in an empty list.

Therefore, the return value of get_row([], 1) will be an empty list.
