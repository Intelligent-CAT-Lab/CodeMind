<<<Analysis>>>
The function `double_the_difference` takes a list `lst` as input.
The list comprehension inside the function iterates over each element `i` in the list `lst`.
For each element `i`, the list comprehension checks three conditions:
1. `i > 0`: The element must be positive.
2. `i%2!=0`: The element must be an odd number.
3. `"." not in str(i)`: The element must not be a floating-point number (it should not contain a decimal point when converted to a string).

The input list is `[0.2, 3, 5]`.
- The first element `0.2` fails the third condition because it is a floating-point number.
- The second element `3` passes all three conditions: it is positive, odd, and not a floating-point number.
- The third element `5` also passes all three conditions: it is positive, odd, and not a floating-point number.

The list comprehension will include the squares of the elements that pass all conditions, which are `3` and `5`.
The squares are `3**2 = 9` and `5**2 = 25`.

The `sum` function then adds these squares together: `9 + 25 = 34`.

The function `double_the_difference` returns this sum, which is `34`.
