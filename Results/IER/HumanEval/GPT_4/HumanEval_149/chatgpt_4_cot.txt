<<<Analysis>>>
The variable lst is initialized to ["aa", "a", "aaa"].
The list is sorted using the sort() method, which sorts the list in place in ascending alphabetical order. The sorted list is ["a", "aa", "aaa"].
A new list called new_lst is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the sorted list.
For each string i in the sorted list, it checks if the length of the string is even by using len(i)%2 == 0.
If the length is even, the string is appended to new_lst.
The strings "aa" and "aaa" are checked. Only "aa" has an even length, so it is the only string appended to new_lst.
After the loop finishes, the new_lst contains only ["aa"].
The code returns a new list sorted by the length of the strings. Since there is only one string in new_lst, the sorted list by length is the same as new_lst.
The final returned value is ["aa"].
<<<Output>>>
["aa"]
