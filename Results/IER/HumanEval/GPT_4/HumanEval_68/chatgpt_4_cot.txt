<<<Analysis>>>
The function `pluck` is called with the argument `[4,2,3]`.
The function first checks if the length of the array `arr` is 0. If it is, it returns an empty list. In this case, the length is not 0, so it proceeds.
The variable `evens` is created by filtering `arr` to include only even numbers using a lambda function. The resulting list of even numbers from `[4,2,3]` is `[4,2]`.
The function then checks if `evens` is an empty list. If it is, it returns an empty list. In this case, `evens` is not empty, so it proceeds.
The function returns a list containing two elements: the minimum value from `evens` and the index of that minimum value in the original array `arr`.
The minimum value in `evens` is `2`, and the index of `2` in the original array `arr` is `1`.
