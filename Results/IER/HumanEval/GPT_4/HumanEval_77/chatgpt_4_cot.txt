<<<Analysis>>>
The function `iscube` takes an integer `a` as input and checks whether it is a perfect cube or not.
The input value `a` is 1.
First, the absolute value of `a` is taken, which is still 1 since 1 is positive.
The code then computes the cube root of `a` using `a ** (1. / 3)`, which is `1 ** (1. / 3)` or simply `1.0`.
This result is rounded to the nearest integer using `round`, which remains `1`.
The rounded value is then raised to the power of 3, resulting in `1 ** 3` which is `1`.
Finally, the function checks if `1 ** 3` is equal to the original `a` value, which is `1`.
Since `1` is equal to `1`, the function will return `True`, indicating that the input number is indeed a perfect cube.
<<<Output>>>
True
