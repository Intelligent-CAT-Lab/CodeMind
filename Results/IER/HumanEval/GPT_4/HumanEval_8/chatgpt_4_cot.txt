<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_product` takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and the product of the numbers in the list.
The input list is `[1, 1, 1]`.
The variable `sum_value` is initialized to 0, and `prod_value` is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates over each number in the list.
For each number `n` in the list, `sum_value` is incremented by `n` and `prod_value` is multiplied by `n`.
Since all numbers in the list are 1, the sum will be incremented by 1 three times, resulting in `sum_value` being 3.
Similarly, the product will be multiplied by 1 three times, resulting in `prod_value` being 1.
After the loop, the function returns a tuple `(sum_value, prod_value)`, which is `(3, 1)` in this case.
<<<Output>>>
(3, 1)
