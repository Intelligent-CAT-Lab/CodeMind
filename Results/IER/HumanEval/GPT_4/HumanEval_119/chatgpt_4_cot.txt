The function `match_parens` takes a list `lst` as input, which contains two strings of parentheses. The input list is `['()(', ')']`.

The function `check` is defined within `match_parens`. It takes a string `s` and checks if the parentheses in the string are properly matched. It initializes `val` to 0 and iterates over each character in the string `s`. If the character is '(', `val` is incremented by 1. If the character is ')', `val` is decremented by 1. If at any point `val` becomes negative, it means there is a closing parenthesis without a matching opening parenthesis, so the function returns `False`. If the loop finishes and `val` is 0, it means all parentheses are properly matched, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function `match_parens` then concatenates the two strings in the list in two different ways: `S1` is the first string followed by the second string, and `S2` is the second string followed by the first string. For the given input, `S1` is '()(' + ')' which results in '()()', and `S2` is ')' + '()(' which results in ')()('.

The function then checks if either `S1` or `S2` is a properly matched string of parentheses by calling the `check` function on both.

For `S1` ('()()'), the `check` function will return `True` because it is a properly matched string of parentheses.

For `S2` (')()('), the `check` function will return `False` because it starts with a closing parenthesis without a matching opening parenthesis.

Since `S1` is properly matched, the `match_parens` function will return 'Yes'.
