<<<Analysis>>>
The function `can_arrange` takes a list `arr` as input.
The variable `ind` is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the index of the element that breaks the ascending order.
The variable `i` is initialized to 1, which will be used to iterate through the list starting from the second element.
The function enters a while loop that runs as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`.
Inside the loop, the function checks if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`.
If this condition is true, it means the list is not in ascending order at this point, and `ind` is updated to the current index `i`.
The loop continues to increment `i` by 1 until the end of the list is reached.
For the input `[1,2,4,3,5]`, the loop will find that `arr[3]` (which is 3) is less than `arr[2]` (which is 4), so `ind` is updated to 3.
The loop finishes, and the function returns the value of `ind`, which is 3.
