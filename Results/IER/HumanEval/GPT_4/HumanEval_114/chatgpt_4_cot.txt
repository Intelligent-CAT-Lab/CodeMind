The function `minSubArraySum` is designed to find the minimum sum of a subarray in the given array `nums`.

1. The input array is `[2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]`.
2. `max_sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum sum of the negated subarray.
3. `s` is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the current sum of the negated subarray.
4. The function enters a loop that iterates through each number in the input array.
5. For each number `num` in the array, `s` is incremented by `-num` (the negation of the current number).
6. If `s` becomes negative, it is reset to 0, as we are looking for the maximum sum of a subarray, and a negative sum would not contribute to a maximum.
7. `max_sum` is updated to be the maximum of `s` and the current `max_sum`.
8. After the loop, if `max_sum` is still 0, it means all numbers were positive, and the minimum subarray sum is the negation of the smallest number in the array. The function finds the maximum of the negated numbers in the array and assigns it to `max_sum`.
9. Finally, `min_sum` is calculated as the negation of `max_sum` and returned.

Let's go through the loop with the given input:
- For num = 2: s = 0 - 2 = -2 (s is reset to 0 because it's negative)
- For num = 3: s = 0 - 3 = -3 (s is reset to 0 because it's negative)
- For num = 4: s = 0 - 4 = -4 (s is reset to 0 because it's negative)
- For num = 1: s = 0 - 1 = -1 (s is reset to 0 because it's negative)
- For num = 2: s = 0 - 2 = -2 (s is reset to 0 because it's negative)
- For num = 4: s = 0 - 4 = -4 (s is reset to 0 because it's negative)

Since `s` was reset to 0 after each negation, `max_sum` remains 0 throughout the loop. After the loop, since `max_sum` is 0, the function looks for the maximum of the negated numbers in the array, which are [-2, -3, -4, -1, -2, -4]. The maximum of these is -1 (since we are looking at negated values, -1 is the least negative, corresponding to the largest original value, which is 1).

Therefore, `max_sum` is set to -1, and `min_sum` is the negation of `max_sum`, which is 1.
