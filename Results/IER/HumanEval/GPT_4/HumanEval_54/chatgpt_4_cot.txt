<<<Analysis>>>
The function `same_chars` takes two string arguments, `s0` and `s1`.
The function converts both strings into sets of characters, which removes any duplicate characters and ignores the order.
For `s0`, the set will be `{'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z'}`.
For `s1`, the set will be `{'e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z'}` as well, despite the different number of occurrences and order of characters.
The function then checks if the two sets are equal.
Since both sets contain the same characters, the function will return `True`.
