<<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_by_substring` takes two parameters: a list of strings and a substring to filter by.
The input provided is an empty list `[]` and the substring `'john'`.
Since the list is empty, there are no strings to check for the presence of the substring `'john'`.
Therefore, the list comprehension `[x for x in strings if substring in x]` will not iterate over any elements and will return an empty list.
<<<Output>>>
[]
