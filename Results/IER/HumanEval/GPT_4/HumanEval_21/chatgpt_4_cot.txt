<<<Analysis>>>
The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a new list where each number has been rescaled to a unit range [0, 1].

The input list is `[2.0, 49.9]`.

First, the function finds the minimum number in the list, which is `2.0`.
Next, it finds the maximum number in the list, which is `49.9`.

The function then iterates over each number in the input list and applies the following transformation:
Each number `x` is subtracted by the minimum number and then divided by the range (max_number - min_number).

For the first number `2.0`:
- The transformed value is `(2.0 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0)`, which simplifies to `0.0 / 47.9`, resulting in `0.0`.

For the second number `49.9`:
- The transformed value is `(49.9 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0)`, which simplifies to `47.9 / 47.9`, resulting in `1.0`.

The function returns a new list with these transformed values: `[0.0, 1.0]`.

<<<Output>>>
[0.0, 1.0]
