<<<Analysis>>>
The function `string_xor` takes two binary strings `a` and `b` as input and returns a new string that is the result of the XOR operation on each corresponding pair of characters from `a` and `b`.

The function defines a nested helper function `xor` that takes two characters `i` and `j` and returns '0' if they are the same or '1' if they are different.

The main function uses a generator expression inside the `join` method. It zips the two input strings `a` and `b`, which pairs up corresponding characters from each string into tuples. For the input strings '111000' and '101010', the zipped pairs would be: ('1', '1'), ('1', '0'), ('1', '1'), ('0', '0'), ('0', '1'), and ('0', '0').

The generator expression applies the `xor` function to each pair of characters and the `join` method concatenates the results into a single string.

The XOR operation will be performed as follows:
- '1' XOR '1' = '0'
- '1' XOR '0' = '1'
- '1' XOR '1' = '0'
- '0' XOR '0' = '0'
- '0' XOR '1' = '1'
- '0' XOR '0' = '0'

Therefore, the resulting string after performing the XOR operation on each pair of characters will be '010010'.
