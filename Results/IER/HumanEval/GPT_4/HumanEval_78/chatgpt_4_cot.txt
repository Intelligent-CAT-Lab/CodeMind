<<<Analysis>>>
The function `hex_key` takes a string `num` as input and initializes a tuple `primes` containing the characters '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D', which represent prime numbers and two prime letters in hexadecimal.
The variable `total` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the occurrences of characters in `num` that are also in `primes`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the string `num`.
For each index `i`, the code checks if the character `num[i]` is in the tuple `primes`.
If the character is found in `primes`, `total` is incremented by 1.
The input string is "AB". The loop will check each character:
- 'A' is not in `primes`, so `total` remains 0.
- 'B' is in `primes`, so `total` is incremented to 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of `total`, which is 1.
