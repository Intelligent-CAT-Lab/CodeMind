<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_third` takes a list as an input and returns a new list where every third element is sorted while the rest of the elements remain in their original order.

The input list is `[1, 2, 3]`.

The function first converts the input list to a new list to avoid modifying the original list.

Then, it uses slice assignment to sort every third element of the list. The slice `l[::3]` selects every third element starting from the first element (index 0). In this case, the slice will select only the first element `[1]` because the list is too short to have more elements at positions that are multiples of 3.

The sorted list of every third element is `[1]` since there is only one element to sort, and sorting a single-element list results in the same list.

The function then returns the new list, which is `[1, 2, 3]` because only the first element was selected and it was already in sorted order.

Finally, the return value of the function is converted to a tuple by the caller, resulting in `(1, 2, 3)`.

<<<Output>>>
(1, 2, 3)
