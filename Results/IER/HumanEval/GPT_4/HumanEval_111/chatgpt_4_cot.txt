<<<Analysis>>>
The function `histogram` takes a single string argument and processes it to create a histogram in the form of a dictionary where the keys are words from the input string and the values are the number of times those words appear in the string.

1. The input string 'a b b a' is split into a list `list1` using the `split` method, resulting in `list1` being `['a', 'b', 'b', 'a']`.
2. A dictionary `dict1` is initialized to store the histogram.
3. A variable `t` is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the highest frequency of any word in the list.
4. The first `for` loop iterates over each word `i` in `list1`. For each word, it checks if the count of that word in `list1` is greater than `t` and if the word is not an empty string. If both conditions are met, `t` is updated to the count of that word. After this loop, `t` will be 2 because both 'a' and 'b' appear twice, which is the highest frequency.
5. The second `for` loop iterates over each word `i` in `list1` again. If the count of the word `i` is equal to `t`, the word and its count are added to the dictionary `dict1`. This loop ensures that only words with the highest frequency are added to the dictionary.
6. Since 'a' and 'b' both have the highest frequency of 2, they will be added to `dict1` with their respective counts.
7. The function returns `dict1`.

The expected output is a dictionary with 'a' and 'b' as keys and 2 as their corresponding values because these are the words with the highest frequency in the input string.

<<<Output>>>
{'a': 2, 'b': 2}
