<<<Analysis>>>
The function `compare` takes two lists, `game` and `guess`, as input.
The `game` list is `[1,2,3,4,5,1]` and the `guess` list is `[1,2,3,4,2,-2]`.
The function returns a new list that contains the absolute difference between corresponding elements of the `game` and `guess` lists.
The `zip` function is used to pair up elements from the two lists, resulting in pairs: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,2), and (1,-2).
The absolute differences of these pairs are calculated as follows:
- abs(1-1) = 0
- abs(2-2) = 0
- abs(3-3) = 0
- abs(4-4) = 0
- abs(5-2) = 3
- abs(1-(-2)) = abs(1+2) = 3
The resulting list of absolute differences is [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]
