<<<Analysis>>>
The function `total_match` takes two lists of strings as input, `lst1` and `lst2`.
The variable `l1` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total length of all strings in `lst1`.
The first loop iterates over each string `st` in `lst1` and adds the length of `st` to `l1`. For `lst1 = ['hi', 'admin']`, the lengths are 2 and 5, respectively, so `l1` becomes 7.
The variable `l2` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total length of all strings in `lst2`.
The second loop iterates over each string `st` in `lst2` and adds the length of `st` to `l2`. For `lst2 = ['hi', 'hi']`, the lengths are both 2, so `l2` becomes 4.
The function then checks if `l1` is less than or equal to `l2`. In this case, `l1` (7) is greater than `l2` (4), so the condition is false.
Since `l1` is not less than or equal to `l2`, the function returns `lst2`.

['hi', 'hi']
