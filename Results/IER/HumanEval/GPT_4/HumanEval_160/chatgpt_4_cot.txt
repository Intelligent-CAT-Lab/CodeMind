The function `do_algebra` takes two arguments: `operator`, which is a list of string operators, and `operand`, which is a list of numbers.
The variable `expression` is initialized with the first element of `operand` converted to a string, which is "2".
The function then enters a loop that iterates over pairs of elements from `operator` and `operand[1:]` (which excludes the first element of `operand`).
For each pair, the operator (oprt) and the operand (oprn) are concatenated to the `expression` string. The loop will perform the following concatenations:
- The first operator '**' and the second operand '3' are concatenated, resulting in the expression "2**3".
- The second operator '*' and the third operand '4' are concatenated, resulting in the expression "2**3*4".
- The third operator '+' and the fourth operand '5' are concatenated, resulting in the expression "2**3*4+5".
The final expression is "2**3*4+5", which is equivalent to "8*4+5" after evaluating the exponentiation.
The multiplication is then evaluated, resulting in "32+5".
Finally, the addition is evaluated, resulting in the number 37.
The `eval` function is used to evaluate the string expression as a Python expression.
The function returns the result of the evaluated expression, which is 37.
