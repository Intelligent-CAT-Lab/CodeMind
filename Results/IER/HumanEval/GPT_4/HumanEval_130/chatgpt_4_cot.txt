<<<Analysis>>>
The function `tri` is designed to generate a list of numbers based on a specific pattern. The input `n` is 3.

1. The function checks if `n` is 0. If it is, it returns a list containing only the number 1. Since `n` is 3, this condition is not met, and the function proceeds to the next step.

2. The list `my_tri` is initialized with the first two elements [1, 3].

3. A for loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n` (inclusive), which means it will iterate for the values 2 and 3.

4. For `i = 2`, the condition `i % 2 == 0` is true (since 2 is even), so the code appends `i / 2 + 1` to `my_tri`. This results in `2 / 2 + 1 = 2`, so the list now becomes [1, 3, 2].

5. For `i = 3`, the condition `i % 2 == 0` is false (since 3 is odd), so the code appends `my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2` to `my_tri`. This results in `my_tri[2] + my_tri[1] + (3 + 3) / 2 = 2 + 3 + 3`, so the list now becomes [1, 3, 2, 8].

6. The loop ends as it has reached `n`, and the function returns the list `my_tri`.

Therefore, the return value of `tri(3)` is [1, 3, 2, 8].
