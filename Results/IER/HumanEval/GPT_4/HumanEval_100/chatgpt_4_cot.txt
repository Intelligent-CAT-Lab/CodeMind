<<<Analysis>>>
The function `make_a_pile` takes a single argument `n`, which is initialized to 3.
The function returns a list comprehension that generates a list of numbers. Each number is calculated by taking the initial value `n` and adding `2*i` to it, where `i` is the current index in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
The range in the list comprehension will generate indices [0, 1, 2] since `n` is 3.
For each index `i`, the expression `n + 2*i` will be evaluated as follows:
- When `i` is 0, `n + 2*i` is `3 + 2*0` which equals 3.
- When `i` is 1, `n + 2*i` is `3 + 2*1` which equals 5.
- When `i` is 2, `n + 2*i` is `3 + 2*2` which equals 7.
The resulting list will be [3, 5, 7].

[3, 5, 7]
