The function `largest_divisor` is designed to find the largest divisor of a given integer `n` that is less than `n` itself.
The input to the function is the integer 3.
The function starts a loop in reverse order from `n-1` to 1 (since range in Python is exclusive of the end value).
It checks if `n` is divisible by `i` without any remainder using the modulo operator `%`.
The loop starts with `i` equal to 2 (since `range(3)` would give us [0, 1, 2] and `reversed(range(3))` gives us [2, 1, 0]).
The first check is `3 % 2`, which is not equal to 0, so the loop continues.
The next value of `i` is 1.
The check is `3 % 1`, which is equal to 0, so the condition is satisfied.
The function returns the current value of `i`, which is 1.
Therefore, the largest divisor of 3, other than itself, is 1.
