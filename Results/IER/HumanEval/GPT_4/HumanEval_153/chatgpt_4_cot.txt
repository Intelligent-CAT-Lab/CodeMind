<<<Analysis>>>
The function `Strongest_Extension` takes two arguments: `class_name` which is a string, and `extensions` which is a list of strings.

1. The variable `strong` is initialized to the first element of the `extensions` list, which is 'tEN'.
2. The variable `my_val` is calculated as the difference between the count of uppercase alphabetic characters and the count of lowercase alphabetic characters in the first element of the `extensions` list. For 'tEN', there are 2 uppercase characters ('E', 'N') and 1 lowercase character ('t'), so `my_val` is 2 - 1 = 1.
3. The code then enters a loop that iterates over each string in the `extensions` list.
4. For each string `s` in `extensions`, it calculates the value `val` in the same way as `my_val`, by finding the difference between the count of uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters.
5. If `val` is greater than `my_val`, it updates `strong` to the current string `s` and `my_val` to the current `val`.
6. For 'niNE', there are 2 uppercase characters ('N', 'E') and 2 lowercase characters ('n', 'i'), so `val` is 2 - 2 = 0. This is not greater than `my_val`, so no update is made.
7. For 'eIGHt8OKe', there are 5 uppercase characters ('I', 'G', 'H', 'O', 'K') and 2 lowercase characters ('e', 'e'), so `val` is 5 - 2 = 3. This is greater than `my_val`, so `strong` is updated to 'eIGHt8OKe' and `my_val` to 3.
8. After the loop, the function concatenates `class_name` with the strongest extension found, separated by a dot.
9. The final answer is 'Watashi.eIGHt8OKe'.
