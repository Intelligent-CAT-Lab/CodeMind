<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_dict_case` is called with a dictionary `{"p":"pineapple", "b":"banana"}` as its argument.
The function first checks if the dictionary is empty. Since it is not, the function proceeds to the else block.
The variable `state` is initialized to "start".
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the keys of the dictionary.
The first key is "p", which is a string and is lowercase. Since `state` is "start", it is set to "lower".
The loop continues to the next key, which is "b". It is also a string and is lowercase. Since `state` is "lower" and "b" is lowercase, the loop continues without changing the state.
There are no more keys in the dictionary, so the loop ends.
The function returns whether `state` is equal to "upper" or "lower". Since `state` is "lower", the function returns True.

True
