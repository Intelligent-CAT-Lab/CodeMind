<<<Analysis>>>
The function `anti_shuffle` takes a string `s` as input.
The input string `s` is "Hi".
The function splits the input string by spaces using `s.split(' ')`, which results in a list of words. Since there is only one word "Hi", the list will contain just one element ["Hi"].
For each word in the list, it converts the word into a list of characters, sorts the characters alphabetically, and then joins them back into a string. In this case, the word "Hi" is converted to ['H', 'i'], sorted to ['H', 'i'] (since uppercase letters come before lowercase in ASCII), and then joined back to "Hi".
The sorted words are then joined back into a single string with spaces in between. Since there is only one word, no additional spaces are added.
The final result is "Hi", which is the sorted version of the input string.
<<<Output>>>
Hi
