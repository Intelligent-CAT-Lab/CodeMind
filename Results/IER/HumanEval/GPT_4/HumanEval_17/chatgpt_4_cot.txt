<<<Analysis>>>
The function `parse_music` takes a single string argument `music_string` and returns a list of integers.
The `note_map` dictionary maps musical note symbols to their respective durations in some unit.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the result of `music_string.split(' ')`. This splits the input string into a list of substrings using a space as the delimiter.
Since the input is an empty string, splitting it by space will result in a list containing one empty string element.
The list comprehension includes an `if x` condition, which filters out any empty strings.
Since the only element in the split list is an empty string, it will be filtered out, and the list comprehension will return an empty list.
