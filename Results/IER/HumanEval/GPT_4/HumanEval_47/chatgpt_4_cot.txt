<<<Analysis>>>
The function `median` is designed to calculate the median of a list of numbers.
The input list `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]` is first sorted, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
The length of the sorted list is 5, which is an odd number.
Since the length is odd, the code returns the middle element of the sorted list, which is at index `len(l) // 2`, which is `5 // 2` equal to `2`.
The element at index 2 of the sorted list is `3`.
Therefore, the median of the list is `3`.
