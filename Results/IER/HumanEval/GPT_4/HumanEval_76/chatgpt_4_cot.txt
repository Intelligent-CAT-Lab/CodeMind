<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_simple_power` is designed to check if the number `x` is a power of `n`. The input values are `x = 16` and `n = 2`.

1. The function first checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, it returns whether `x` is also equal to 1. In this case, `n` is not 1, so the function proceeds to the next step.

2. The variable `power` is initialized to 1. This variable will be used to store the successive powers of `n`.

3. The function enters a while loop that continues as long as `power` is less than `x`. In each iteration, `power` is multiplied by `n`.

4. The loop runs as follows:
   - First iteration: `power` is 1, `power` becomes `1 * 2 = 2`.
   - Second iteration: `power` is 2, `power` becomes `2 * 2 = 4`.
   - Third iteration: `power` is 4, `power` becomes `4 * 2 = 8`.
   - Fourth iteration: `power` is 8, `power` becomes `8 * 2 = 16`.

5. After the fourth iteration, `power` is equal to `x` (16), so the loop stops.

6. The function returns whether `power` is equal to `x`. Since they are equal, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the return value of `is_simple_power(16, 2)` is `True`.
