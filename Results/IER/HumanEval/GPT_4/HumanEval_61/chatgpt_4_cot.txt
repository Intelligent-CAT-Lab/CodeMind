<<<Analysis>>>
The function `correct_bracketing` is designed to take a string of brackets and determine if they are correctly bracketed. The input provided `1` is not a string, but an integer, which will cause the function to raise a TypeError when it attempts to iterate over the integer as if it were a string. Therefore, the function will not return a value but will instead result in an error.
<<<Output>>>
TypeError
