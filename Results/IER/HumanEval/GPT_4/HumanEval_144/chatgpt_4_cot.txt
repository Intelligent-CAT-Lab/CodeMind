<<<Analysis>>>
The function `simplify` takes two strings representing fractions, `x` and `n`.
The strings are split into numerators and denominators using the split method on the "/" character.
For `x = "1/5"`, `a` becomes "1" and `b` becomes "5".
For `n = "5/1"`, `c` becomes "5" and `d` becomes "1".
The numerators and denominators are then converted to integers and multiplied together to get a new numerator and denominator.
The new numerator is `int(a) * int(c)` which is `1 * 5` equal to `5`.
The new denominator is `int(b) * int(d)` which is `5 * 1` equal to `5`.
The function then checks if the division of the new numerator by the new denominator is an integer.
Since `5 / 5` equals `1`, which is an integer, the condition is true.
Therefore, the function will return `True`.
