The variable n is initialized to 5.
The list A is created using a list comprehension, where each element is calculated by the formula i*i - i + 1 for i ranging from 1 to n (inclusive). This results in A = [1, 3, 7, 13, 21].
The variable ans is initialized to an empty list, which will store the triples (A[i], A[j], A[k]) that satisfy the condition.
The code then enters a triple nested loop to consider all possible triples (i, j, k) where i < j < k and i, j, k are indices in the range from 0 to n-1 (since Python uses 0-based indexing).
For each triple, it checks if the sum of the corresponding elements from list A is divisible by 3. If it is, the triple is added to the ans list.
The outer loop runs from i = 0 to i = n-1 (4 in this case), the middle loop runs from j = i+1 to n-1, and the inner loop runs from k = j+1 to n-1.
The possible triples (i, j, k) are (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4), and (2, 3, 4).
The sums of the corresponding elements from A for these triples are 11, 17, 25, 23, 31, 39, 23, 31, 39, and 41, respectively.
Only the sums 11 and 39 are divisible by 3, so the triples (A[0], A[1], A[2]) = (1, 3, 7) and (A[0], A[3], A[4]) = (1, 13, 21) are added to ans.
Finally, the function returns the length of ans, which is 2, as there are two triples that satisfy the condition.
