<<<Analysis>>>
The function `digitSum` takes a string `s` as input and returns the sum of the ASCII values of the uppercase letters in the string.
The input string is "You arE Very Smart".
The function checks if the string is empty, and since it's not, it proceeds to the return statement.
The return statement uses a generator expression to iterate over each character in the string.
For each character, the expression checks if the character is an uppercase letter using `char.isupper()`.
If the character is uppercase, the ASCII value of the character is added to the sum using `ord(char)`.
If the character is not uppercase, 0 is added to the sum (which effectively does nothing).
The uppercase letters in the string are "Y", "E", "V", "S", and "M".
The ASCII values of these characters are 89 for "Y", 69 for "E", 86 for "V", 83 for "S", and 77 for "M".
The sum of these ASCII values is 89 + 69 + 86 + 83 + 77 = 404.
Therefore, the function will return 404.
