<<<Analysis>>>
The function `numerical_letter_grade` takes a list of grade point averages (GPAs) and converts them to letter grades based on the GPA value. The input list is `[4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]`.

The function initializes an empty list `letter_grade` to store the letter grades corresponding to each GPA in the input list.

The function then iterates over each GPA in the input list and checks it against a series of conditions to determine the appropriate letter grade:

1. For the first GPA, 4.0, the condition `gpa == 4.0` is true, so "A+" is appended to `letter_grade`.
2. For the second GPA, 3, the condition `gpa > 3.0` is true, so "B+" is appended to `letter_grade`.
3. For the third GPA, 1.7, the condition `gpa > 1.7` is false, but `gpa > 1.3` is true, so "C-" is appended to `letter_grade`.
4. For the fourth GPA, 2, the condition `gpa > 2.0` is true, so "C+" is appended to `letter_grade`.
5. For the fifth GPA, 3.5, the condition `gpa > 3.3` is true, so "A-" is appended to `letter_grade`.

After iterating through all the GPAs, the function returns the `letter_grade` list with the corresponding letter grades for each GPA.

<<<Output>>>
["A+", "B+", "C-", "C+", "A-"]
