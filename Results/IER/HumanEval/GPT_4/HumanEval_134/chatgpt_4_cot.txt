<<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a single string argument `txt`.
The variable `txt` is initialized to "apple".
The code splits the string `txt` by spaces using `txt.split(' ')` and takes the last element of the resulting list with `[-1]`. Since "apple" does not contain any spaces, the last element is the entire string "apple".
The variable `check` is then initialized to "apple".
The function then checks if the length of `check` is 1 and if the ASCII value of the lowercase version of `check` is between 97 and 122 (inclusive), which corresponds to the range of lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'.
Since the length of "apple" is not 1, the condition is not met.
Therefore, the function will return `False`.
