<<<Analysis>>>
The function `common` takes two lists as input and returns a sorted list of the common elements between them.
- The lists provided as input are `[1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5]` and `[5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]`.
- A set `ret` is initialized to store the common elements without duplicates.
- The function enters a nested loop where each element of the first list (`l1`) is compared with each element of the second list (`l2`).
- If an element from `l1` is found in `l2`, it is added to the set `ret`.
- The common elements found are `1`, `5`, and `653`. These are added to the set `ret`.
- Since sets do not have duplicates, even though `5` appears twice in the second list, it is only added once to the set.
- After the loop finishes, the set `ret` contains `{1, 5, 653}`.
- The set is then converted to a list and sorted, resulting in `[1, 5, 653]`.
- This sorted list is returned by the function.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 653]
