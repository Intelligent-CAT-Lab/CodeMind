<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 50.
An empty list ns is created to store numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (49 in this case).
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 11 or 13.
If i is divisible by 11 or 13, it is appended to the list ns.
The numbers divisible by 11 or 13 up to 49 are: 0, 11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, and 44.
The list ns is then converted to a string '011132226333944' by joining each element as a string.
A variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the occurrences of the character '7'.
The code iterates over each character in the string '011132226333944'.
For each character c, it increments ans by 1 if c is '7'.
There are no '7's in the string, so ans remains 0.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ans, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
