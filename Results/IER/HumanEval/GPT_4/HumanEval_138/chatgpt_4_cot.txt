<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` takes a single argument `n`.
The function returns `True` if two conditions are met:
1. `n` is even, which is checked by `n%2 == 0`.
2. `n` is greater than or equal to 8, which is checked by `n >= 8`.

For the input `is_equal_to_sum_even(4)`:
- The first condition checks if 4 is even. Since 4 % 2 equals 0, the first condition is `True`.
- The second condition checks if 4 is greater than or equal to 8. Since 4 is less than 8, the second condition is `False`.

Since both conditions must be true for the function to return `True`, and the second condition is `False`, the function will return `False` for the input 4.
