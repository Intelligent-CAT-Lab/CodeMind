<<<Analysis>>>
The function `encode` is designed to swap the case of each character in the input message and then replace vowels with the character that is two positions ahead in the ASCII table.

1. The variable `vowels` is initialized with a string containing all lowercase and uppercase vowels.
2. A dictionary `vowels_replace` is created using a list comprehension and the `dict` constructor. This dictionary maps each vowel to the character two positions ahead in the ASCII table. For example, 'a' maps to 'c', 'A' maps to 'C', etc.
3. The input message 'TEST' is then converted to its swapped case, which results in 'test'.
4. The function then iterates over each character in the swapped case message and checks if it is a vowel. If it is, it replaces the character with the corresponding character from the `vowels_replace` dictionary. If it is not a vowel, it keeps the character as is.
5. Since 'test' contains no vowels after the case swap, no characters are replaced.
6. The function returns the final string, which is 'test' after the case swap and no vowel replacements.
