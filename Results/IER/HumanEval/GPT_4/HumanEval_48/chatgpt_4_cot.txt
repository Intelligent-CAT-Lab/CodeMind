The function `is_palindrome` is designed to check if the input string `text` is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward.

The input string 'xywyx' is passed to the function.

The function starts a loop that iterates over the length of the text. In this case, the length of 'xywyx' is 5, so the loop will iterate 5 times with `i` taking values from 0 to 4.

During each iteration, the function compares the character at the current index `i` with the character at the mirrored index from the end of the string, which is `len(text) - 1 - i`.

Here's the step-by-step comparison:
- For i = 0, text[0] is 'x' and text[4] is 'x'. They are equal.
- For i = 1, text[1] is 'y' and text[3] is 'y'. They are equal.
- For i = 2, text[2] is 'w' and text[2] is 'w'. They are equal.
- The loop continues, but since the string is odd in length, the middle character does not need to be compared with any other character.

Since all corresponding characters match, the function never returns False and completes the loop.

After the loop, the function returns True, indicating that 'xywyx' is indeed a palindrome.
