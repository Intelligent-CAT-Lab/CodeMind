<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized to 7.
The variables even_count and odd_count are initialized to 0.
The code converts the absolute value of num to a string and iterates over each character (digit) in the string.
Since num is 7, the absolute value is 7, and the string representation is '7'.
There is only one digit in the string, which is '7'.
The code checks if the digit is even or odd by taking the integer value of the digit and checking if it is divisible by 2.
Since 7 is not divisible by 2, it is odd, so odd_count is incremented by 1.
The loop ends as there are no more digits.
The function returns a tuple with the counts of even and odd digits, which are 0 and 1, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
(0, 1)
