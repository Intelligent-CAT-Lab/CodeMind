Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    res, switch = [], True
    while lst:
        res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst))
        lst.remove(res[-1])
        switch = not switch
    return res

<Code>

What would be the return value of `strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable lst is initialized to [1, 2, 3, 4].
The variable res is initialized to [], which will be used to store the result.
The variable switch is initialized to True.
The code enters a while loop that iterates until lst is empty.
The code appends the minimum value of lst to res if switch is True, otherwise appends the maximum value of lst to res.
The code then removes the last element of res from lst.
The code then switches the value of switch.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of res, which is [1, 3, 2, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 2, 4]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_digits(N):
    sum_1 = 0
    while N > 0:
        sum_1 += N % 10
        N = N // 10
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_digits(12345)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 12345.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of digits.
The code enters a while loop that iterates until N is not 0.
The code adds the last digit of N to sum_1.
The code then divides N by 10 to get the next digit.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
