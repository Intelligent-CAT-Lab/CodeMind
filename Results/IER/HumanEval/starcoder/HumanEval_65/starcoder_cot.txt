Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
        return s[::-1]
    else:
        return s[len(s) - shift:] + s[:len(s) - shift]

<Code>

What would be the return value of `circular_shift(100, 2) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 100, and variable shift is initialized to 2.
The code converts x to a string and stores it in s.
The code checks if shift is greater than the length of s. If it is, it returns the reversed string of s.
Otherwise, it returns the string s with the first shift characters removed and the rest of the string added to the end.
<<<Output>>>
01

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_palindrome(s):
    if len(s) <= 1:
        return True
    else:
        return s[0] == s[-1] and is_palindrome(s[1:-1])

<Code>

What would be the return value of `is_palindrome("racecar")`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to "racecar".
The code checks if the length of s is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it returns True.
Otherwise, it returns the value of the expression s[0] == s[-1] and is_palindrome(s[1:-1]), which is True and is_palindrome("racecar")[1:-1], which is is_palindrome("racce").
<<<Output>>>
True
