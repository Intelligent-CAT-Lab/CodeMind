Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

What would be the return value of `skjkasdkd([0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable lst is initialized to [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3], which is a list of integers.
The function isPrime is defined to check if a number is prime or not.
The variable maxx is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum value of the list.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used to iterate through the list.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than the length of the list.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the current value of lst[i] is greater than maxx and if the current value of lst[i] is prime. If both conditions are met, the current value of lst[i] is assigned to maxx.
The code increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the sum of the digits of maxx and stores it in result.
The code returns the final value of result, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
