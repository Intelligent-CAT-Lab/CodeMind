Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_max_triples(n):
    A = [i*i - i + 1 for i in range(1,n+1)]
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1,n):
            for k in range(j+1,n):
                if (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0:
                    ans += [(A[i],A[j],A[k])]
    return len(ans)

<Code>

What would be the return value of `get_max_triples(5) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code creates a list A, which contains the first n numbers in the sequence.
The code then creates a list ans, which will be used to store the triples that meet the condition.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each i in this range, the code enters another loop that iterates from i+1 to n-1.
For each j in this range, the code enters another loop that iterates from j+1 to n-1.
For each k in this range, the code checks if (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0. If it is, it adds the triple (A[i],A[j],A[k]) to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the length of ans, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
