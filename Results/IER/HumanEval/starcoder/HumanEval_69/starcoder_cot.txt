Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def search(lst):
    frq = [0] * (max(lst) + 1)
    for i in lst:
        frq[i] += 1;

    ans = -1
    for i in range(1, len(frq)):
        if frq[i] >= i:
            ans = i
    
    return ans

<Code>

What would be the return value of `search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1]) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable lst is initialized to [5, 5, 5, 5, 1], which is a list of integers.
The variable frq is initialized to a list of 6 elements, all of which are initialized to 0.
The variable ans is initialized to -1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of lst.
For each element i in lst, it increments the corresponding element of frq by 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the elements of frq.
For each element i in frq, it checks if the element is greater than or equal to i.
If the element is greater than or equal to i, it updates ans to i.
The code then returns the final value of ans, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
