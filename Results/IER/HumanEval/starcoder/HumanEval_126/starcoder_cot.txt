Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_sorted(lst):
    count_digit = dict([(i, 0) for i in lst])
    for i in lst:
        count_digit[i]+=1 
    if any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst):
        return False
    if all(lst[i-1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst))):
        return True
    else:
        return False
    
    

<Code>

What would be the return value of `is_sorted([5]) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable lst is initialized to [5].
The code creates a dictionary count_digit, which is a mapping from each digit in lst to the number of times it appears in lst.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in lst.
For each element i in lst, it increments the count of i in count_digit by 1.
The code then checks if any of the values in count_digit is greater than 2.
If any of the values in count_digit is greater than 2, the code returns False.
The code then checks if all the values in lst are in ascending order.
If all the values in lst are in ascending order, the code returns True.
If the values in lst are not in ascending order, the code returns False.
<<<Output>>>
True
