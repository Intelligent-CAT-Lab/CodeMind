Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

What would be the return value of `check_dict_case({"p":"pineapple", "b":"banana"}) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable dict is initialized to {"p":"pineapple", "b":"banana"}.
The code checks if the length of the keys in the dictionary is 0.
If it is, it returns False.
Otherwise, it enters a loop that iterates through the keys in the dictionary.
For each key, it checks if the key is a string. If it is not, it sets the state to "mixed" and breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it checks if the state is "start". If it is, it checks if the key is upper case. If it is, it sets the state to "upper". If it is not, it checks if the key is lower case. If it is, it sets the state to "lower". If it is not, it sets the state to "mixed" and breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it checks if the state is "upper" or "lower". If it is, it checks if the key is upper case or lower case. If it is not, it sets the state to "mixed" and breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it checks if the state is "upper" or "lower". If it is, it checks if the key is upper case or lower case. If it is not, it sets the state to "mixed" and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the state is "upper" or "lower". If it is, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
