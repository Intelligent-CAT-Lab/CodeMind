Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def select_words(s, n):
    result = []
    for word in s.split():
        n_consonants = 0
        for i in range(0, len(word)):
            if word[i].lower() not in ["a","e","i","o","u"]:
                n_consonants += 1 
        if n_consonants == n:
            result.append(word)
    return result

What would be the return value of `select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to "Mary had a little lamb", and variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable result is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the words in s.split(), which is ["Mary", "had", "a", "little", "lamb"].
For each word in this list, it calculates the number of consonants in the word and stores it in n_consonants.
The code checks if n_consonants is equal to n, which is 4 in this case. If it is, it adds the current word to result. The condition is met when word is "Mary", "had", "a", "little".
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of result, which is ["Mary", "had", "a", "little"].
<<<Output>>>
["Mary", "had", "a", "little"]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_squares(N):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_1 += i**2
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_squares(20)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 20.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates i**2 and adds it to sum_1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 285.
<<<Output>>>
285
