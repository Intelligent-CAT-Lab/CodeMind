Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>

    l = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])
    r = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])
    length = r - l
    if length > 0 and is_prime(length):
        return "YES"
    return "NO"

What would be the return value of `intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_prime is defined to check if a number is prime.
The function intersection takes two intervals as input and returns "YES" if the two intervals intersect and "NO" if they do not.
The function first finds the maximum of the two intervals and stores it in l.
The function then finds the minimum of the two intervals and stores it in r.
The function then calculates the length of the intersection of the two intervals, which is r - l.
The function then checks if the length is greater than 0 and if it is prime.
If the length is greater than 0 and prime, the function returns "YES".
If the length is not greater than 0 or not prime, the function returns "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO

<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_prime is defined to check if a number is prime.
The function sum_of_primes takes a number N as input and returns the sum of all prime numbers less than or equal to N.
The function first initializes the variable sum_1 to 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is prime. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19.
