Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

What would be the return value of `valid_date('03-11-2000') `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function valid_date takes a string as input and returns a boolean value.
The function first strips the input string of any leading or trailing spaces.
The function then splits the input string into three parts: month, day and year.
The function then converts the three parts into integers.
The function then checks if the month is within the range [1, 12].
The function then checks if the day is within the range [1, 31] based on the month.
The function then checks if the year is within the range [1, 2999].
If any of the checks fail, the function returns False.
If all checks pass, the function returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True

</Code>
What would be the return value of `is_prime(100)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_prime takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value.
The function first checks if the input is 1. If it is, the function returns False.
The function then checks if the input is divisible by any number between 2 and n (inclusive). If it is, the function returns False.
If the input is not 1 and is not divisible by any number between 2 and n (inclusive), the function returns True.
<<<Output>>>
False
