Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    note_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
    return [note_map[x] for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]

<Code>

What would be the return value of `parse_music('') `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable music_string is initialized to an empty string.
The variable note_map is initialized to a dictionary with keys 'o' and 'o|' and values 4 and 2, respectively.
The code then splits the music_string into a list of strings, where each string is a note.
The code then iterates through the list of strings, and for each string x, it checks if x is in the note_map.
If x is in the note_map, the code appends the value of note_map[x] to the list of notes.
The code then returns the list of notes.
<<<Output>>>
