Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:

What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

What would be the return value of `even_odd_palindrome(123) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 123.
The function is_palindrome is defined to check if a number is a palindrome.
The function even_odd_palindrome is defined to count the number of even and odd palindromes in the range [1, n].
The function even_odd_palindrome calls the function is_palindrome to check if a number is a palindrome.
The function even_odd_palindrome enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 123.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is an odd number and if it is a palindrome. If it is, it adds 1 to the variable odd_palindrome_count.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is an even number and if it is a palindrome. If it is, it adds 1 to the variable even_palindrome_count.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final values of even_palindrome_count and odd_palindrome_count, which are 10 and 11, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
(10, 11)

The variable n is initialized to 123456789.
The function sum_of_digits is defined to calculate the sum of the digits of a number.
The function sum_of_digits enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 8.
For each number i in this range, it adds the current digit to the
