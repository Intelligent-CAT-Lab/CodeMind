Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def prime_length(string):
    l = len(string)
    if l == 0 or l == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, l):
        if l % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

<Code>

What would be the return value of `prime_length('Hello') `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable string is initialized to 'Hello'.
The code checks if the length of string is 0 or 1. If it is, it returns False.
Otherwise, it enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the length of string (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the length of string is divisible by i. If it is, it returns False.
After the loop finishes, it returns True.
<<<Output>>>
False

def sum_of_digits(N):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        sum_1 += sum_order
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_digits(20)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 20.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 110.
<<<Output>>>
110
