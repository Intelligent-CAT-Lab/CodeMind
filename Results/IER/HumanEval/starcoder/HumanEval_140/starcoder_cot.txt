Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:

    while i < len(text):
        if text[i] == " ":

        else:
            if end - start > 2:
                new_text += "-"+text[i]
            elif end - start > 0:
                new_text += "_"*(end - start)+text[i]
            else:
                new_text += text[i]
            start, end = i+1, i+1
        i+=1
    if end - start > 2:
        new_text += "-"
    elif end - start > 0:
        new_text += "_"
    return new_text

What would be the return value of `fix_spaces("Example") `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to "Example".
The variable new_text is initialized to "", which will be used to store the output.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used to iterate through the string.
The variable start and end are initialized to 0, which will be used to store the starting and ending indices of the spaces.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than the length of the string.
The code checks if the current character is a space. If it is, it increases end by 1.
If the current character is not a space, it checks if end - start is greater than 2. If it is, it adds a hyphen to new_text and adds the current character to new_text.
If end - start is greater than 0, it adds a number of underscores equal to end - start to new_text and adds the current character to new_text.
If end - start is 0, it adds the current character to new_text.
It then increases start and end by 1.
The code checks if end - start is greater than 2. If it is, it adds a hyphen to new_text.
If end - start is greater than 0, it adds a number of underscores equal to end - start to new_text.
If end - start is 0, it does nothing.
The code then returns the final value of new_text, which is "Ex_amp_le".
<<<Output>>>
Ex_amp_le
