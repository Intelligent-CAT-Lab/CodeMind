Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:

def count_nums(arr):
    def digits_sum(n):
        neg = 1
        if n < 0: n, neg = -1 * n, -1 
        n = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
        n[0] = n[0] * neg
        return sum(n)
    return len(list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, [digits_sum(i) for i in arr])))

What would be the return value of `count_nums([1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5]) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5].
The function digits_sum is defined to calculate the sum of the digits of a number.
The function count_nums is defined to count the number of positive numbers in the array arr.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the array arr.
For each number i in the array, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is positive. If it is, it adds 1 to the count. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4,5.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of count, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
