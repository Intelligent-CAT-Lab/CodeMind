Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    closest_pair = None
    distance = None

    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx!= idx2:
                if distance is None:
                    distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                    closest_pair = tuple(sorted([elem, elem2]))
                else:
                    new_distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                    if new_distance < distance:
                        distance = new_distance
                        closest_pair = tuple(sorted([elem, elem2]))

    return closest_pair

<Code>

What would be the return value of `find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable numbers is initialized to [1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2].
The code enters a loop that iterates over the numbers list.
For each number elem in the list, it enters another loop that iterates over the numbers list again.
For each number elem2 in the list, it checks if the current number elem is not equal to the current number elem2.
If the two numbers are not equal, it calculates the absolute difference between the two numbers and stores it in new_distance.
If the new_distance is less than the current distance, it updates the distance to the new_distance and updates the closest_pair to the tuple of the two numbers.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of closest_pair, which is (2.0, 2.2).
<<<Output>>>
(2.0, 2.2)
