Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def pluck(arr):
    if(len(arr) == 0): return []
    evens = list(filter(lambda x: x%2 == 0, arr))
    if(evens == []): return []
    return [min(evens), arr.index(min(evens))]

<Code>

What would be the return value of `pluck([4,2,3]) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [4,2,3].
The code checks if the length of arr is 0. If it is, it returns an empty list.
The code then checks if evens is an empty list. If it is, it returns an empty list.
The code then returns the minimum value of evens and the index of the minimum value of evens.
<<<Output>>>
[2,1]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_digits(n):
    sum_1 = 0
    while n > 0:
        sum_1 += n % 10
        n = n // 10
    return sum_1

<Code>

What would be the return value of `sum_of_digits(123)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 123.
The code enters a while loop that iterates as long as n is greater than 0.
The code adds the last digit of n to sum_1 and then divides n by 10 to get the next digit.
The code exits the loop when n is 0.
The code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
