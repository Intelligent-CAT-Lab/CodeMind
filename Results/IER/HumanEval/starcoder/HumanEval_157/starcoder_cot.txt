Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    return a*a == b*b + c*c or b*b == a*a + c*c or c*c == a*a + b*b

<Code>

What would be the return value of `right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The function right_angle_triangle takes three arguments a, b, and c.
The function returns True if a right angle triangle can be formed with the given sides, and False otherwise.
The function first checks if a right angle triangle can be formed with sides a, b, and c.
The function then checks if a right angle triangle can be formed with sides b, a, and c.
The function then checks if a right angle triangle can be formed with sides c, a, and b.
The function returns True if any of the three conditions is met, and False otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
True
