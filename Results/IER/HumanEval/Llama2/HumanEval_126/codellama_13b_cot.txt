<<<Analysis>>>
The variable lst is initialized to [5, 2, 5], which is a list with three elements.
The variable count_digit is initialized to a dictionary with each element initialized to 0.
The code then iterates through the list and for each element i, it increments the count_digit[i] by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if any of the elements of count_digit is greater than 2.
Since all of them are 1, it returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_sorted(lst):
    count_digit = dict([(i, 0) for i in lst])
    for i in lst:
        count_digit[i]+=1 
    if any(count_digit[i] > 2 for i in lst):
        return False
    if all(lst[i-1] <= lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst))):
        return True
    else:
        return False
