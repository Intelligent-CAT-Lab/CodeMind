<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized to 148 and variable b is initialized to 412.
The code returns the absolute value of the product of the last digits of a and b.
The last digit of 148 is 8 and the last digit of 412 is 2.
The product of 8 and 2 is 16, which is the absolute value of the product of the last digits of a and b.
<<<Output>>>
16

Given the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integers(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1, N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0, n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
