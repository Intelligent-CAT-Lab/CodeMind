The variable nums is initialized to [1, 2, 3].
The function find_min is called with the input nums.
The function first stores the first element of the input nums, nums[0], in the variable min_num.
The function then iterates through the input nums and checks if the current element is smaller than min_num. If it is, it updates min_num to the current element.
The return value of the function is min_num, which is 1.
