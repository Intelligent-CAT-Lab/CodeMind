The variable l is a list that is passed into the function sort_even. The function first splits the list into even numbers and odd numbers. The even numbers are stored in a list named evens, and the odd numbers are stored in a list named odds. The evens list is sorted.
Then, the function iterates over the even and odd lists. For each pair of even and odd numbers, it appends the even number to the ans list. If there is an extra even number in the even list, it is appended to the ans list as the last element.
Finally, the function returns the ans list.
