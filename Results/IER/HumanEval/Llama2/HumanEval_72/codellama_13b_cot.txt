The input parameters are 3, 4 and 5.
The code first checks if the sum of numbers in the list q is greater than w.
In this case, it is not.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from i = 0 to j = len(q)-1 (inclusive).
The variable i is initially set to 0, while the variable j is set to the length of the list minus 1.
The code checks if the current value of q[i] is equal to q[j].
