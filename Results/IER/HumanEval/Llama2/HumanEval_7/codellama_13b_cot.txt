<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two parameters:
    strings: a list of strings
    substring: a string

The function returns a list of strings that contains the string substring.

In this case, the input is an empty list and the substring is 'john'.
Since there is no string in the list that contains the substring, the function returns an empty list.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integers(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integers(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes
