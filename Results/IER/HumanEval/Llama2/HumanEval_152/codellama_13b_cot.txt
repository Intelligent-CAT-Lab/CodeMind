The function `compare()` takes two lists as inputs, game and guess.
It then uses the zip() function to pair the elements of the lists, and then uses the abs() function to get the absolute difference between each pair of elements.
The final result is a list containing the absolute differences between each pair of elements.

The function is called with the input [1,2,3,4,5,1] and [1,2,3,4,2,-2].
