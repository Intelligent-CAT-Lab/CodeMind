<<<Analysis>>>
The function common() takes two lists as input, and returns a sorted list of elements that appear in both lists.
The function iterates through the first list, and for each element e1 in the list, it iterates through the second list, and checks if e1 == e2. If the condition is met, it adds e1 to a set called ret, which stores the elements that appear in both lists.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the sorted list of elements in ret, which in this case is [1, 5, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 5]
