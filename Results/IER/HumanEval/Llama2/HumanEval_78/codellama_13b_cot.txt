<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized to "AB".
The code enters a loop that iterates over each character in num.
For each character, it checks if it is in the list primes.
If it is, it increments the variable total by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of total, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
