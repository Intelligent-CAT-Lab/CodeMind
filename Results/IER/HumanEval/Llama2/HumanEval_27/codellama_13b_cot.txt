The variable string is initialized to 'Hello!'.
The code then calls the swapcase() method on the string, which returns the string with all uppercase letters converted to lowercase and vice versa.
After the method call, the code returns the string, which is 'hello!'.
<<<Output>>>
hello!

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
