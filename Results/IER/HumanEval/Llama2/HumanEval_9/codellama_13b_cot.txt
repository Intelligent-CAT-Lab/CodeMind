The variable arr is initialized to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The variable max_sum is initialized to 0.
The variable sum is initialized to 0.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which is the index of the first element in the list.
The variable j is initialized to 0, which is the index of the second element in the list.
The function enters a loop that iterates through the elements of the list arr.
For each element i in the list, it calculates the sum of all elements starting from i to the end of the list, and stores the result in sum.
If the sum is greater than max_sum, it updates max_sum with the new value.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of max_sum, which is 15.

15

Consider the following code:

<Code>
def find_max_subarray(arr: List[int]) -> int:
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        sum = 0
        for j in range(i, len(arr)):
            sum += arr[j]
            if sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = sum
    return max_sum
</Code>

What would be the return value of `find_max_subarray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the
