The variable s is initialized to "Mary had a little lamb", and variable n is initialized to 4.
The code splits the string s into a list of words.
For each word in the list, the code calculates the number of consonants and compares it to the value of n. If they are equal, it adds the word to the list result.
The condition is met when n = 4 and the word is "had".
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of result, which is ["had"].
<<<Output>>>
["had"]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def select_words(s, n):
    result = []
    for word in s.split():
        n_consonants = 0
        for i in range(0, len(word)):
            if word[i].lower() not in ["a","e","i","o","u"]:
                n_consonants +=
