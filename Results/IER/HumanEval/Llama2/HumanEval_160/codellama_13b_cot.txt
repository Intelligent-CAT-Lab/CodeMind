The input is `do_algebra(['**', '*', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 5])`

The input is a list, which contains two elements: the first element is the operator, and the second element is the operand.

The operator is a list containing two elements, which are the operator `**` and the operand `*`.

The operand is a list containing three elements, which are the operand `2`, the operator `+`, and the operand `3`.

The operator is a list containing two elements, which are the operator `*` and the operand `4`.

The operand is a list containing three elements, which are the operand `5`, the operator `+`, and the operand `5`.
