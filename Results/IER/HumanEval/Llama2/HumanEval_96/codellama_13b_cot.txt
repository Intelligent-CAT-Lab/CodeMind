The variable n is initialized to 5, which will be used to calculate the upper bound of the loop.
The variable primes is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the prime numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if i is prime by checking if there is any number j (2 <= j <= i) such that i % j == 0. If there is, the number i is not prime and the code breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, the code appends the number i to the list pr
