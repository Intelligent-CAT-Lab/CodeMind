The variable x is initialized to 16, and the variable n is initialized to 2.
The code checks if n is 1. If it is, it returns the value of x, which is 16.
Otherwise, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to x (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it calculates the power of n and stores it in power.
The code checks if power is equal to x. If it is, it returns true.
After the loop finishes, the code returns false.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    if (n == 1): 
        return (x == 1) 
    power = 1
    while (power < x): 
        power = power * n 
    return (power == x) 

<Code>

What would be the return value of `is_simple_power(16, 2)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
