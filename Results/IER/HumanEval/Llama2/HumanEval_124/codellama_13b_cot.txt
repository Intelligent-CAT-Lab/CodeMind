<<<Analysis>>>
The input is "03-11-2000".
The code first checks if the input is empty. If so, it returns False.

The input is not empty.

The code then splits the input into three parts: month, day and year.

The code checks if the month is between 1 and 12. The input is 3, which is in the range, so the condition is met.

The code then checks if the day is between 1 and 31. The input is 11, which is not in the range, so the condition is not met.

The code then checks if the year is between 2000 and 2020. The input is 2000, which is in the range, so the condition is met.

The code returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def valid_date(date):
    try:
        date = date.strip()
        month, day, year = date.split('-')
        month, day, year = int(month), int(day), int(year)
        if month < 1 or month > 12:
            return False
        if month in [1,3,5,7,8,10,12] and day < 1 or day > 31:
            return False
        if month in [4,6,9,11] and day < 1 or day > 30:
            return False
        if month == 2 and day < 1 or day > 29:
            return False
    except:
        return False

    return True

What would be the return value of `valid_date('03-11-2000') `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
