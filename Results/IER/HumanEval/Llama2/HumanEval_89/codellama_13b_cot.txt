The input is 'hi'.

The code iterates through each character in the input.

For each character, it checks if it is in the dictionary.
If it is, it takes the index of the character in the dictionary and adds 2*2 to it.
The value is then modulo 26, which is the length of the dictionary.
The character at this index in the dictionary is then added to the output.

For characters that are not in the dictionary, the original character is added to the output.

After the loop finishes, the output is returned.
