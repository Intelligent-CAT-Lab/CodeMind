<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to "racecar".
The code checks if s is equal to s[::-1].
In this case, s[::-1] is "racacer", which is equal to s. Therefore, the code returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]
</Code>
