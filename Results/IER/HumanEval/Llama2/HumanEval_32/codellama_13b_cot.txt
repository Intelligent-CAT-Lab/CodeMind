The function `find_zero` takes an integer as input and returns the value of the input that makes the function return 0.
The function `find_zero` will call the function `find_zero` with the input `10`, which is the list of numbers `10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1`.
The function `find_zero` will iterate through the range [-1, 1] and find the value of x that makes the polynomial zero.
The function will return the value of x that makes the polynomial zero.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_zero(x: int):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return 0
    if x % 3 == 0:
        return 0
    if x % 5 == 0:
        return 0
    return 1

What would be the return value of `find_zero(10) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
