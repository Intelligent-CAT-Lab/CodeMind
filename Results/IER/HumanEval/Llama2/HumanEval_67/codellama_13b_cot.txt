<<<Analysis>>>
The input is "5 apples and 6 oranges" and n = 19.
The code first splits the input into a list using the " " delimiter.
Then, it iterates over the list and checks if each element is a digit.
If it is, it appends the integer value of the element to the list lis.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the sum of the elements in lis, which is 5+6 = 11.
Finally, it returns the number 19 - 11 = 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
