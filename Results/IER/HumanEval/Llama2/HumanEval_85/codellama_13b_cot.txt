The variable A is initialized to 2, B to 3, C to 4 and D to 5.
The code first calculates the maximum of A, B, C and D, which is 5.
It then calculates the maximum of A and the maximum of B, the maximum of C and the maximum of D, which is 5.
The code finally calculates the maximum of the maximum of A and B and the maximum of C and D, which is 5.
The code returns the final value of the maximum, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def max_of_five(A, B, C, D, E):
    max_1 = max(A, B, C, D, E)
    max_2 = max(A, max(B, max(C, max(D, E))))
    max_3 = max(max_1, max_2)
    return max_3
</Code>

What would be the return value of `max_of_five(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
