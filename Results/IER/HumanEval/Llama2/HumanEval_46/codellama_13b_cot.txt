The variable n is initialized to 8.
The code first checks if n is less than 6. If it is, it returns the value of results[n], which is 5 in this case.
Otherwise, it iterates from 6 to n+1, which is 8 in this case.
For each value of i, it appends the value of results[-1] + results[-2] + results[-3] + results[-4] + results[-5] + results[-6] to results, which is 5 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 11 in this case.
The code then removes the first element of results, which is 11 in this
