<<<Analysis>>>
The input is [5, 5, 5, 5, 1].
The function `find_max` takes the input and calculates the maximum number in the list.
For each number i in the list, it checks if i is greater than the current maximum number.
If it is, the function sets the maximum number to i, which is 5 in this case.

<<<Output>>>
5
