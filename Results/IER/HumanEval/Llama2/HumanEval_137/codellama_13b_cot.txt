The variable a is initialized to 1 and the variable b is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a conditional statement that checks if both variables are strings. If either of them is a string, it replaces the comma with a dot and assigns the new values to a and b.
The code then checks if the values of a and b are equal. If they are, it returns None. Otherwise, it returns a if temp_a is greater than temp_b, or b if temp_b is greater than temp_a.
In this case, the values of a and b are not equal, so the code returns True.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def compare_four(a, b):
    if isinstance(a, str): a = a.replace(',','.')
    if isinstance(b, str): b = b.replace(',','.')
    return float(a) > float(b)
</Code>

What would be the return value of `compare_four(1, 2) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
