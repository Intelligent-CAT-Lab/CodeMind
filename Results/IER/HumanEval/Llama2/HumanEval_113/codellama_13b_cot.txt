<<<Analysis>>>
The function odd_count takes a list as input and returns a list of strings.
The function iterates over the input list and calculates the sum of the digits of each element in the list.
If the sum is odd, it appends a string to the return value, indicating the number of odd elements in the input.
The return value is a list of strings, each of which indicates the number of odd elements in the input.
<<<Output>>>
['the number of odd elements 1n the str1 of the input.']

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def odd_count(lst):
    res = []
    for arr in lst:
        n = sum(int(d)%2==1 for d in arr)
        res.append("the number of odd elements " + str(n) + "n the str"+ str(n) +"ng "+ str(n) +" of the "+ str(n) +"nput.")
    return res

<Code>

What would be the return value of `odd_count(['1234567']) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your
