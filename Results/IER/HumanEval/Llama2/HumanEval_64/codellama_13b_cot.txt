<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to "racecar".
The code then converts s to lowercase.
It then calculates the length of s, which is 7.
It then sets i to 0 and j to 6.
It then starts a while loop that iterates from i to j.
For each iteration, it checks if the character at index i is equal to the character at index j.
If they are not equal, it returns False and exits the loop.
If they are equal, it increments i and decrements j.
After the loop finishes, it returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower()
    n = len(s)
    i = 0
    j = n - 1
    while i < j:
        if s[i] != s[j]:
            return False
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    return True
</Code>

What would be the return value of `is_palindrome("racecar")
