<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 14.
The code checks if n is even or odd. If n is even, it sets the list odd_collatz to an empty list. If n is odd, it sets the list odd_collatz to [n].
The code enters a while loop that iterates while n > 1.
The code checks if n is even. If it is, it divides n by 2. If n is odd, it multiplies n by 3 and adds 1.
It then checks if n is odd. If it is, it appends n to the list odd_collatz.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the sorted list odd_collatz.
<<<Output>>>
[2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 14]
