The variable l is initialized to [1, 3, 5, 0].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list l.
For each index i, it enters another loop that iterates from i + 1 to the length of the list.
Then it enters another loop that iterates from j + 1 to the length of the list.
The code checks if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] is equal to 0. If it is, the code returns True.
The condition is met when i = 0, j = 1 and k = 2, or i = 1, j = 2 and k = 3.

After the loop finishes, the code returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
