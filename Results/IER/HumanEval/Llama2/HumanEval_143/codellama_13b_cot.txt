The variable arr is initialized to [1,2,3,4,5].
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
In each iteration, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to i (inclusive).
In this loop, it checks if the value of arr[i] is greater than the value of arr[j]. If it is, the code adds 1 to the value of max_seq[i].
The final value of max_seq is returned.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_max_subsequence(arr, n):
    max_seq = [0]
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(1,n):
        for j in range(0,i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                max_seq[i] = max_seq[j] + 1
    return max_seq

<Code>

What would be the return value of `find_max_subsequence([1,2,3,4,5], 5)`?
