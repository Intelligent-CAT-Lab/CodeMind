<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized to 3 and the variable arr is initialized to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The code iterates through the elements of arr, starting with the first element.
For each element, it checks if it is equal to num. If it is, it returns the index of the element.
The code returns the index of the first element, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_index(num, arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == num:
            return i
</Code>

What would be the return value of `get_index(3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output
