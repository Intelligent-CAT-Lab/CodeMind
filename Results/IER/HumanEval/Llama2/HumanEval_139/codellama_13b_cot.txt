<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable fact_i is initialized to 1 and the variable special_fact is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies fact_i by i to calculate the factorial of i.
It then multiplies special_fact by the factorial of i to calculate the special factorial of i.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the special factorial of 4, which is 24.
<<<Output>>>
24
