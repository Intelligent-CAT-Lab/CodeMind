Consider the following code:

<Code>
def check_valid(num):
    if num == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
</Code>

What would be the return value of `check_valid(10)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
