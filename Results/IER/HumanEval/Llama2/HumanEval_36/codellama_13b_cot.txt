<<<Analysis>>>
The input is n = 50.
The code iterates from 0 to 50 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 50.
For each number i, it checks if i is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it appends it to the list ns.
The code then joins the elements of the list ns using the string concatenation operator.
The string is then converted to a list of characters. For each character in the list, the code checks if it is 7. If it is, the return value is incremented by 1.
The code returns the final value of ans, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
