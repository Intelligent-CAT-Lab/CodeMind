The code first checks if N is 1. If it is, it returns [A], which is the empty list in this case.
Otherwise, it creates a list called comb and iterates through M.
For each value i, it appends the list get_all_combinations(N-1, M, A+[i]) to comb.
In this case, N is 3, M is 2 and A is the empty list.
Therefore, the return value is:
```
[
    [0, 0],
    [0, 1],
    [1, 0],
    [1, 1]
]
```
<<<Output>>>
[
    [0, 0],
    [0, 1],
    [1, 0],
    [1, 1]
]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_duplicate(arr):
    if(len(arr) == 0): return []
    if(len(arr) == 1): return [arr[0]]
    if(arr[0] == arr[1]): return [arr[0]]
    else: return find_duplicate(arr[1:]) + [arr[0]]
</Code>

What would be the return value of `find_duplicate([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your
