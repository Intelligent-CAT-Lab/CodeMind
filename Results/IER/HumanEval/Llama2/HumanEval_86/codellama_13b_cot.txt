The code first splits the input string into a list of substrings, and then sorts each substring in place.
Finally, it joins the substrings back into a single string and returns the result.

The input string is 'Hi', so the code will first split it into ['H', 'i'], and then sort each substring to get ['H', 'i'].
Finally, it joins the substrings back into a single string and returns the result.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def anti_shuffle(s):
    return ' '.join([''.join(sorted(list(i))) for i in s.split(' ')])

<Code>

What would be the return value of `anti_shuffle('Hi') `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code
