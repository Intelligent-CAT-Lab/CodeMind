The code iterates over the values in the dictionary graph, which is a dictionary that maps node numbers to lists of neighboring node numbers.
The code starts with the node 0, which is the start node.
It then iterates over the neighbors of node 0 in the graph, which are 1 and 2.
It adds 1 and 2 to the queue, which is a list of nodes that the code will visit next.
It then iterates over the neighbors of 1 and 2 in the graph, which are 0 and 1, respectively.
It adds 0 and 1 to the queue.
It then iterates over the neighbors of 0 and 1 in the graph, which are 0 and 2, respectively.
It adds 0 and 2 to the queue.
It then iterates over the neighbors of 2 in the graph, which is an empty list, meaning there are no more neighbors of node 2.
It adds 2 to the visited list.
It then iterates over the neighbors of 0 and 1 in the graph, which are 0 and 1, respectively.
It adds 0 and 1 to the visited list.
It then iterates over the neighbors of 0 and 1 in the graph, which are 0 and 2, respectively.
It adds 0 and 2 to the visited list.
The code then returns the visited list, which is [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2].

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_all_paths(start_node, end_node, graph):
    paths = []
    visited = []
    queue = []
    queue.append(start_node)
    visited.append(start_node)
    while len(queue) != 0:
        node = queue.pop()
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.append(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    paths.append(visited)
    return paths
</Code>

What would be the return value of `get_all_paths(0, 3, {0: [1, 2], 1: [0], 2: [1], 3: []})`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
