<<<Analysis>>>
The input to the function is a list of 6 numbers and 2 ranges: [1.0, 3.0] and [1.0, 3.0].
The function first iterates through each number in the list, and checks if it is within the range of [1.0, 3.0].
If any number is not within the range, the function returns False.
Since all the numbers are within the range, the function returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def check_if_numbers_in_range(numbers: List[float], range_1: float, range_2: float) -> bool:
    for elem in numbers:
        if elem < range_1 or elem > range_2:
            return False

    return True

<Code>

What would be the return value of `check_if_numbers_in_range([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 1.0, 3.0) `?
