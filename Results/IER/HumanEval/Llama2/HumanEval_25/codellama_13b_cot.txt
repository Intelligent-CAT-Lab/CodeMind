The function `factorize(n: int)` takes an integer n as input and returns a list of factors of n.
The function first initializes an empty list fact.
Then it iterates from 2 to int(math.sqrt(n) + 1), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to the square root of n plus 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n % i == 0. If it is, it appends i to
