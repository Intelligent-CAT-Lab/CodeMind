The variable `numbers` is a list containing three numbers: 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0.
The code then calculates the mean of the list by summing up the elements and dividing the result by the length of the list.
The mean is then subtracted from each element of the list, and the absolute values of the differences are summed up.
The code then divides the sum by the length of the list to get the mean absolute deviation.

The return value of the code is 0.25.
<<<Output>>>
0.25

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    return sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)

<Code>

What would be the return value of `mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
