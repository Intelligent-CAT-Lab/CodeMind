<<<Analysis>>>
The variable strings and prefix are initialized to [], and 'john', respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates through the elements of strings, and checks if each element starts with prefix. If it does, it adds the element to a new list.
Since the strings list is empty, there is nothing to iterate through, and no elements will be added to the new list.

The code then returns the new list, which is empty.
