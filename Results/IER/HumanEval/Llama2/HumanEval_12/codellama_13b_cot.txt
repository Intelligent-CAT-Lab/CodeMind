<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 5 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if A is greater than B.
If it is, it returns A.
If it is not, it returns B.

In this case, A is 5 and B is 5.
The code checks if 5 is greater than 5, which is not true.
Therefore, it returns 5.
<<<Output>>>
