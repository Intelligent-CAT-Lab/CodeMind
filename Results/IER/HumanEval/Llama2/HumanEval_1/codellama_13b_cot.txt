The code starts with an empty list distinct_nums, which will be used to store the distinct numbers.

The code then iterates through the input list nums.
For each number n in the input, it will check if it is in the list distinct_nums.
If it is, it will not add it to the list.
If it is not, it will add it to the list.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the final list distinct_nums, which is
