The variable string is initialized to "[[".
The code then iterates through the string and keeps track of the opening and closing brackets.
The opening brackets are stored in the list opening_bracket_index, while the closing brackets are stored in the list closing_bracket_index.
The list closing_bracket_index is reversed, meaning the closing brackets will be stored in the list in descending order.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The variable l is initialized to the length of the list closing_bracket_index.
The code iterates through the opening brackets list opening_bracket_index.
For each opening bracket, it checks if there is a closing bracket that is smaller than the opening bracket in the list closing_bracket_index.
If there is, the variable cnt is incremented by 1.
The variable i is incremented by 1 if there is a closing bracket that is smaller than the opening bracket in the list closing_bracket_index.
The code iterates through the list closing_bracket_index and checks if there is a closing bracket that is smaller than the opening bracket in the list opening_bracket_index.
