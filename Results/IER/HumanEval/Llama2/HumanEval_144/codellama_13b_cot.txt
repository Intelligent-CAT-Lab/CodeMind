The code splits the input string "1/5" into "1" and "5". The code then splits the input string "5/1" into "5" and "1".
The code then calculates the product of the numerator and the denominator of "1/5" and "5/1", which are 5 and 5, respectively.
The code then calculates the quotient of the product of the numerator and the denominator of "1/5" and "5/1", which are 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then checks if the quotient is an integer,
