The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable A is initialized to an empty list.

The code iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of i*i - i + 1 and stores it in the list A.

The code iterates from i to n, meaning it will consider numbers from i to 5.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the sum of i*i - i + 1 and stores it in the list A.

The code iterates from j to n, meaning it will consider numbers from j to 5.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the sum of i*i - i + 1 and stores it in the list A.

The code checks if the sum of the three numbers is divisible by 3. If it is, it adds the triplet to the list ans.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ans, which is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_max_triples(n):
    A = [i*i - i + 1 for i in range(1,n+1)]
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1,n):
            for k in range(j+1,n):
                if (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0:
                    ans += [(A[i],A[j],A[k])]
    return len(ans)
</Code>

What would be the return value of `get_max_triples(5) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
