The function `longest_increasing_subsequence` takes an array of integers as input and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.

The first step is to find the longest increasing subsequence in the array.
This can be done by finding the longest increasing subsequence in the array and then finding the length of the subsequence.

The second step is to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.
This can be done by finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array and then finding the length of the subsequence.

The third step is to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.
This can be done by finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array and then finding the length of the subsequence.

The fourth step is to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.
This can be done by finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array and then finding the length of the subsequence.

The fifth step is to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.
This can be done by finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array and then finding the length of the subsequence.

The sixth step is to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.
This can be done by finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array and then finding the length of the subsequence.

The seventh step is to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.
This can be done by finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array and then finding the length of the subsequence.

The eighth step is to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.
This can be done by finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array and then finding the length of the subsequence.

The ninth step is to find the
