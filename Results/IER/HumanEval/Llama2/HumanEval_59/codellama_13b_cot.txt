The variable n is initialized to 15.
The function is_prime is called to check if n is a prime number.
The variable largest is initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 2 to n (inclusive).
The variable j is initialized to 2.
The variable k is initialized to 2.
The variable k is set to n.
The condition is checked if n is divisible by j and j is a prime number.
If it is, the variable largest is set to the maximum of largest and j.
The loop continues until the condition is not met.

After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of largest, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
