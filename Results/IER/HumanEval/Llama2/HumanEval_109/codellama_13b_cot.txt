<<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized to "Hello".
The code checks if the length of the string is 0, which it is not.
The code then iterates through the string from index 1 to the end (exclusive), which is "ello".
It then iterates through the string from index 0 to the end (exclusive), which is "Hello".
It then concatenates the two strings to get "HellO".
<<<Output>>>
"HellO"

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def reverse_a_string(str):
    if len(str)==0:
      return str
    else:
      return reverse_a_string(str[1:])+str[0]
