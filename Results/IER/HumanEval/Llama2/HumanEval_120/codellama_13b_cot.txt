<<<Analysis>>>
The input of the code is an array `arr` and an integer `k`.
The function `maximum` returns the `k` elements in the array that have the largest values.

The first line of code checks if `k` is 0. If it is, it returns an empty list.

The second line of code sorts the array.

The third line of code returns the last `k` elements in the array.

The return value of the function is the list [-3, -4, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[-3, -4, 5]
