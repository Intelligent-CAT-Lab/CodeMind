The variable a is initialized to 5, and the variable b is initialized to 2.
The code checks if a is 0. If it is, it returns 1.
If a is not 0, the code returns a * f(a - 1, b).
Since a is not 0, the code returns 5 * f(4, 2).
Since 4 is not 0, the code returns 5 * f(3, 2).
Since 3 is not 0, the code returns 5 * f(2, 2).
Since 2 is not 0, the code returns 5 * f(1, 2).
Since 1 is not 0, the code returns 5 * f(0, 2).
Since 0 is 0, the code returns 5 * 1.
Since 5 is not 0, the code returns 5 * 1.
Since 5 is not 0, the code returns 5 * 1.
