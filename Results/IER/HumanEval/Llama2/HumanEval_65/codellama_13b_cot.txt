<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 100 and variable shift is initialized to 2.
The code checks if shift is larger than the length of x, which is 2 in this case. If it is, it returns x reversed, which is 01.
If it is not, it returns the last two characters of x and the first two characters of x, which is 01.
