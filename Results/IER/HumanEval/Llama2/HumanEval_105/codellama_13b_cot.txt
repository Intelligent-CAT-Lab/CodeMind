The variable arr is initialized to [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3].
The variable dic is initialized to a dictionary with the key-value pairs (1, "One"), (2, "Two"), (3, "Three"), (4, "Four"), (5, "Five"), (6, "Six"), (7, "Seven"), (8, "Eight"), (9, "Nine").
The variable sorted_arr is initialized to a list sorted in reverse order, which is [8, 5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2].
The variable new_arr is initialized to an empty list.
The code then iterates through the elements of sorted_arr and tries to find the corresponding key in dic. If the key is found, it will be appended to new_arr. Otherwise, it will be ignored.
The return value of by_length is new_arr, which is ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Two", "Three", "One", "One", "Two"].
<<<Output>>>
["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Two", "Three", "One", "One", "Two"]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def by_length(arr):
    dic = {
        1: "One",
        2: "Two",
        3: "Three",
        4: "Four",
        5: "Five",
        6: "Six",
        7: "Seven",
        8: "Eight",
        9: "Nine",
    }
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
