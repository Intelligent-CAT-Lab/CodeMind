The variable lst is initialized to [1,2,3], and the variable result is initialized to an empty list.
The code then iterates through the list and calculates the squares of the elements that are divisible by 3.
It then iterates through the list again and calculates the cubes of the elements that are divisible by 4 but not 3.
Finally, it calculates the sum of all the elements in the list.
The return value of the code is 45.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_squares(lst):
    result =[]
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i %3 == 0:
            result.append(lst[i]**2)
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i%3 != 0:
            result.append(lst[i]**3)
        else:
            result.append(lst[i])
    return sum(result)

<Code>

What would be the return value of `sum_squares([1,2,3]) `?
