The variable numbers is a list of integers, which is [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5].
The code imports the collections module and declares a variable c that is initialized to a Counter object.
The Counter object is used to count the number of occurrences of each number in the list.
The code then iterates over the list numbers and returns a new list that contains only numbers that appear once in the original list.
The return value of the code is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

[INST]
Given the following code:
<Code>
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    import collections
    c = collections.Counter(numbers)
    return [n for n in numbers if c[n] <= 1]

<Code>

What would be the return value of `remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
