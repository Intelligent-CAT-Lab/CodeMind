<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list as input and returns the maximum value of the list.
The function starts by initializing maximum to the first element of the list.
It then iterates through the rest of the list, comparing each element to maximum.
If the element is larger than maximum, it replaces maximum with the element.
In this case, the function returns 5 because it is the largest value in the list.
<<<Output>>>
5
