The code first sets the variable max_product to the first element of the array arr, which is 2.
Then it iterates over the array, comparing the current element with max_product.
If the current element multiplied by the previous element is larger than max_product, it assigns max_product to the product of the current element and the previous element and continues the iteration.
The iteration finishes when the product of the current element and the previous element is smaller than max_
