<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to "Example".
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the string, character by character.
For each character, it checks if it is the last character in the string.
If it is, it appends the character to the new string.
It then increments the variable i.
The code then checks if i is greater than j.
If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
The code then returns the final value of the string, which is "Example".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def reverse(text):
    new_text = ""
    i = 0
    j = len(text)-1
    while i < j:
        new_text += text[i]
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    return new_text
</Code>

What would be the return value of `reverse("Example")`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on
