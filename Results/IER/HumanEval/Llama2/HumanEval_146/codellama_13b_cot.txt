<<<Analysis>>>
The variable nums is initialized to [5, -2, 1, -5].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each number in nums.
For each number num, it checks if it is greater than 10. If it is, it will check if the first and last digits of the number are odd.
The code iterates through the list odd_digits and checks if the first and last digits of num are in the list. If they are, the count is incremented.
The code returns the final value of count, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def specialFilter(nums):
    
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5
