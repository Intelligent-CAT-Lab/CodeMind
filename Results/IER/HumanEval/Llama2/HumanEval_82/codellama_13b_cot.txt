The variable string is initialized to 'Hello'.
The variable l is initialized to the length of string, which is 5.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to l (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it checks if l % i == 0, which is equivalent to checking if l is divisible by i. If it is, it returns False and exits the loop.
Since l is not divisible by 2, 3 or 4, the loop finishes and the code returns True.

True

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def prime_length(string):
    l = len(string)
    if l == 0 or l == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, l):
        if l % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

<Code>

What would be the return value of `prime_length('Hello') `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.
