<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 3, 4 and 5, respectively.
The code then checks the condition of the three sides of the triangle. If the condition is not met, it returns -1.
If the condition is met, it calculates the area of the triangle by multiplying the sides of the triangle. The area is then rounded to 2 decimal places.
The code then returns the rounded area, which is 6.25.
<<<Output>>>
6.25

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2    
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
    area = round(area, 2)
    return area

<Code>

What would be the return value of `triangle_area(3, 4, 5) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value
