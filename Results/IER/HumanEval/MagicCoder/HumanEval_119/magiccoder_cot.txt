I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Output>>>

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:

def match_parens(lst):
    def check(s):
        val = 0
        for i in s:
            if i == '(':
                val = val + 1
            else:
                val = val - 1
            if val < 0:
                return False
        return True if val == 0 else False

    S1 = lst[0] + lst[1]
    S2 = lst[1] + lst[0]
    return 'Yes' if check(S1) or check(S2) else 'No'

<<<Analysis>>>
The function match_parens takes a list of two strings as input. The first string is S1 and the second string is S2.

The function check is a nested function that takes a string as input and checks if the parentheses in the string are balanced. It does this by iterating through the string and incrementing a counter for each '(' and decrementing it for each ')'. If at any point the counter goes below 0, the function returns False. If the counter is 0 at the end of the string, the function returns True. If the counter is not 0 at the end of the string, the function returns False.

The function match_parens then concatenates the two strings and checks if the parentheses in the concatenated string are balanced. If they are, it returns 'Yes'. If they are not, it returns 'No'.

For the input ['()(', ')'], the function concatenates the strings to get '()()' and checks if the parentheses are balanced. Since the parentheses are balanced, the function returns 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
'Yes'
