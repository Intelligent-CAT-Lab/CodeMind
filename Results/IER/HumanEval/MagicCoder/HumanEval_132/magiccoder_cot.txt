I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_nested(string):
    opening_bracket_index = []
    closing_bracket_index = []
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] == '[':
            opening_bracket_index.append(i)
        else:
            closing_bracket_index.append(i)
    closing_bracket_index.reverse()
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    l = len(closing_bracket_index)
    for idx in opening_bracket_index:
        if i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]:
            cnt += 1
            i += 1
    return cnt >= 2

<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_nested takes a string as input. It initializes two empty lists, opening_bracket_index and closing_bracket_index, to store the indices of opening and closing brackets respectively.

The function then iterates over the string, and for each character, if it is an opening bracket, it appends its index to opening_bracket_index. If it is a closing bracket, it appends its index to closing_bracket_index.

The closing_bracket_index list is then reversed to make it in ascending order of indices.

The function then initializes a counter cnt to 0 and an index i to 0.

The function then iterates over the opening_bracket_index list, and for each index, if it is less than the current index in closing_bracket_index, it increments the counter and moves to the next index in closing_bracket_index.

Finally, the function returns True if the counter is greater than or equal to 2, and False otherwise.

<<<Output>>>
True
