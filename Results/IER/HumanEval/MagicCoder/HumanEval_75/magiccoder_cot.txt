I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    def is_prime(n):
        for j in range(2,n):
            if n%j == 0:
                return False
        return True

    for i in range(2,101):
        if not is_prime(i): continue
        for j in range(2,101):
            if not is_prime(j): continue
            for k in range(2,101):
                if not is_prime(k): continue
                if i*j*k == a: return True
    return False

<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_multiply_prime(a) checks if there are three prime numbers i, j, k such that i*j*k equals a.
The function is_prime(n) checks if a number n is prime.
The function is_multiply_prime(a) iterates over all possible combinations of three prime numbers i, j, k from 2 to 100.
If it finds a combination that satisfies the condition i*j*k == a, it returns True.
If it doesn't find any such combination, it returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
