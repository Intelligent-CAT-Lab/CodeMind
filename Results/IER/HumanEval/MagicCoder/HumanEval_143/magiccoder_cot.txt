You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

@@ Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    new_lst = []
    for word in sentence.split():
        flg = 0
        if len(word) == 1:
            flg = 1
        for i in range(2, len(word)):
            if len(word)%i == 0:
                flg = 1
        if flg == 0 or len(word) == 2:
            new_lst.append(word)
    return " ".join(new_lst)

<<<Analysis>>>
The function words_in_sentence takes a sentence as input. The sentence is split into words using the split() function.
For each word in the sentence, the function checks if the length of the word is 1 or 2. If it is, the function appends the word to the new_lst list.
If the length of the word is greater than 2, the function checks if the length of the word is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. If it is, the function appends the word to the new_lst list.
Finally, the function returns the words in the new_lst list joined by a space.
<<<Output>>>
"This is a test"
