I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

def sum_squares(lst):
    result =[]
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i %3 == 0:
            result.append(lst[i]**2)
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i%3 != 0:
            result.append(lst[i]**3)
        else:
            result.append(lst[i])
    return sum(result)

<<<Analysis>>>
The function sum_squares takes a list of integers as input.
The function iterates over the list, and for each index i, it checks if i is divisible by 3 or 4.
If i is divisible by 3, it appends the square of the element at index i to the result list.
If i is divisible by 4 but not by 3, it appends the cube of the element at index i to the result list.
If i is not divisible by either 3 or 4, it appends the element at index i to the result list.
Finally, it returns the sum of all elements in the result list.

For the input list [1,2,3], the function will do the following:
- For index 0, 3 is not divisible by 3 or 4, so it appends 1 to the result list.
- For index 1, 2 is not divisible by 3 or 4, so it appends 2 to the result list.
- For index 2, 3 is divisible by 3, so it appends 9 (the cube of 3) to the result list.

The function then returns the sum of all elements in the result list, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
