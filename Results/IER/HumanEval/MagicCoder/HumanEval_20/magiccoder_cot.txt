You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    closest_pair = None
    distance = None

    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                if distance is None:
                    distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                    closest_pair = tuple(sorted([elem, elem2]))
                else:
                    new_distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                    if new_distance < distance:
                        distance = new_distance
                        closest_pair = tuple(sorted([elem, elem2]))

    return closest_pair

[Question]
What would be the return value of`find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) `?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function find_closest_elements takes a list of numbers as input. It initializes closest_pair and distance to None.
The function then enters a nested loop that iterates over each pair of numbers in the list. If the pair is not the same number (i.e., idx!= idx2), it calculates the absolute difference between the two numbers and checks if it's less than the current distance. If it is, it updates the closest_pair and distance.
After the loops finish, the function returns the closest_pair.
<<<Output>>>
(2.0, 2.2)
