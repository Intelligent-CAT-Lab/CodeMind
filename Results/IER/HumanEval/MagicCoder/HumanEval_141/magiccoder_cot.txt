@@ Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def file_name_check(file_name):
    suf = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    lst = file_name.split(sep='.')
    if len(lst) != 2:
        return 'No'
    if not lst[1] in suf:
        return 'No'
    if len(lst[0]) == 0:
        return 'No'
    if not lst[0][0].isalpha():
        return 'No'
    t = len([x for x in lst[0] if x.isdigit()])
    if t > 3:
        return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

The function file_name_check takes a file name as input. It first checks if the file name has a valid extension. If it does not, it returns 'No'. Then it checks if the file name has a valid name. If it does not, it returns 'No'. If the file name is valid, it returns 'Yes'.

The file name is split into two parts at the period. If the split does not result in exactly two parts, the file name is not valid, so 'No' is returned.

The second part of the split (the extension) is checked. If it is not in the list of valid extensions, 'No' is returned.

The first part of the split (the name) is checked. If it is empty, 'No' is returned.

The first character of the name is checked. If it is not a letter, 'No' is returned.

The name is then checked for digits. If there are more than three digits, 'No' is returned.

If all checks pass, 'Yes' is returned, indicating that the file name is valid.

<<<Output>>>
'Yes'
