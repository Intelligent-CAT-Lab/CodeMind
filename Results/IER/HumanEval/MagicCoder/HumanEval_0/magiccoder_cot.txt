I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True

    return False

What would be the return value of`has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3) `?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function has_close_elements takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold.

The function iterates over each pair of numbers in the list. For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference between the two numbers. If the difference is less than the threshold, the function returns True. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, the function returns False.

In the given example, the list is [1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2] and the threshold is 0.3. The function checks the pairs (1.0, 2.0), (1.0, 3.9), (1.0, 4.0), (1.0, 5.0), (1.0, 2.2), (2.0, 3.9), (2.0, 4.0), (2.0, 5.0), (2.0, 2.2), (3.9, 4.0), (3.9, 5.0), (3.9, 2.2), (4.0, 5.0), (4.0, 2.2), (5.0, 2.2). For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference. For example, for the pair (1.0, 2.0), the difference is 1.0. Since 1.0 is less than 0.3, the function returns True.

True
