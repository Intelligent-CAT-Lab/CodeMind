I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

Consider the following code:

def get_max_triples(n):
    A = [i*i - i + 1 for i in range(1,n+1)]
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1,n):
            for k in range(j+1,n):
                if (A[i]+A[j]+A[k])%3 == 0:
                    ans += [(A[i],A[j],A[k])]
    return len(ans)

<<<Analysis>>>
The function get_max_triples(n) takes an integer n as input.
The list A is created by generating the sequence of numbers (i*i - i + 1) for i from 1 to n.
The list ans is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters three nested loops. The outer loop iterates over the indices i from 0 to n-1, the middle loop iterates over the indices j from i+1 to n-1, and the inner loop iterates over the indices k from j+1 to n-1.
For each triple (A[i], A[j], A[k]), the code checks if the sum of the triple is divisible by 3. If it is, the triple is added to the list ans.
Finally, the function returns the length of the list ans, which is the number of triples that meet the condition.
