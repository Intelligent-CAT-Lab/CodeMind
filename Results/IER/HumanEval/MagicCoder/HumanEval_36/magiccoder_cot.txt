I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            ns.append(i)
    s = ''.join(list(map(str, ns)))
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        ans += (c == '7')
    return ans

[Question]
What would be the return value of`fizz_buzz(50) `?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function fizz_buzz takes an integer n as input. It initializes an empty list ns and then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1. For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it appends i to ns. After the loop finishes, it joins all the elements in ns into a string s. Then it initializes an integer ans to 0 and enters another loop that iterates over each character c in s. If c is '7', it increments ans by 1. After the loop finishes, it returns ans.

The function fizz_buzz(50) will return the number of times the digit '7' appears in the numbers from 0 to 49 that are divisible by 11 or 13.
