You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    ret = set()
    for e1 in l1:
        for e2 in l2:
            if e1 == e2:
                ret.add(e1)
    return sorted(list(ret))

[Question]
What would be the return value of`common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]) `?

<<<Analysis>>>
The function common takes two lists as input. It initializes an empty set ret. Then it iterates over each element e1 in the first list and each element e2 in the second list. If e1 equals e2, it adds e1 to the set ret. Finally, it returns the sorted list of elements in ret.

The input lists are [1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5] and [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121].

The common elements in these two lists are 1, 5, and 653.

So, the output of the function common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]) would be [1, 5, 653].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 653]
