I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    def xor(i, j):
        if i == j:
            return '0'
        else:
            return '1'

    return ''.join(xor(x, y) for x, y in zip(a, b))

<<<Analysis>>>
The function string_xor takes two binary strings as input. It then applies the XOR operation on each pair of corresponding bits in the two strings. The XOR operation returns '1' if the bits are different, and '0' if they are the same.

The function xor is a helper function that performs the XOR operation on two bits.

The function string_xor uses the zip function to iterate over the two input strings in parallel. For each pair of bits, it applies the xor function to get the result. The results are then joined into a single string using the join method.

The XOR operation is applied to the binary strings '111000' and '101010'. The XOR operation is performed on the corresponding bits of the two strings. The result is a new binary string.

The XOR operation on '111000' and '101010' is '010010', which is the output of the function string_xor.
<<<Output>>>
'010010'
