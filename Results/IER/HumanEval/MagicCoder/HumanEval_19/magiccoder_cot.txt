I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1

[Question]
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    value_map = {
        'zero': 0,

        'two': 2,
        'three': 3,
        'four': 4,
        'five': 5,
        'six': 6,
        'seven': 7,
        'eight': 8,
        'nine': 9
    }
    return ' '.join(sorted([x for x in numbers.split(' ') if x], key=lambda x: value_map[x]))

<<<Analysis>>>
The function sort_numbers takes a string of space-separated words as input. It first maps each word to its corresponding number using the value_map dictionary. Then it sorts the words based on their corresponding numbers and returns the sorted list as a string.

The input string 'five zero four seven nine eight' is split into a list of words ['five', 'zero', 'four','seven', 'nine', 'eight']. The words are then sorted based on their corresponding numbers. The sorted list is then joined back into a string with spaces between each word.

The sorted list of words is ['zero', 'four', 'five', 'eight', 'nine','seven'], which corresponds to the numbers [0, 4, 5, 8, 9, 7] respectively.

The sorted list is then joined back into a string with spaces between each word, resulting in the output string 'zero four five eight nine seven'.
<<<Output>>>
'zero four five eight nine seven'
