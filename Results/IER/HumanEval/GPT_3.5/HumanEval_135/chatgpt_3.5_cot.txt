<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `can_arrange` that takes a list `arr` as input.
It initializes a variable `ind` to -1, which will be used to store the index of the element in `arr` that violates the ascending order.
It also initializes a variable `i` to 1, which will be used as a loop counter.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`.
If this condition is true, it updates the value of `ind` to the current value of `i`.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of `ind`.
In this case, the input list is [1,2,4,3,5].
The code compares each element with its previous element and finds that the element at index 3 (value 3) violates the ascending order.
Therefore, the code will return the value 3.
