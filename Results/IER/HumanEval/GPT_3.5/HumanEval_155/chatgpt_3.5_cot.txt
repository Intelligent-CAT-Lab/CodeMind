<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized to 7.
The variables even_count and odd_count are initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of even and odd digits in the number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each digit in the absolute value of num (in this case, only one digit, 7).
For each digit i, it checks if it is even by taking the modulus of i divided by 2. If the result is 0, it means the digit is even and it increments even_count by 1. Otherwise, it increments odd_count by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns a tuple containing the values of even_count and odd_count, which in this case is (0, 1).
<<<Output>>>
(0, 1)
