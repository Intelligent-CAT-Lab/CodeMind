<<<Analysis>>>
The function `compare` takes two lists as input: `game` and `guess`.
It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `game` and `guess` simultaneously.
For each pair of elements (x, y) in the zip of `game` and `guess`, it calculates the absolute difference between them using the `abs` function.
The result is a list of absolute differences between corresponding elements of `game` and `guess`.
In this case, the input lists are [1,2,3,4,5,1] and [1,2,3,4,2,-2].
The absolute differences between corresponding elements are [0,0,0,0,3,3].
Therefore, the return value of `compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])` is [0,0,0,0,3,3].
<<<Output>>>
[0,0,0,0,3,3]
