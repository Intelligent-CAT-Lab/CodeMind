<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is 'a b b a'.
The code first initializes an empty dictionary called dict1.
Then, it splits the input string into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter. So, the list1 becomes ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a'].
The variable t is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each word in the list1.
Inside the loop, it checks if the count of the current word in the list1 is greater than the current value of t and if the current word is not an empty string.
If both conditions are true, it updates the value of t to the count of the current word.
After the loop finishes, it checks if t is greater than 0.
If t is greater than 0, it enters another loop that iterates over each word in the list1.
Inside this loop, it checks if the count of the current word in the list1 is equal to t.
If it is, it adds an entry to the dict1 dictionary with the current word as the key and t as the value.
Finally, it returns the dict1 dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{'b': 2, 'a': 2}
