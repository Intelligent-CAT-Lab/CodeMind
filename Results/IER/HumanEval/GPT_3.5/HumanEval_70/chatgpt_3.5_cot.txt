<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `strange_sort_list` that takes a list `lst` as input.
Inside the function, two empty lists `res` and `switch` are initialized.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until the list `lst` is empty.
In each iteration of the loop, the code appends either the minimum or maximum value from the list `lst` to the list `res`, depending on the value of the boolean variable `switch`.
After appending the value to `res`, the code removes it from `lst` using the `remove` method.
Finally, the code toggles the value of `switch` by using the `not` operator.
Once the loop finishes, the function returns the list `res`.
