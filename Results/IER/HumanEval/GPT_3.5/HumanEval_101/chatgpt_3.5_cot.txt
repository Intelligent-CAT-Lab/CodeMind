<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "Hi, my name is John".
The code first checks if the string is empty. If it is, it returns an empty list.
Since the string is not empty, it initializes an empty list called s_list.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is a comma. If it is, it appends a space to the s_list. Otherwise, it appends the character itself.
After the loop finishes, it joins all the characters in s_list into a single string using the "".join() method.
Finally, it splits the resulting string into a list of words using the split() method, which splits the string at whitespace characters.
The resulting list is returned as the output.
<<<Output>>>
['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']
