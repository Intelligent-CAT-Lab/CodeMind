<<<Analysis>>>
The function `modp` takes two arguments, `n` and `p`. It initializes a variable `ret` to 1.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates `n` times. In each iteration, it multiplies `ret` by 2 and takes the modulo `p` of the result. The updated value of `ret` is stored back in `ret`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `ret`.
In this case, `n` is 3 and `p` is 5. So, the loop will iterate 3 times.
1st iteration: `ret` = (2 * 1) % 5 = 2 % 5 = 2
2nd iteration: `ret` = (2 * 2) % 5 = 4 % 5 = 4
3rd iteration: `ret` = (2 * 4) % 5 = 8 % 5 = 3
The final value of `ret` is 3, which is the return value of the function.
