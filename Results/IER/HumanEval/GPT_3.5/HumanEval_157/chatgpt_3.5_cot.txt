<<<Analysis>>>
The function `right_angle_triangle` takes three arguments: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
The function checks if any of the three conditions `a*a == b*b + c*c`, `b*b == a*a + c*c`, or `c*c == a*a + b*b` is true.
In this case, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are 3, 4, and 5 respectively.
The function checks if `3*3 == 4*4 + 5*5`, which is true.
Therefore, the return value of `right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)` is `True`.
<<<Output>>>
True
