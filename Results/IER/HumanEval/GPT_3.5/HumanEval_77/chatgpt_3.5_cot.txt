<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called iscube that takes one parameter, a.
Inside the function, the absolute value of a is calculated using the abs() function.
Then, the cube root of the absolute value of a is calculated using the ** operator and the 1/3 power.
The result of the cube root is rounded to the nearest integer using the round() function.
Finally, the cube of the rounded cube root is compared to the original absolute value of a using the == operator.
If the two values are equal, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
In this case, the input value is 1.
The absolute value of 1 is 1.
The cube root of 1 is 1.
The rounded cube root of 1 is 1.
1 cubed is 1.
Therefore, the function will return True.
<<<Output>>>
True
