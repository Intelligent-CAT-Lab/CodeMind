<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 50.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 49.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it appends i to the list ns.
After the loop finishes, the code joins the elements of ns into a single string s.
Then, the code initializes a variable ans to 0 and enters another loop that iterates over each character c in s.
For each character c, it checks if c is equal to '7'. If it is, it increments ans by 1.
Finally, the code returns the value of ans, which represents the number of occurrences of the character '7' in the string s.
