<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `all_prefixes` that takes a string as input and returns a list of all the prefixes of that string.
Inside the function, an empty list called `result` is initialized.
Then, a loop is started that iterates over the indices of the string, from 0 to len(string)-1.
For each index i, the code appends the substring of the string from index 0 to i+1 (inclusive) to the `result` list.
Finally, the `result` list is returned.
In this case, the input string is 'asdfgh', so the prefixes would be ['a', 'as', 'asd', 'asdf', 'asdfg', 'asdfgh'].
<<<Output>>>
['a', 'as', 'asd', 'asdf', 'asdfg', 'asdfgh']
