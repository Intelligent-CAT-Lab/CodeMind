<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized to "AB".
The variable primes is a tuple containing the characters '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', and 'D'.
The variable total is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of characters in num that are present in the primes tuple.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of num - 1, which is 1 in this case.
For each character at index i in num, it checks if the character is present in the primes tuple. If it is, it increments the total by 1.
In this case, both 'A' and 'B' are present in the primes tuple, so the total is incremented by 2.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of total, which is 2.
