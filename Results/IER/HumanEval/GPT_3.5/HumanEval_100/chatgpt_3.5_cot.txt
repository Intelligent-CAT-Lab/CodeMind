<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code then creates a list comprehension that generates a list of numbers. Each number in the list is obtained by adding n to 2 times the index i.
In this case, the list comprehension generates the following list: [3, 5, 7].
Finally, the code returns the generated list.
<<<Output>>>
[3, 5, 7]
