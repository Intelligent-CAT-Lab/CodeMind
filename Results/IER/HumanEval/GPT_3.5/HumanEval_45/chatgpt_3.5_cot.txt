<<<Analysis>>>
The function `triangle_area` takes two parameters `a` and `h`.
It calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `a * h / 2.0`, where `a` is the length of the base and `h` is the height.
In this case, `a` is 5 and `h` is 3.
So, the area of the triangle would be `5 * 3 / 2.0`, which is 7.5.
<<<Output>>>
7.5
