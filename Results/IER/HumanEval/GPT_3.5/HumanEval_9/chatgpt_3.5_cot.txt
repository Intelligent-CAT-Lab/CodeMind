The code defines a function called `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers as output.
Inside the function, two variables are initialized: `running_max` is set to `None` and `result` is set to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element `n` in the input list `numbers`.
Inside the loop, the code checks if `running_max` is `None`. If it is, it means that this is the first element in the list, so `running_max` is set to the current element `n`.
If `running_max` is not `None`, it means that there is already a maximum value stored in `running_max`. In this case, the code compares `running_max` with the current element `n` using the `max()` function, and updates `running_max` to the larger of the two values.
After updating `running_max`, the code appends it to the `result` list.
Once the loop finishes, the code returns the `result` list, which contains the running maximum values for each element in the input list.
In this specific case, the input list is [3, 2, 3, 100, 3].
The running maximum values at each step are: [3, 3, 3, 100, 100].
Therefore, the return value of `rolling_max([3, 2, 3, 100, 3])` is [3, 3, 3, 100, 100].
