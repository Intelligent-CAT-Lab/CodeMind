<<<Analysis>>>
The function `find_closest_elements` takes a list of floats as input and returns a tuple containing the two elements that have the smallest absolute difference.

The function initializes two variables, `closest_pair` and `distance`, to None. These variables will be used to keep track of the closest pair of elements and their distance.

The function then enters a nested loop that iterates over each element in the input list. For each pair of elements, it calculates the absolute difference between them using the `abs` function.

If `distance` is None (i.e., this is the first pair of elements being considered), the function updates `distance` to the absolute difference and `closest_pair` to the tuple of the two elements.

If `distance` is not None, the function calculates the absolute difference between the current pair of elements and compares it to the current `distance`. If the new difference is smaller, the function updates `distance` and `closest_pair` accordingly.

After the nested loop finishes, the function returns the `closest_pair`.

In this case, the input list is [1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]. The function will compare each pair of elements and update `closest_pair` and `distance` if a closer pair is found.

The closest pair of elements is (2.0, 2.2) with a distance of 0.2.

<<<Output>>>
(2.0, 2.2)
