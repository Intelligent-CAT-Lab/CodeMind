<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `string` is an empty string and the variable `substring` is 'x'.
The variable `times` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the `substring` appears in the `string`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of `string` minus the length of `substring` plus 1. This loop will not be executed since the length of `string` is 0 and the length of `substring` is 1.
The code then returns the value of `times`, which is 0.
