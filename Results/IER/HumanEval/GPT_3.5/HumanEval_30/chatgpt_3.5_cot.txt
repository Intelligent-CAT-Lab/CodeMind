<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `get_positive` that takes a list `l` as input.
Inside the function, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the elements from `l` that are greater than 0.
The code then returns this new list.
In this case, the input list is [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6].
The code filters out the negative numbers and returns the list [4, 5, 6].
<<<Output>>>
[4, 5, 6]
