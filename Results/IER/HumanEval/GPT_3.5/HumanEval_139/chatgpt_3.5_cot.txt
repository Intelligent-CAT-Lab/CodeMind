<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variables fact_i and special_fact are initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies fact_i by i and stores the result back in fact_i.
It also multiplies special_fact by fact_i and stores the result back in special_fact.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of special_fact, which is 288.
<<<Output>>>
288
