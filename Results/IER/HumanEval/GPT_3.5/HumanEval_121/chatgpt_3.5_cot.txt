<<<Analysis>>>
The function `solution` takes a list `lst` as input.
It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `lst` along with their indices.
For each element `x` at index `idx`, it checks if `idx` is even (i.e., divisible by 2) and if `x` is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2).
If both conditions are true, it adds `x` to a new list.
Finally, it returns the sum of all the elements in the new list.
In this case, the input list is [5, 8, 7, 1].
The function will consider the elements at indices 0 and 2, which are 5 and 7 respectively.
The sum of these two elements is 12, so the expected output is 12.
