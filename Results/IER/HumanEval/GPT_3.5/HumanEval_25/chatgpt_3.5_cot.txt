<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors.
The code initializes an empty list called `fact` to store the prime factors.
It also initializes a variable `i` to 2, which will be used to iterate through potential factors of `n`.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` plus 1.
Inside the loop, the code checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator. If it is, it means `i` is a prime factor of `n`.
In that case, the code appends `i` to the `fact` list and updates `n` by dividing it by `i`.
If `n` is not divisible by `i`, the code increments `i` by 1 and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if `n` is greater than 1. If it is, it means `n` itself is a prime factor and it appends it to the `fact` list.
Finally, the code returns the `fact` list.
