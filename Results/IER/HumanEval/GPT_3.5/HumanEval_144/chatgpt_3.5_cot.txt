<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, x and n, which are strings representing fractions in the form "a/b".
It then splits the strings at the "/" character to separate the numerator and denominator of each fraction.
The code converts the numerator and denominator of both fractions to integers.
It multiplies the numerators and denominators together to get the numerator and denominator of the product fraction.
The code then checks if the division of the numerator by the denominator is an integer. If it is, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
In this case, the numerator of the first fraction is 1 and the denominator is 5. The numerator of the second fraction is 5 and the denominator is 1.
Multiplying these together gives a numerator of 5 and a denominator of 5.
The division of the numerator by the denominator is 1, which is an integer, so the code returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
