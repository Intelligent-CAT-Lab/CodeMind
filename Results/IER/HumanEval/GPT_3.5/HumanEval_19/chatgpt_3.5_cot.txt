<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_numbers` takes a string `numbers` as input.
Inside the function, a dictionary `value_map` is defined, which maps the string representation of numbers to their corresponding integer values.
The function then splits the input string `numbers` into a list of individual words using the space character as the delimiter.
Next, a list comprehension is used to filter out any empty strings from the list of words.
For each non-empty word in the filtered list, the corresponding integer value is retrieved from the `value_map` dictionary.
The filtered list of integer values is then sorted in ascending order using the `sorted` function, with the `key` parameter set to a lambda function that retrieves the integer value for each word.
Finally, the sorted list of integer values is converted back to a string using the `join` method, with each value separated by a space.
The resulting string is returned as the output of the function.

'zero four five seven eight nine'
