<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `sum_product` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of the numbers in the list.

Inside the function, two variables `sum_value` and `prod_value` are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively. These variables will be used to accumulate the sum and product of the numbers.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each number `n` in the input list. For each number, it adds `n` to `sum_value` and multiplies `n` with `prod_value`.

After the loop finishes, the code returns a tuple containing the final values of `sum_value` and `prod_value`.

In this case, the input list is [1, 1, 1]. The code will iterate over each number and add it to `sum_value` and multiply it with `prod_value`. Since all the numbers are 1, the sum and product will also be 1.

<<<Output>>>
(3, 1)
