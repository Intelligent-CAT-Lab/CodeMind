<<<Analysis>>>
The function `encode` takes a string `message` as input.
It initializes a string `vowels` with all the vowels in lowercase and uppercase.
It creates a dictionary `vowels_replace` where each vowel is mapped to the character obtained by adding 2 to its ASCII value.
It then swaps the case of the characters in the `message` string using the `swapcase()` method.
Finally, it creates a new string by iterating over each character in the `message` string. If the character is a vowel, it replaces it with the corresponding value from the `vowels_replace` dictionary. Otherwise, it keeps the character as it is.
The function returns the resulting string.

In this case, the input is 'TEST'.
The function swaps the case of the characters in the string, resulting in 'test'.
Then, it replaces each vowel in the string with the corresponding value from the `vowels_replace` dictionary.
The resulting string is 'tgst'.
Therefore, the return value of `encode('TEST')` is 'tgst'.
