<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function named unique that takes a list l as input.
Inside the function, it first converts the list l into a set using the set() function. This removes any duplicate elements from the list.
Then, it converts the set back into a list using the list() function.
Finally, it sorts the list in ascending order using the sorted() function.
The sorted and unique list is then returned as the output of the function.
In this case, the input list is [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123].
After removing duplicates, the set becomes {0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}.
After converting the set back into a list and sorting it, the final output is [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
