<<<Analysis>>>
The function `common` takes two lists, `l1` and `l2`, as input.
It initializes an empty set called `ret` to store the common elements between the two lists.
The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates over each element `e1` in `l1`, and the inner loop iterates over each element `e2` in `l2`.
For each pair of elements, the code checks if they are equal. If they are, it adds the element to the set `ret`.
After both loops finish, the code converts the set `ret` to a list, sorts it in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.
In this case, the common elements between the two lists are 1, 5, and 653. After sorting them, the function will return [1, 5, 653].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 653]
