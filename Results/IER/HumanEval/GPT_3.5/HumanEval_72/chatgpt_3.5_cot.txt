<<<Analysis>>>
The function `will_it_fly` takes two arguments, `q` and `w`.
The code first checks if the sum of the elements in `q` is greater than `w`. If it is, the function returns `False`.
If the sum of the elements in `q` is not greater than `w`, the code enters a while loop.
The while loop iterates until `i` is less than `j`. `i` starts at 0 and `j` starts at the index of the last element in `q`.
In each iteration of the while loop, the code checks if the element at index `i` in `q` is equal to the element at index `j` in `q`. If they are not equal, the function returns `False`.
After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is decremented by 1.
If the while loop completes without returning `False`, it means that all the elements in `q` are equal when read from both ends. In this case, the function returns `True`.
In this case, the function is called with arguments `3, 4, 5`. The sum of the elements in `q` is 12, which is not greater than `w`. The while loop is not entered and the function returns `True`.
