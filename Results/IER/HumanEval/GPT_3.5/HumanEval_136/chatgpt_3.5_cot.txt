<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `largest_smallest_integers` that takes a list `lst` as input.
Inside the function, it creates two new lists: `smallest` and `largest`.
The `smallest` list is created by filtering the elements of `lst` using a lambda function that checks if the element is less than 0.
The `largest` list is created by filtering the elements of `lst` using a lambda function that checks if the element is greater than 0.
The function then returns a tuple containing the maximum value from the `smallest` list (if it is not empty) and the minimum value from the `largest` list (if it is not empty).
In this case, the input list is [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7].
The `smallest` list will be empty because there are no elements less than 0.
The `largest` list will contain all the elements from the input list because they are all greater than 0.
Therefore, the function will return (None, 1).
<<<Output>>>
(None, 1)
