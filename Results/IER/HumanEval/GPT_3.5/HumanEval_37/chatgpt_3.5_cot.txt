<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_even` takes a list `l` as input.
It first creates a new list `evens` by selecting every second element from `l` starting from index 0.
Then it creates a new list `odds` by selecting every second element from `l` starting from index 1.
Next, it sorts the `evens` list in ascending order.
Then it initializes an empty list `ans`.
It then iterates over the `evens` and `odds` lists simultaneously using the `zip` function.
For each pair of elements `(e, o)` from `evens` and `odds`, it extends the `ans` list with the elements `[e, o]`.
If the length of `evens` is greater than the length of `odds`, it appends the last element of `evens` to the `ans` list.
Finally, it returns the `ans` list.

In this case, the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
The `evens` list will be `[1, 3]` and the `odds` list will be `[2]`.
After sorting the `evens` list, it remains the same.
The `ans` list will be `[1, 2, 3]`.
Since the length of `evens` is not greater than the length of `odds`, there is no need to append any element.
Therefore, the return value of `tuple(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))` will be `(1, 2, 3)`.

<<<Output>>>
(1, 2, 3)
