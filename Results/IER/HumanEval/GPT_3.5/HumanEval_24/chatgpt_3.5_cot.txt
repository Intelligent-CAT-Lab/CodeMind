<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates in reverse order from n-1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers 2 and 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i (i.e., n % i == 0). If it is, it returns i as the largest divisor of n.
In this case, when i is 2, the condition is met and the code returns 2.
