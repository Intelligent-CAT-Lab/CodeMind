<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `is_multiply_prime` that takes an integer `a` as input.
Inside the function, there is another function `is_prime` that checks if a number is prime or not. It iterates from 2 to n-1 and checks if n is divisible by any number in this range. If it is divisible by any number, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to 100 (inclusive) and checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function. If a number is not prime, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Inside this loop, there is another loop that iterates from 2 to 100 (inclusive) and checks if each number is prime. If a number is not prime, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Inside this loop, there is yet another loop that iterates from 2 to 100 (inclusive) and checks if each number is prime. If a number is not prime, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Inside this loop, the code checks if the product of the three numbers (i, j, and k) is equal to the input number `a`. If it is, the function returns True.

If none of the combinations of i, j, and k result in the product equal to `a`, the function returns False.

In this case, the input number is 5. The code goes through all the combinations of i, j, and k from 2 to 100 and checks if their product is equal to 5. Since there is no combination that satisfies this condition, the function returns False.

<<<Output>>>
False
