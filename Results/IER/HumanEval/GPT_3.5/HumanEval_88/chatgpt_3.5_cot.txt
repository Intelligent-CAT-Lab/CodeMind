<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called sort_array that takes an array as input.
The code first checks if the length of the array is 0. If it is, it returns an empty array.
If the length of the array is not 0, the code proceeds to sort the array in ascending order.
The reverse parameter of the sorted function is set to True if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, and False otherwise.
In this case, the sum of the first and last elements of the array is 15 + 0 = 15, which is odd. Therefore, the reverse parameter is set to False.
The sorted function then returns the sorted array.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87]
