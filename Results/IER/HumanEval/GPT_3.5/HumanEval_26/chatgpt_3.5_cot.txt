<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the duplicates removed.
Inside the function, it imports the `collections` module and creates a counter object `c` using the `Counter` function from the `collections` module. The `Counter` function counts the occurrences of each element in the input list and stores them in a dictionary-like object.
The code then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `n` in the input list `numbers`. It checks if the count of `n` in the `c` counter object is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it includes `n` in the new list.
Finally, the function returns the new list with the duplicates removed.
In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]. The count of each element in the input list is:
- 1: 1 occurrence
- 2: 2 occurrences
- 3: 2 occurrences
- 4: 1 occurrence
- 5: 1 occurrence
Based on the condition `c[n] <= 1`, the elements that will be included in the new list are [1, 4, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 5]
