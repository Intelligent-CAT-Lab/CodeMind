<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code checks if n is less than 4. In this case, it is not, so the code continues to the next step.
The code initializes a list called results with the values [0, 0, 2, 0].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 4 to n+1 (inclusive), which means it will iterate once in this case.
In each iteration, the code appends the sum of the last four elements of the results list to the list, and then removes the first element of the list.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the last element of the results list, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
