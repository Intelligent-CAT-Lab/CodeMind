<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `truncate_number` that takes a float `number` as input and returns the remainder of `number` divided by 1.0.
In this case, the input is 3.5.
When 3.5 is divided by 1.0, the remainder is 0.5.
Therefore, the return value of `truncate_number(3.5)` would be 0.5.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
