<<<Analysis>>>
The function `change_base` takes two arguments, `x` and `base`. It initializes an empty string `ret` to store the converted number.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as `x` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of `x` divided by `base` and converts it to a string. This remainder is then concatenated with the current value of `ret`.
After that, it updates the value of `x` by performing integer division of `x` by `base`, effectively removing the last digit from `x`.
The loop continues until `x` becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates.
Finally, the function returns the value of `ret`, which is the converted number.
In this case, the function `change_base(8, 3)` converts the number 8 to base 3. The binary representation of 8 is 1000, so the function should return "1000".
