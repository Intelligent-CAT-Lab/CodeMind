<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to "Mary had a little lamb" and variable n is initialized to 4.
The code then splits the string s into a list of words using the split() function.
For each word in the list, it initializes the variable n_consonants to 0.
Then, it iterates through each character in the word and checks if it is a consonant by comparing it to the list ["a","e","i","o","u"].
If the character is not in the list, it increments the variable n_consonants by 1.
After iterating through all the characters in the word, it checks if the value of n_consonants is equal to n.
If it is, it appends the word to the result list.
Finally, it returns the result list.
In this case, the words "Mary" and "lamb" have 4 consonants each, so they will be added to the result list.
<<<Output>>>
['Mary', 'lamb']
