<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 100 and the variable shift is initialized to 2.
The code converts x to a string and assigns it to the variable s.
The code then checks if shift is greater than the length of s. In this case, the length of s is 3, so the condition is not met.
Since the condition is not met, the code enters the else block.
The code returns the concatenation of two substrings of s: s[len(s) - shift:] and s[:len(s) - shift].
s[len(s) - shift:] represents the substring starting from the index len(s) - shift to the end of s. In this case, it is "00".
s[:len(s) - shift] represents the substring starting from the beginning of s to the index len(s) - shift. In this case, it is "1".
Therefore, the code returns "001".
