<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `monotonic` that takes a list `l` as input.
The code then checks if the list `l` is equal to the sorted version of `l` or the reverse sorted version of `l`.
If either of these conditions is true, it means that the list `l` is either in ascending order or descending order, and the function returns True.
Otherwise, it returns False.
In this case, the input list [1, 2, 4, 10] is in ascending order, so the function will return True.
<<<Output>>>
True
