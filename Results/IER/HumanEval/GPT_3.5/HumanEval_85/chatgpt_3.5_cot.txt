<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add` takes a list `lst` as input.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `lst` starting from index 1 and incrementing by 2 (i.e., it considers every second element).
For each element at an even index, it checks if the element is divisible by 2 (i.e., if it is even).
If the element is even, it adds it to a new list.
Finally, the function returns the sum of the elements in the new list.
In this case, the input list is [4, 88].
The function considers the element at index 1, which is 88.
Since 88 is divisible by 2, it is added to the new list.
The new list contains only one element, which is 88.
The function returns the sum of the elements in the new list, which is 88.
<<<Output>>>
88
