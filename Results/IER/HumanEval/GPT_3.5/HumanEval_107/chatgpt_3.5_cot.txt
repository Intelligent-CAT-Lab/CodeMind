<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 123.
The code then defines a nested function is_palindrome(n) that checks if a number is a palindrome by comparing its string representation with its reverse.
The variables even_palindrome_count and odd_palindrome_count are initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of even and odd palindromes, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 123.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is odd and a palindrome. If it is, it increments odd_palindrome_count by 1.
If i is not odd, it checks if i is even and a palindrome. If it is, it increments even_palindrome_count by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns a tuple containing the values of even_palindrome_count and odd_palindrome_count, which are (0, 3) in this case.
<<<Output>>>
(0, 3)
