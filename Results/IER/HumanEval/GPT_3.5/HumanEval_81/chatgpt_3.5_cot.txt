<<<Analysis>>>
The function `numerical_letter_grade` takes a list of numerical grades as input and returns a list of corresponding letter grades.

The code initializes an empty list called `letter_grade` to store the letter grades.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over each numerical grade `gpa` in the input list `grades`.
For each `gpa`, the code checks a series of conditions using if-elif statements to determine the corresponding letter grade.
If `gpa` is equal to 4.0, it appends "A+" to the `letter_grade` list.
If `gpa` is greater than 3.7, it appends "A" to the `letter_grade` list.
If `gpa` is greater than 3.3, it appends "A-" to the `letter_grade` list.
And so on, until it reaches the condition where `gpa` is less than or equal to 0.0, in which case it appends "E" to the `letter_grade` list.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the `letter_grade` list.

In this case, the input list is [4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5].
For each numerical grade in the list, the code determines the corresponding letter grade and appends it to the `letter_grade` list.
The resulting `letter_grade` list would be ["A+", "C", "C-", "C", "A-"].

<<<Output>>>
["A+", "C", "C-", "C", "A-"]
