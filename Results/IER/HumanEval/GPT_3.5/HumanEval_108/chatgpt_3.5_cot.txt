<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `count_nums` that takes a list `arr` as input.
Inside the `count_nums` function, there is another function `digits_sum` that calculates the sum of the digits of a number.
The `digits_sum` function first checks if the number `n` is negative. If it is, it multiplies `n` by -1 and sets `neg` to -1.
Then, it converts the number `n` to a list of its digits by converting it to a string and then converting each character to an integer.
If the number was negative, it multiplies the first digit by `neg` to make it negative again.
Finally, it returns the sum of the digits.
Back in the `count_nums` function, it uses a list comprehension to apply the `digits_sum` function to each element `i` in the input list `arr`.
It then uses the `filter` function to keep only the elements that are greater than 0.
The `filter` function returns an iterator, so it is converted to a list using the `list` function.
Finally, the length of the resulting list is returned as the output of the `count_nums` function.
