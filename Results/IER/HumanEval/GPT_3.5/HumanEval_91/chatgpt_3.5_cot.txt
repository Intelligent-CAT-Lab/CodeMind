<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `is_bored` that takes a string `S` as input.
Inside the function, it imports the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions.
The code then uses the `re.split()` function to split the input string `S` into a list of sentences. The regular expression `r'[.?!]\s*'` is used as the delimiter to split the string. This regular expression matches any period, exclamation mark, or question mark followed by zero or more whitespace characters.
The resulting list of sentences is stored in the variable `sentences`.
The code then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sentence in `sentences`. For each sentence, it checks if the first two characters are equal to the string `'I '`. If they are, it adds `1` to the sum. Otherwise, it adds `0`.
Finally, the code returns the sum of the list comprehension, which represents the number of sentences that start with `'I '`.
