<<<Analysis>>>
The function `compare_one` takes two arguments `a` and `b`.
Inside the function, two temporary variables `temp_a` and `temp_b` are initialized with the values of `a` and `b` respectively.
If `temp_a` is a string, it replaces any commas with periods.
If `temp_b` is a string, it replaces any commas with periods.
Then, it converts `temp_a` and `temp_b` to float and compares them.
If the two values are equal, it returns None.
Otherwise, it returns `a` if `temp_a` is greater than `temp_b`, otherwise it returns `b`.
In this case, `a` is 1 and `b` is 2.
Since 1 is less than 2, the function will return 2.
