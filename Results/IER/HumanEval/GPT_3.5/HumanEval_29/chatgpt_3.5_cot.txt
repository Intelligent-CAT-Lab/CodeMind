<<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_by_prefix` takes in two parameters: `strings`, which is a list of strings, and `prefix`, which is a string.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `x` in `strings` and checks if `x` starts with the `prefix`.
If `x` does start with the `prefix`, it is included in the resulting list.
In this case, the input `strings` is an empty list, so there are no elements to iterate over.
Therefore, the resulting list will also be empty.
