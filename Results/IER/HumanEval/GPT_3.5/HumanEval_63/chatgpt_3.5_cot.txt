<<<Analysis>>>
The function `fibfib` takes an integer `n` as input.
The function uses recursion to calculate the nth term of the "fibfib" sequence.
If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.
If `n` is 1, the function returns 0.
If `n` is 2, the function returns 1.
For any other value of `n`, the function recursively calls itself with `n-1`, `n-2`, and `n-3` as arguments, and returns the sum of the three recursive calls.
In this case, `n` is 2, so the function will return the value of `fibfib(1) + fibfib(0) + fibfib(-1)`.
Since `fibfib(1)` returns 0 and `fibfib(0)` returns 0, the function will return 0 + 0 + fibfib(-1).
Since there is no base case for `n` being negative, the function will keep recursively calling itself with negative values of `n`, resulting in an infinite loop.
Therefore, the function will not terminate and will not return a value.
<<<Output>>>
No output, as the function does not terminate.
