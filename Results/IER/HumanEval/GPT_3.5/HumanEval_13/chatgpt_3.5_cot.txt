<<<Analysis>>>
The function `greatest_common_divisor` takes two integer arguments `a` and `b`.
The code enters a while loop with the condition `b`, which means the loop will continue as long as `b` is not zero.
Inside the loop, the code updates the values of `a` and `b` using tuple unpacking and the modulo operator.
The new value of `a` is assigned to `b`, and the new value of `b` is assigned to `a % b`.
This process continues until `b` becomes zero, at which point the loop terminates.
Finally, the function returns the value of `a`, which is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`.
In this case, the function will return 1, as the greatest common divisor of 3 and 7 is 1.
