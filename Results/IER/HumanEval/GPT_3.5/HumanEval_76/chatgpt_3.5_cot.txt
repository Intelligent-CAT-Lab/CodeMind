<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 16 and the variable n is initialized to 2.
The code then checks if n is equal to 1. In this case, it is not, so it continues to the next line.
The variable power is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as power is less than x.
Inside the loop, power is multiplied by n in each iteration.
In this case, the loop will iterate 5 times, with power taking the values 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if power is equal to x. In this case, it is not, so the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
