<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `order_by_points` that takes a list of numbers as input.
Inside the function, there is another function `digits_sum` that calculates the sum of the digits of a number.
The `digits_sum` function first checks if the number is negative. If it is, it multiplies it by -1 and sets the `neg` variable to -1.
Then, it converts the number to a list of integers by converting each digit to an integer and stores it in the variable `n`.
If the number was negative, it multiplies the first element of `n` by `neg` to make it negative again.
Finally, it returns the sum of the elements in `n`.
The `order_by_points` function uses the `sorted` function to sort the input list `nums` based on the `digits_sum` function as the key.
This means that the numbers in `nums` will be sorted based on the sum of their digits.
The sorted list is then returned as the output of the `order_by_points` function.
