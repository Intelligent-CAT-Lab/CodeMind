<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a conditional statement that checks if n is equal to 0. Since n is not equal to 0, the code continues to the next line.
The variable my_tri is initialized to [1, 3].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n+1 (inclusive), which is from 2 to 4 in this case.
For each iteration of the loop, the code checks if i is divisible by 2. If it is, it appends the value i/2 + 1 to my_tri. In this case, since i is 2, it appends the value 2/2 + 1 = 2 to my_tri.
If i is not divisible by 2, the code appends the value my_tri[i-1] + my_tri[i-2] + (i+3)/2 to my_tri. In this case, since i is 3, it appends the value my_tri[2] + my_tri[1] + (3+3)/2 = 3 + 1 + 3 = 7 to my_tri.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of my_tri, which is [1, 3, 2, 7].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 2, 7]
