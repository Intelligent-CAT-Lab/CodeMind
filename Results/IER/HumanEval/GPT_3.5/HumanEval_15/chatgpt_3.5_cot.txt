<<<Analysis>>>
The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input.
It creates a list comprehension that generates a list of strings, where each string is the string representation of a number from 0 to `n`.
Then, it uses the `join` method to concatenate all the strings in the list, separated by a space.
Finally, it returns the concatenated string.

In this case, the input `n` is 0.
The list comprehension will generate a list with a single element, which is the string representation of 0.
The `join` method will simply return this single element.
Therefore, the return value of `string_sequence(0)` will be the string '0'.
