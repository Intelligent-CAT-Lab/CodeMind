<<<Analysis>>>
The function `multiply` takes two parameters `a` and `b`.
The function calculates the absolute value of the remainder when `a` is divided by 10 and multiplies it with the absolute value of the remainder when `b` is divided by 10.
In this case, `a` is 148 and `b` is 412.
The remainder of 148 divided by 10 is 8, and the remainder of 412 divided by 10 is 2.
So, the function returns the product of 8 and 2, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
