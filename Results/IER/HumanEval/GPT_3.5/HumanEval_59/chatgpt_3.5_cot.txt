<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `largest_prime_factor` that takes an integer `n` as input.
Inside the function, there is another nested function `is_prime` that checks if a number is prime or not.
The variable `largest` is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the largest prime factor.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive), checking if each number is a factor of `n` and if it is prime.
If a number `j` is a factor of `n` and is prime, it updates the value of `largest` to be the maximum of its current value and `j`.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of `largest`, which will be the largest prime factor of `n`.
In this case, the input `n` is 15. The code checks if each number from 2 to 15 is a factor of 15 and if it is prime. The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The prime factors are 3 and 5. The largest prime factor is 5.
