<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_third` takes a list `l` as input.
First, the function converts the input list `l` into a new list `l` using the `list()` function.
Then, it sorts every third element of the list `l` using the slice notation `l[::3]` and the `sorted()` function.
Finally, the function returns the modified list `l`.

In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3].
The function converts it into a new list [1, 2, 3].
Since the list has only three elements, the sorted list will be the same as the original list.
Therefore, the return value of `tuple(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))` will be (1, 2, 3).

<<<Output>>>
(1, 2, 3)
