<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called incr_list that takes a list l as input.
Inside the function, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is incremented by 1.
The code then returns this new list.
In this case, the input list is [5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123].
The code will create a new list where each element is incremented by 1, resulting in [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124].
<<<Output>>>
[6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
