<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called starts_one_ends that takes an argument n.
The code checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, the function immediately returns 1.
If n is not equal to 1, the function calculates and returns the value 18 multiplied by 10 raised to the power of (n - 2).
In this case, n is equal to 1, so the function returns 1.
