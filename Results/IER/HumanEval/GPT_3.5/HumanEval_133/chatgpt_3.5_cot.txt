<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `sum_squares` that takes a list `lst` as input.
It imports the `math` module to use the `ceil` function.
It initializes a variable `squared` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of squared values.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element `i` in the input list `lst`.
For each element, it calculates the ceiling of `i` using the `ceil` function from the `math` module, and then squares the result.
The squared value is added to the `squared` variable.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `squared`.
In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3].
The code calculates the squared value for each element: ceil(1)**2 = 1, ceil(2)**2 = 4, ceil(3)**2 = 9.
The sum of these squared values is 1 + 4 + 9 = 14.
Therefore, the return value of `sum_squares([1, 2, 3])` is 14.
