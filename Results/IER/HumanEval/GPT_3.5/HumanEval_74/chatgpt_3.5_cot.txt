<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called total_match that takes two lists, lst1 and lst2, as input.
It initializes two variables, l1 and l2, to 0. These variables will be used to store the total length of strings in lst1 and lst2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each string, st, in lst1. For each string, it adds the length of the string to l1.
Next, it enters another loop that iterates over each string, st, in lst2. For each string, it adds the length of the string to l2.
After both loops finish, the code compares the values of l1 and l2. If l1 is less than or equal to l2, it returns lst1. Otherwise, it returns lst2.
In this case, lst1 is ['hi', 'admin'] and lst2 is ['hi', 'hi']. The total length of strings in lst1 is 7 (2 + 5) and the total length of strings in lst2 is 4 (2 + 2). Since l1 is greater than l2, the code returns lst2, which is ['hi', 'hi'].
<<<Output>>>
['hi', 'hi']
