<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `is_sorted` that takes a list `lst` as input.
Inside the function, a dictionary `count_digit` is created with the elements of `lst` as keys and initial values of 0.
Then, a loop iterates over each element `i` in `lst` and increments the corresponding value in `count_digit` by 1.
Next, the code checks if any element in `lst` has a count greater than 2 in `count_digit`. If so, it returns False.
If the above condition is not met, the code checks if all elements in `lst` are in non-decreasing order. If so, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
In this case, the input list `lst` has only one element, which means it is already sorted. Therefore, the function will return True.
<<<Output>>>
True
