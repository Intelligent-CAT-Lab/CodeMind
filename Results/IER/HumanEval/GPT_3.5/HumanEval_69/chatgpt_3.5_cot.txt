<<<Analysis>>>
The function `search` takes a list `lst` as input.
It initializes a list `frq` with length equal to the maximum value in `lst` plus 1, and fills it with zeros.
Then, it iterates over each element `i` in `lst` and increments the corresponding index in `frq` by 1.
After that, it initializes a variable `ans` to -1.
Next, it iterates over the range from 1 to the length of `frq` (excluding the first element).
For each index `i`, it checks if the value at that index in `frq` is greater than or equal to `i`.
If the condition is true, it updates `ans` to the current index `i`.
Finally, it returns the value of `ans`.

In this case, the input list is [5, 5, 5, 5, 1].
The maximum value in the list is 5, so `frq` is initialized as [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
Then, the loop iterates over each element in `lst` and increments the corresponding index in `frq`.
After this step, `frq` becomes [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4].
Next, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to the length of `frq`, which is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
At index 1, the value in `frq` is 1, which is equal to the index. So, `ans` is updated to 1.
At index 2, the value in `frq` is 0, which is not greater than or equal to the index. So, `ans` remains 1.
At index 3, the value in `frq` is 0, which is not greater than or equal to the index. So, `ans` remains 1.
At index 4, the value in `frq` is 0, which is not greater than or equal to the index. So, `ans` remains 1.
At index 5, the value in `frq` is 4, which is greater than or equal to the index. So, `ans` is updated to 5.
Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is 5.
