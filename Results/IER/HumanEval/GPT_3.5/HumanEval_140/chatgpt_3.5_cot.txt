<<<Analysis>>>
The variable text is initialized to "Example".
The code then initializes an empty string new_text, and variables i, start, and end to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates until i is less than the length of text.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the current character at index i in text is a space.
If it is, the code increments the end variable by 1.
If it is not a space, the code checks if the difference between end and start is greater than 2.
If it is, the code adds a "-" followed by the current character to new_text.
If the difference is not greater than 2, the code checks if the difference is greater than 0.
If it is, the code adds "_" multiplied by the difference, followed by the current character to new_text.
If the difference is not greater than 0, the code simply adds the current character to new_text.
The code then updates the start and end variables to i+1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the difference between end and start is greater than 2.
If it is, the code adds a "-" to new_text.
If the difference is not greater than 2, the code checks if the difference is greater than 0.
If it is, the code adds "_" to new_text.
Finally, the code returns the value of new_text.
In this case, the input "Example" does not contain any spaces, so the code does not modify the text and returns the original string "Example".
