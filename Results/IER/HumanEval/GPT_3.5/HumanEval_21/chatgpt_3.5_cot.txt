<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of floats as input and returns a list of floats.
Inside the function, it first finds the minimum and maximum numbers in the input list using the `min()` and `max()` functions, respectively.
Then, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and rescale it to the unit interval [0, 1] using the formula `(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number)`.
The rescaled numbers are stored in a new list, which is then returned as the output of the function.
In this case, the input list is [2.0, 49.9]. The minimum number is 2.0 and the maximum number is 49.9.
Using the formula, the rescaled numbers would be [(2.0 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0), (49.9 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0)], which simplifies to [0.0, 1.0].
