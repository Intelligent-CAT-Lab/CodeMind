<<<Analysis>>>
The function `solve` takes an integer `N` as input.
The code converts `N` to a string and iterates over each character in the string.
For each character, it converts it to an integer and sums them up.
The sum is then converted to its binary representation using the `bin` function.
The binary representation is a string that starts with '0b', so the code slices the string from the 3rd character onwards to remove the '0b' prefix.
The resulting binary representation is returned as the output.
In this case, the input `N` is 1000. The sum of its digits is 1+0+0+0 = 1. The binary representation of 1 is '0b1', so the output is '1'.
