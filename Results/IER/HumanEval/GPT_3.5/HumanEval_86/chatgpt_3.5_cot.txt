<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and splits it into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter.
For each word in the list, it converts it into a list of characters, sorts the characters in ascending order, and then joins them back into a single string.
Finally, it joins all the modified words back into a single string using the space character as the delimiter and returns the result.
In this case, the input string is 'Hi', which is split into a list containing a single word ['Hi'].
The word 'Hi' is converted into a list of characters ['H', 'i'], sorted in ascending order ['H', 'i'], and then joined back into a single string 'Hi'.
The modified word 'Hi' is then joined with the space character to form the final result 'Hi'.
<<<Output>>>
'Hi'
