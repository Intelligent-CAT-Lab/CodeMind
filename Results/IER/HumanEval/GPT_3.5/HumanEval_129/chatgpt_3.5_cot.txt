<<<Analysis>>>
The variable grid is initialized to [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] and variable k is initialized to 3.
The code first calculates the length of the grid and stores it in the variable n, which is 3 in this case.
The variable val is initialized to n * n + 1, which is 10 in this case.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over each element in the grid.
For each element, if it is equal to 1, the code creates an empty list called temp.
The code then checks if the current element is not in the first row, and if so, appends the element above it to temp.
Next, the code checks if the current element is not in the first column, and if so, appends the element to the left of it to temp.
Similarly, the code checks if the current element is not in the last row, and if so, appends the element below it to temp.
Finally, the code checks if the current element is not in the last column, and if so, appends the element to the right of it to temp.
After the nested loop finishes, the code calculates the minimum value in temp and assigns it to val.
The code then creates an empty list called ans.
The code enters another loop that iterates k times.
For each iteration, if the current index i is divisible by 2, the code appends 1 to ans.
Otherwise, it appends the value of val to ans.
Finally, the code returns ans, which is [1, 10, 1] in this case.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 10, 1]
