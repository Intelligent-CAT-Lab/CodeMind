<<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_row` takes two arguments: `lst` and `x`. 
The variable `coords` is initialized as an empty list.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the elements of `lst`. 
For each element, it checks if it is equal to `x`. If it is, it appends the coordinates `(i, j)` of the element to `coords`, where `i` is the index of the row and `j` is the index of the column.
Finally, the function returns `coords` after sorting it first by the column index in descending order and then by the row index in ascending order.

In this case, `lst` is an empty list, so the nested loop will not execute and `coords` will remain an empty list.
The function will then return the empty list `[]`.
