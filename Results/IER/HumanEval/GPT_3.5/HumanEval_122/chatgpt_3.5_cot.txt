<<<Analysis>>>
The function `add_elements` takes two arguments: `arr` and `k`.
It returns the sum of elements in `arr` up to the `k`th element, but only if the length of the element (when converted to a string) is less than or equal to 2.

In this case, the input `arr` is [1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99] and `k` is 3.
The function will iterate over the first 3 elements of `arr` (1, -2, -3) and check if their length (when converted to a string) is less than or equal to 2.
Since all three elements meet this condition, they will be included in the sum.
The sum of these elements is 1 + (-2) + (-3) = -4.

<<<Output>>>
-4
