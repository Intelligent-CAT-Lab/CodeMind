The code defines a function called minSubArraySum that takes a list of numbers as input.
The variable max_sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum subarray sum.
The variable s is also initialized to 0, which will be used to calculate the current subarray sum.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each number in the input list.
For each number, it subtracts the number from s and checks if s becomes negative.
If s becomes negative, it means that the current subarray sum is less than 0, so it resets s to 0.
After that, it updates max_sum to be the maximum value between s and max_sum.
This process continues for each number in the input list, updating s and max_sum accordingly.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if max_sum is still 0. If it is, it means that all numbers in the input list are negative.
In this case, it calculates the maximum negative number in the input list and assigns it to max_sum.
Finally, it calculates min_sum by negating max_sum and returns it.
In this case, the input list is [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4].
The code iterates over each number and updates s and max_sum as follows:
- For the first number 2, s becomes -2 and max_sum becomes 0.
- For the second number 3, s becomes -5 and max_sum becomes 0.
- For the third number 4, s becomes -9 and max_sum becomes 0.
- For the fourth number 1, s becomes -10 and max_sum becomes 0.
- For the fifth number 2, s becomes -8 and max_sum becomes 0.
- For the sixth number 4, s becomes -4 and max_sum becomes 0.
Since max_sum is still 0 after the loop finishes, it means that all numbers in the input list are negative.
Therefore, max_sum is updated to be the maximum negative number in the input list, which is -1.
Finally, min_sum is calculated by negating max_sum, which is 1, and returned.
