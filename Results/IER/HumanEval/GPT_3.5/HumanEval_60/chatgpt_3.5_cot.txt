<<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_to_n` takes an integer `n` as input.
It uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
Then, it uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the generated sequence.
In this case, `n` is 1, so the sequence generated by `range(n + 1)` is [0, 1].
The `sum` function calculates the sum of this sequence, which is 0 + 1 = 1.
Therefore, the return value of `sum_to_n(1)` is 1.
