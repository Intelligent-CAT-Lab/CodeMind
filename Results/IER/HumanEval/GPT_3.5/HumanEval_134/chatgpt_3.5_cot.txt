<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and splits it into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter. It then selects the last word from the list using the index -1. 
The code checks if the length of the last word is equal to 1 and if the ASCII value of the lowercase version of the last character is between 97 and 122 (inclusive). 
If both conditions are true, the code returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
In this case, the input string is "apple". The last word is "apple" and the last character is "e". The length of the last word is 5, which is not equal to 1. Therefore, the code will return False.
<<<Output>>>
