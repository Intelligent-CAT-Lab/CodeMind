<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of float numbers as input.
Inside the function, it calculates the mean of the numbers by summing them and dividing by the length of the list.
Then, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each number and the mean, using a generator expression.
Finally, it divides this sum by the length of the list to get the mean absolute deviation.
The function returns this value.
In this case, the input list is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0].
The mean of these numbers is (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0) / 3 = 2.0.
The sum of the absolute differences between each number and the mean is |1.0 - 2.0| + |2.0 - 2.0| + |3.0 - 2.0| = 1.0 + 0.0 + 1.0 = 2.0.
The mean absolute deviation is 2.0 / 3 = 0.6666666666666666.
<<<Output>>>
0.6666666666666666
