<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `remove_vowels` that takes a string `text` as input.
Inside the function, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character `s` in the string `text`.
For each character, it checks if the lowercase version of `s` is not in the list `["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]`, which represents the vowels.
If the condition is true, it adds the character `s` to a new list.
Finally, it uses the `join` method to concatenate all the characters in the new list into a single string and returns it.

In this case, the input string is 'fedcba'.
The code iterates over each character in the string and checks if it is a vowel.
Since none of the characters 'f', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a' are vowels, they are all added to the new list.
The new list is then joined into a single string, resulting in the string 'fdbc'.
Therefore, the return value of `remove_vowels('fedcba')` is 'fdbc'.
<<<Output>>>
'fdbc'
