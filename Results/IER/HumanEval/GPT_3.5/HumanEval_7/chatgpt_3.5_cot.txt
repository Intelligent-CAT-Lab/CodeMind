<<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_by_substring` takes in two parameters: `strings`, which is a list of strings, and `substring`, which is a string.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `x` in the `strings` list.
For each element `x`, it checks if the `substring` is present in `x` using the `in` operator.
If the `substring` is present in `x`, it adds `x` to the resulting list.
In this case, the `strings` list is empty, so there are no elements to iterate over.
Therefore, the resulting list will also be empty.
