<<<Analysis>>>
The function `intersection` takes two intervals as input: `interval1` and `interval2`.
The function also defines an inner function `is_prime` that checks if a number is prime.

The code then initializes the variable `l` to the maximum of the first element of `interval1` and `interval2`, and initializes the variable `r` to the minimum of the second element of `interval1` and `interval2`.
The variable `length` is then calculated as the difference between `r` and `l`.

The code checks if `length` is greater than 0 and if it is a prime number using the `is_prime` function.
If both conditions are true, the function returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

In this case, `interval1` is (1, 2) and `interval2` is (2, 3).
The maximum of the first elements is 2 and the minimum of the second elements is 2.
Therefore, `l` is 2 and `r` is 2.
The length is 2 - 2 = 0, which is not greater than 0.
Therefore, the function returns "NO".
