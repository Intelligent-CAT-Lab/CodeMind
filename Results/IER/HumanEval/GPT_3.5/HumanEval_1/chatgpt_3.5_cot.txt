<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'.
The code initializes an empty list called result, which will store the separate groups of parentheses.
It also initializes an empty list called current_string, which will store the current group of parentheses being processed.
The variable current_depth is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the current depth of parentheses.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string.
If the character is '(', the current_depth is incremented by 1 and the character is appended to the current_string.
If the character is ')', the current_depth is decremented by 1 and the character is appended to the current_string.

After appending the character, the code checks if the current_depth is 0. If it is, it means that a complete group of parentheses has been processed and the current_string is added to the result list. The current_string is then cleared to start processing the next group.

The loop continues until all characters in the input string have been processed.

Finally, the code returns the result list, which contains the separate groups of parentheses.

<<<Output>>>
['(()())', '((()))', '()', '((())()())']
