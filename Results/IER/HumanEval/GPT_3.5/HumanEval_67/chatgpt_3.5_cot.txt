<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to "5 apples and 6 oranges" and the variable n is initialized to 19.
The code initializes an empty list called lis.
The code then splits the string s by spaces and iterates over each element.
For each element i, the code checks if it is a digit using the isdigit() function.
If i is a digit, it is converted to an integer using the int() function and appended to the lis list.
After iterating over all elements in s, the code calculates the sum of the elements in lis using the sum() function.
Finally, the code subtracts the sum of lis from n and returns the result.
In this case, the sum of lis is 11 (5 + 6), so the return value of the function would be 19 - 11 = 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
