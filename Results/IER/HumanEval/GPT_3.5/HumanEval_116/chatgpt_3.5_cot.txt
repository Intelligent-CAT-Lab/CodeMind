<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `sort_array` that takes an array `arr` as input.
The function first sorts the array `arr` using the `sorted` function, which returns a new sorted list.
Then, it sorts the sorted list again using the `sorted` function, but this time it uses a key function to determine the order.
The key function is defined using a lambda function, which takes each element `x` in the list and converts it to its binary representation using `bin(x)`.
The binary representation is then converted to a string using `[2:]` to remove the leading '0b' characters.
Finally, the lambda function counts the number of '1' characters in the binary string using the `count` method.
This count is used as the key for sorting the list.
Therefore, the list is sorted based on the number of '1' characters in the binary representation of each element.
The sorted list is then returned as the output of the function.
