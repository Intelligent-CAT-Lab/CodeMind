<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called is_equal_to_sum_even that takes an argument n.
The function returns True if n is an even number and is greater than or equal to 8, and False otherwise.
In this case, the input value is 4, which is not an even number. Therefore, the function will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
