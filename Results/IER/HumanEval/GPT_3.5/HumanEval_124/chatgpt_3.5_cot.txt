<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called valid_date that takes a string parameter called date.
The code first removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the date string using the strip() method.
Then, it splits the date string into three parts (month, day, and year) using the '-' character as the delimiter.
The code then converts the month, day, and year strings into integers using the int() function.
Next, the code checks if the month is less than 1 or greater than 12. If it is, the function returns False.
Then, the code checks if the month is in the list [1,3,5,7,8,10,12] and if the day is less than 1 or greater than 31. If both conditions are true, the function returns False.
Next, the code checks if the month is in the list [4,6,9,11] and if the day is less than 1 or greater than 30. If both conditions are true, the function returns False.
Finally, the code checks if the month is 2 (February) and if the day is less than 1 or greater than 29. If both conditions are true, the function returns False.
If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns True, indicating that the date is valid.
