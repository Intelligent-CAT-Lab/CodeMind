<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called next_smallest that takes a list as input.
Inside the function, the code first removes duplicates from the list by converting it to a set and then sorting it.
If the length of the sorted list is less than 2, meaning there is only one unique element in the list, the function returns None.
Otherwise, the function returns the second smallest element in the sorted list.
In this case, the input list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] has no duplicates and is already sorted in ascending order.
Therefore, the function will return the second smallest element, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
