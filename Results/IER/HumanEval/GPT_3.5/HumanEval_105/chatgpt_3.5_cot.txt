<<<Analysis>>>
The input list is [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3].
The code initializes a dictionary called dic, which maps integers to their corresponding string representation.
The code then sorts the input list in descending order and stores it in the variable sorted_arr.
A new empty list called new_arr is created.
The code then iterates over each element var in sorted_arr.
Inside the loop, it tries to append the corresponding string representation of var to new_arr by using the dic dictionary.
If var is not a key in dic, it raises a KeyError exception, which is caught by the except block and ignored.
Finally, the code returns new_arr, which contains the string representations of the elements in sorted_arr that are keys in dic.
<<<Output>>>
['Eight', 'Five', 'Four', 'Three', 'Two', 'One']
