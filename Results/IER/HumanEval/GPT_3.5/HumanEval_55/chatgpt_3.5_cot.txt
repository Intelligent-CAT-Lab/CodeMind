<<<Analysis>>>
The function `fib` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Fibonacci number.
The code first checks if `n` is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 0.
Then it checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, it returns 1.
If neither of these conditions is met, it recursively calls the `fib` function with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and returns the sum of the two results.
This recursion continues until `n` becomes 0 or 1, at which point the function starts returning the Fibonacci numbers in reverse order, summing them up until it reaches the original `n` value.
In this case, `fib(10)` will return the 10th Fibonacci number, which is 55.
<<<Output>>>
55
