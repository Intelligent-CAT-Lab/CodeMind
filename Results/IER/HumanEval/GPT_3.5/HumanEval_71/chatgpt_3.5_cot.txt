<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 3, 4, and 5, respectively.
The code then checks if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is less than or equal to the third side. If this condition is true, it means that the triangle is not valid and the code returns -1.
In this case, the condition is not true, so the code proceeds to calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula.
First, it calculates the semi-perimeter s by adding all three sides and dividing by 2.
Then, it calculates the area using the formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)).
Finally, it rounds the area to 2 decimal places and returns it.
In this case, the area of the triangle is 6.0.
<<<Output>>>
6.0
