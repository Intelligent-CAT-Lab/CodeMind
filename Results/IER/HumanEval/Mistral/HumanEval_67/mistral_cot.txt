 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `fruit_distribution` takes two arguments: `s` and `n`. `s` is a string that contains information about the fruits, and `n` is the total number of fruits.
The function first initializes an empty list called `lis`.
It then loops through each word in the string `s`, which is separated by spaces.
For each word, it checks if it is a digit using the `isdigit()` method. If it is, it converts the word to an integer using the `int()` method and appends it to the list `lis`.
After the loop finishes, the function calculates the total number of fruits in the list `lis` using the `sum()` function.
Finally, it subtracts the total number of fruits from the total number of fruits (`n`) and returns the result.
