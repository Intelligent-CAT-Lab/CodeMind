 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `same_chars` takes two string arguments `s0` and `s1`. It returns `True` if the two strings have the same characters and `False` otherwise.
The function first converts both strings to sets using the `set()` function. Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements.
The `==` operator checks if two sets are equal, meaning they have the same elements and the same order.
The function then returns the result of the comparison.
