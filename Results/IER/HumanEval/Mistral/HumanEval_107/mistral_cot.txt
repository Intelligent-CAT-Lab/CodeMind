 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `even_odd_palindrome` takes an integer `n` as input.
It first defines an inner function `is_palindrome` that checks if a number is a palindrome by comparing its string representation with its reverse string representation.
The function then initializes two variables `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count` to 0, which will be used to count the number of even and odd palindromes, respectively.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is odd and a palindrome, or if i is even and a palindrome. If it is, it increments the corresponding count variable.
After the loop finishes, the function returns a tuple containing the values of `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count`.
