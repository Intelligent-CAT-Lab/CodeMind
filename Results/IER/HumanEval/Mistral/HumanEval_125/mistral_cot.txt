<<<Analysis>>>
The function `split_words` takes a string `txt` as input.
The first `if` statement checks if the string contains a space. If it does, the function returns the string split using the `split()` method.
The second `elif` statement checks if the string contains a comma. If it does, the function replaces the comma with a space and then splits the string using the `split()` method.
The third `else` statement checks if the string contains any lowercase letters that are even. If it does, the function returns the length of the list of these characters.
For the input "Hello world!", the first `if` statement is not met, so the code moves to the second `elif` statement. The comma in the input string is replaced with a space, and the resulting string "Hello world" is split into a list using the `split()` method. The output of the function is a list containing the two elements "Hello" and "world".
<<<Output>>>
["Hello", "world"]
