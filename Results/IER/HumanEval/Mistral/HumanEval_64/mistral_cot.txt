The function `vowels_count` takes a string `s` as input.
It first initializes a variable `vowels` to the string "aeiouAEIOU", which contains all the vowels.
It then uses a generator expression to count the number of vowels in the input string `s`. The generator expression checks if each character `c` in `s` is in the `vowels` string using the `in` operator. The `sum` function is used to add up all the `True` values returned by the generator expression.
The function then checks if the last character of the string is 'y' or 'Y'. If it is, it adds 1 to the count of vowels because 'y' and 'Y' are considered vowels.
Finally, the function returns the count of vowels.
