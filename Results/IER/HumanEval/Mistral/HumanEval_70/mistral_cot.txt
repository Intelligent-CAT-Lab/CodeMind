 <<<Analysis>>>
The function strange_sort_list takes a list as input and returns a new sorted list.
The function starts by initializing two variables: res, which is an empty list that will be used to store the sorted elements, and switch, which is set to True.
The while loop runs as long as the input list lst is not empty.
Inside the loop, the function appends the minimum element of the list if switch is True, or the maximum element of the list if switch is False.
Then it removes the last element from the list, which is the element that was just appended.
Finally, it toggles the value of switch.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the sorted list res.
