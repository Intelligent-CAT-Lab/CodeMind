 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `rounded_avg` takes two arguments, n and m.
The function first checks if m is less than n, if so it returns -1.
Otherwise, it initializes a variable `summation` to 0 and then uses a for loop to iterate from n to m+1, adding each number to the summation variable.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the average of the summation by dividing it by (m - n + 1) and then rounds it to the nearest integer using the built-in `round()` function.
Finally, it converts the rounded integer to binary using the built-in `bin()` function and returns the result.
<<<Output>>>
-1
