 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_palindrome` takes a string as input and returns a boolean value.
The function iterates through the characters of the string from both ends, comparing each character with its corresponding character from the other end.
If any pair of characters does not match, the function returns False immediately.
If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, the function returns True.
In the case of the input 'xywyx', the first character is 'x' and the last character is 'x'. The second character is 'y' and the second last character is 'y'. The third character is 'w' and the third last character is 'w'. The fourth character is 'y' and the fourth last character is 'y'. The fifth character is 'w' and the fifth last character is 'x'. Since all pairs of characters match, the function returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
