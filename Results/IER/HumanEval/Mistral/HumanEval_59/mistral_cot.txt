 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `largest_prime_factor` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest prime factor of `n`.
The function `is_prime` takes an integer `k` as input and returns `True` if `k` is prime, and `False` otherwise.
The function `largest_prime_factor` first initializes the variable `largest` to 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n + 1.
For each number `j` in this range, it checks if `n` is divisible by `j` and if `j` is prime. If both conditions are met, it updates the value of `largest` to be the maximum of `largest` and `j`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of `largest`.
For the input `n = 15`, the function first checks if 15 is divisible by 2, which is True. Since 2 is prime, it updates the value of `largest` to be 2.
It then checks if 15 is divisible by 3, which is True. Since 3 is prime, it updates the value of `largest` to be 3.
Since 15 is not divisible by any other number in the range [2, 15], the function returns 3 as the largest prime factor of 15.
