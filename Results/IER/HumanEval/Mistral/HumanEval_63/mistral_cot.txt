 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `fibfib` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.
The function first checks if `n` is 0, 1 or 2. If it is, it returns 0, 0 or 1, respectively.
If `n` is not one of these values, the function calls itself recursively with the arguments `n - 1`, `n - 2` and `n - 3`, and adds the results together.
The recursion continues until `n` is 0, 1 or 2, at which point the function returns the sum of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.
