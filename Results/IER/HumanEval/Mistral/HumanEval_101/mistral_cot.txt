 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string s as input.
It first checks if s is empty, if so it returns an empty list.
It then initializes an empty list s\_list.
It iterates over each letter in s.
If the letter is a comma, it appends a space to s\_list.
Otherwise, it appends the letter to s\_list.
After the loop finishes, it joins the elements of s\_list with a space using the join() method.
Finally, it splits the resulting string into a list of words using the split() method and returns the list.
<<<Output>>>
['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']
