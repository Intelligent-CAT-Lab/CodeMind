 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `match_parens` takes a list of strings as input. It first defines a helper function `check` that takes a string as input and checks if the number of opening parentheses is equal to the number of closing parentheses. If it is, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
The main function then creates two strings S1 and S2 by concatenating the first two elements of the input list in two different orders. It then calls the `check` function on both S1 and S2 and returns 'Yes' if either of them is True, otherwise it returns 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
