 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_multiply_prime` takes an integer `a` as input.
It first defines an inner function `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is prime, and `False` otherwise.
The inner function uses a loop to check if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to `n-1`. If it is, it returns `False`. If it is not divisible by any number from 2 to `n-1`, it returns `True`.
The outer function `is_multiply_prime` uses three nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of three integers from 2 to 100.
For each combination, it checks if the product of the three integers is equal to `a`. If it is, it returns `True`. If it is not, it continues to the next combination.
If no combination is found that satisfies the condition, the function returns `False`.
