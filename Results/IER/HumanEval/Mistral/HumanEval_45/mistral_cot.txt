<<<Analysis>>>
The function `triangle_area` takes two arguments: `a` and `h`.
`a` is the base of the triangle and `h` is the height of the triangle.
The function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `(base * height) / 2`.
In this case, `a` is 5 and `h` is 3, so the formula becomes `(5 * 3) / 2 = 7.5`.
<<<Output>>>
7.5
