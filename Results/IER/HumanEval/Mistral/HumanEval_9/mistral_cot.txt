 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `rolling_max` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list of integers.
The function initializes two variables: `running_max` and `result`.
`running_max` is initialized to `None`, which means that initially, the maximum value is not set.
`result` is initialized as an empty list, which will be used to store the maximum value of the current window.
The function then iterates over the input list `numbers`.
For each number `n` in the list, it checks if `running_max` is `None`. If it is, it sets `running_max` to `n`. This means that the maximum value of the current window is `n`.
If `running_max` is not `None`, it updates `running_max` to the maximum of `running_max` and `n`. This means that the maximum value of the current window is either `n` or the maximum of the previous window and the current number.
After the loop finishes, the function appends the current value of `running_max` to the `result` list. This means that the `result` list contains the maximum value of each window of size 1.
Finally, the function returns the `result` list.
