 <<<Analysis>>>
The function fizz_buzz takes an integer n as input.
It initializes an empty list ns, which will be used to store the numbers that meet the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 50.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulo operator (%). If it is, it appends i to the list ns.
After the loop finishes, the code converts the list ns to a string using the join() method and stores it in the variable s.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over each character in the string s. If the character is '7', it increments the variable ans.
Finally, the code returns the value of ans.
