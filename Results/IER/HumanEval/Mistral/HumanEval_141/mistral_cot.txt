 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `file_name_check` takes a string as input, which is the file name.
The function first creates a list of allowed file extensions, which is ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'].
It then splits the input string by the dot character, which separates the file name and extension. The resulting list is stored in the variable `lst`.
The function checks if the length of the list is 2, which is true in this case.
It then checks if the last element of the list (i.e., the file extension) is in the allowed list of extensions. In this case, it is 'txt', which is in the allowed list.
The function then checks if the first element of the list (i.e., the file name) is empty. In this case, it is not empty.
The function then checks if the first character of the file name is a letter. In this case, it is 'e', which is a letter.
The function then counts the number of digits in the file name. In this case, there are 0 digits.
The function then checks if the number of digits is greater than 3. In this case, it is not greater than 3.
The function returns 'Yes' if all the conditions are met, which is the case in this example.
<<<Output>>>
