 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `triangle_area` takes three arguments, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle.
The function first checks if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side, which is a necessary condition for a triangle to exist. If any of the conditions `a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a` is true, the function returns -1, indicating that the input is invalid.
If the input is valid, the function calculates the semi-perimeter of the triangle, which is `(a + b + c)/2`. It then calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula, which is `(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5`. The area is then rounded to two decimal places using the `round()` function.
Finally, the function returns the calculated area.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `triangle_area(3, 4, 5)` is 6.0.
