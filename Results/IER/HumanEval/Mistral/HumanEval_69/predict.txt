The return value of `search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])` is 5.
This is because the input list contains 5 elements, and the maximum value in the list is 5. The `frq` list is initialized as [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. After iterating through the input list, the `frq` list becomes [5, 5, 5, 5, 1]. The function then iterates through the `frq` list and finds that `frq[5]` is greater than or equal to 5, so it sets `ans` to 5. Finally, the function returns 5.
