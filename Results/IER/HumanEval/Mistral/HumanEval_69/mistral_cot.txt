 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `search` takes a list `lst` as input.
It first initializes a list `frq` of length equal to the maximum value in the input list plus one.
It then iterates through the input list and for each element `i`, it increments the corresponding element in the `frq` list by 1.
The function then iterates through the `frq` list and for each element `i`, it checks if `i` is greater than or equal to the current value of `i` in the `frq` list. If it is, it sets the variable `ans` to `i`.
Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])` is 5.
This is because the input list contains 5 elements, and the maximum value in the list is 5. The `frq` list is initialized as [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. After iterating through the input list, the `frq` list becomes [5, 5, 5, 5, 1]. The function then iterates through the `frq` list and finds that `frq[5]` is greater than or equal to 5, so it sets `ans` to 5. Finally, the function returns 5.
