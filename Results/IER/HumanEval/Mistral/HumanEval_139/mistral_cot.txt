 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `special_factorial` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the special factorial of that number.
The variable `fact_i` is initialized to 1 and will be used to calculate the factorial of each number from 1 to n.
The variable `special_fact` is also initialized to 1 and will be used to calculate the special factorial.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will calculate the factorial of each number from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in `fact_i`.
Then it multiplies the current value of `special_fact` by the current value of `fact_i` and stores the result in `special_fact`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `special_fact`, which is 24.
<<<Output>>>
24
