 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `change_base` takes two arguments: `x` and `base`. `x` is an integer and `base` is an integer.
The function uses a while loop to repeatedly divide `x` by `base` and append the remainder to the string `ret`. The remainder is converted to a string using the `str()` function.
The loop continues until `x` becomes 0.
The final value of `ret` is returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `change_base(8, 3)` is "210".
