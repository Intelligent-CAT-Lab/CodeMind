 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `cycpattern_check` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`.
The length of `b` is calculated using the `len()` function and stored in the variable `l`.
The variable `pat` is set to the concatenation of `b` and `b`.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from the index `i` to `len(a) - l + 1` (inclusive).
For each iteration of this loop, it enters another loop that iterates from the index `j` to `l + 1` (inclusive).
Inside this loop, it checks if the substring `a[i:i+l]` is equal to the substring `pat[j:j+l]`. If it is, the function returns `True`.
After both loops finish, if no matching pattern is found, the function returns `False`.
