 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `tri` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of integers.
The function first checks if `n` is equal to 0, in which case it returns the list `[1]`.
Otherwise, it initializes a list `my_tri` with the first two elements `[1, 3]`.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `n + 1` (inclusive).
For each odd number `i` in this range, it calculates the next element of the list by adding the previous two elements and dividing by 2.
For each even number `i` in this range, it calculates the next element of the list by adding the previous two elements and adding 3.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the list `my_tri`.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
