 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `correct_bracketing` takes a string `brackets` as input.
It initializes a variable `depth` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current depth of the brackets.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in the string `brackets`.
If the character is "<", the depth is incremented by 1.
If the character is ">", the depth is decremented by 1.
If the depth becomes negative at any point, the function returns False, indicating that the brackets are not correctly bracketed.
After the loop finishes, the function checks if the depth is 0. If it is, the brackets are correctly bracketed and the function returns True.
<<<Output>>>
True
