The function `get_closest_vowel` takes a string as input and returns the closest vowel to the middle of the string.
The function first checks if the length of the string is less than 3, in which case it returns an empty string.
It then creates a dictionary of vowels, both uppercase and lowercase.
The function then iterates over the string from the end to the beginning, checking if the current character is a vowel. If it is, it checks if the two characters on either side of it are not vowels. If this condition is met, it returns the current character as the closest vowel to the middle of the string.
If no such condition is met, it returns an empty string.
For the input "yogurt", the function first checks if the length is less than 3, which is not the case.
It then iterates over the string from the end to the beginning, checking if the current character is a vowel. The first character is 'y', which is not a vowel, so it moves to the next character. The second character is 'o', which is a vowel, so it checks if the two characters on either side of it are not vowels. The third character is 'g', which is not a vowel, so it moves to the next character. The fourth character is 'u', which is a vowel, so it checks if the two characters on either side of it are not vowels. The fifth character is 'r', which is not a vowel, so it moves to the next character. The sixth character is 't', which is not a vowel, so it moves to the next character. The seventh character is ' ', which is not a vowel, so it moves to the next character. The eighth character is 'y', which is not a vowel, so it moves to the next character. The ninth character is 'o', which is a vowel, so it checks if the two characters on either side of it are not vowels. The tenth character is 'g', which is not a vowel, so it moves to the next character. The eleventh character is 'u', which is a vowel, so it checks if the two characters on either side of it are not vowels
