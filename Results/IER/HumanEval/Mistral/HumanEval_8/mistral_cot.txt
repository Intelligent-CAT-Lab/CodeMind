 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_product` takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing two values: the sum of the numbers in the list and the product of the numbers in the list.
The variable `sum_value` is initialized to 0 and will be used to accumulate the sum of the numbers in the list.
The variable `prod_value` is initialized to 1 and will be used to accumulate the product of the numbers in the list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each number in the input list.
For each number, it adds it to the sum\_value and multiplies it with the prod\_value.
After the loop finishes, the code returns a tuple containing the sum\_value and prod\_value.
