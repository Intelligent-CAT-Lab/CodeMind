 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `order_by_points` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list of integers sorted in descending order based on the sum of their digits.
The function first defines an inner function `digits_sum` that takes an integer as input and returns the sum of its digits.
The `digits_sum` function first checks if the input number is negative, and if so, negates it and changes its sign to -1.
It then converts the number to a list of integers by iterating over its digits and converting each digit to an integer.
The first digit is multiplied by -1 if the number is negative, to ensure that the sum of digits is positive.
Finally, the function returns the sum of the digits.
The `order_by_points` function then uses the `sorted` function to sort the input list `nums` in descending order based on the sum of their digits, using the `digits_sum` function as the key function.
<<<Output>>>
[-12, -11, -1, 11, 1]
