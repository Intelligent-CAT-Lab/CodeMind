 <<<Analysis>>>
The function encrypt takes a string s as input.
It initializes a string d, which is the alphabet in lowercase.
It initializes an empty string out, which will be used to store the encrypted string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c in s.
For each character c, it checks if it is in the string d. If it is, it calculates the index of c in d and adds 2*2 to it. This gives the index of the character that is two positions after c in the alphabet. If this index is greater than 25, it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.
It then adds the character at this new index to out.
If c is not in the string d, it simply adds it to out without any encryption.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the encrypted string out.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `encrypt('hi')` is 'k'.
