 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `int_to_mini_roman` takes an integer `number` as input and returns a string representing the number in Roman numerals.
The function first initializes two lists: `num` and `sym`. `num` contains the values of the Roman numerals in descending order, while `sym` contains the corresponding symbols.
The variable `i` is initialized to 12, which is the index of the last value in the `num` list.
The function then enters a while loop that continues until the input number `number` is 0.
Inside the loop, the function calculates the quotient `div` by dividing `number` by the current value in the `num` list. The remainder `number % num[i]` is then calculated.
The function then enters another while loop that continues until `div` is 0. Inside this loop, the function appends the corresponding symbol from the `sym` list to the `res` string. The value of `div` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
After both loops finish, the function returns the `res` string, which is converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method.
For the input `19`, the function first calculates `div` as 19 // 1000 = 0, and `number % 1000` as 9. Since 9 is not divisible by any value in the `num` list, the function appends the symbol "M" to `res`.
Then, `div` is calculated as 9 // 900 = 0, and `number % 900` as 0. Since 0 is divisible by any value in the `num` list, the function appends the symbol "CM" to `res`.
Finally, `div` is calculated as 0 // 100 = 0, and `number % 100` as 9. Since 9 is not divisible by any value in the `num` list, the function appends the symbol "XC" to `res`.
The function then returns the `res` string, which is "mcmxc".
<<<Output>>>
"mcmxc"
