 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_nested` takes a string as input and returns a boolean value.
The function first initializes two empty lists, `opening_bracket_index` and `closing_bracket_index`, which will be used to keep track of the indices of opening and closing brackets, respectively.
It then iterates through each character in the string using a for loop.
If the character is a left bracket, it appends its index to `opening_bracket_index`.
If the character is a right bracket, it appends its index to `closing_bracket_index`.
After the loop finishes, the function reverses the `closing_bracket_index` list.
It then initializes a counter variable `cnt` to 0 and an index variable `i` to 0.
It iterates through the `opening_bracket_index` list and checks if the current index `i` is less than the length of `closing_bracket_index` and if the current index `idx` is less than the next closing bracket index `closing_bracket_index[i]`.
If both conditions are true, it increments the counter variable `cnt` and increments the index variable `i`.
Finally, the function returns `cnt >= 2`, which means that the string must have at least two pairs of brackets.
