 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `closest_integer` takes a string as input and returns the closest integer to the given string.
The function first removes any trailing zeros from the string using a while loop.
Then it converts the string to a float and checks if the last two characters of the string are ".5". If they are, it checks if the number is positive or negative and returns either ceil or floor accordingly.
If the last two characters are not ".5", it checks if the length of the string is greater than 0 and returns the integer obtained by rounding the number to the nearest integer.
If the length of the string is 0, it returns 0.
