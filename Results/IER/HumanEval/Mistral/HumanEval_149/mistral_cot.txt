 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sorted_list_sum` takes a list `lst` as input.
The first line of the function sorts the list `lst` in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
The second line creates an empty list `new_lst` that will be used to store the even numbers from the sorted list.
The third line iterates over the sorted list `lst` and checks if the length of each element is even using the modulo operator `%`. If the length is even, the element is appended to the `new_lst`.
The fourth line sorts the `new_lst` in ascending order using the `sorted()` function with the `key` parameter set to `len`, which means the elements will be sorted based on their length.
The final return value of the function is the sorted `new_lst`.
<<<Output>>>
['a', 'aa']
