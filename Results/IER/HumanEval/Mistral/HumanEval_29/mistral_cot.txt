 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_by_prefix` takes two arguments: `strings` and `prefix`. `strings` is a list of strings, and `prefix` is a string that will be used to filter the list.
The function uses a list comprehension to filter the list of strings based on the prefix. The list comprehension iterates over each string in the list and checks if it starts with the prefix using the `startswith()` method. If it does, the string is added to a new list that will be returned.
In this case, the input list is empty, so the function will return an empty list.
