The function `prime_fib` takes an integer `n` as input.
The function first imports the `math` module.
The function `is_prime` is defined as a helper function that takes an integer `p` as input and returns `True` if `p` is prime, and `False` otherwise.
The function `is_prime` checks if `p` is less than 2, in which case it is not prime.
If `p` is greater than or equal to 2, it checks if `p` is divisible by any integer `k` in the range `[2, min(int(math.sqrt(p)) + 1, p - 1)]`. If `p` is divisible by any of these integers, it is not prime.
If none of these conditions are met, `p` is prime.
The function `prime_fib` initializes a list `f` with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.
The function then enters an infinite loop that continues until `n` is equal to 0.
Inside the loop, the function appends the sum of the last two numbers in `f` to `f`.
If the last number in `f` is prime, the function subtracts 1 from `n`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the last number in `f`, which is the nth Fibonacci number.
For n = 1, the function will return 1, as 1 is the first Fibonacci number.
