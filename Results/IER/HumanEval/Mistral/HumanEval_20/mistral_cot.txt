 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of floats as input and returns a tuple of two floats.
It initializes two variables, closest_pair and distance, to None.
The function then enters a nested loop that iterates over all pairs of elements in the list.
For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference between the two elements and stores it in distance.
If distance is None, it means that the current pair is the closest pair found so far, and it stores the pair in closest_pair.
If distance is not None, it means that the current pair is closer than the closest pair found so far, and it updates the closest_pair and distance variables.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the closest_pair variable, which is a tuple of the two closest elements in the list.
<<<Output>>>
(1.0, 2.2)
