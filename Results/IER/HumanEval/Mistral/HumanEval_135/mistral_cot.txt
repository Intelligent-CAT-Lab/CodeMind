<<<Analysis>>>
The function `can_arrange` takes an array `arr` as input.
It initializes a variable `ind` to -1 and a variable `i` to 1.
The while loop runs until `i` is less than the length of the array.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`. If it is, it sets `ind` to `i`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of `ind`.
<<<Output>>>
-1
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
The return value of `can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5])` is -1 because the array is not sorted in ascending order.
