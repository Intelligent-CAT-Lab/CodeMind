 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_dict_case` takes a dictionary as input and returns a boolean value.
The function first checks if the dictionary is empty, if so it returns False.
Otherwise, it initializes a variable `state` to "start" and iterates over the keys of the dictionary.
For each key, it checks if it is a string, if not it sets the state to "mixed" and breaks out of the loop.
If the state is "start", it checks if the key is uppercase or lowercase, if not it sets the state to "mixed" and breaks out of the loop.
If the state is "upper" and the key is not uppercase or "lower" and the key is not lowercase, it sets the state to "mixed" and breaks out of the loop.
If the state is not "mixed" after the loop, it returns True.
<<<Output>>>
False
