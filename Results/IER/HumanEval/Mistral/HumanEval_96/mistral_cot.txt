 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_up_to` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of all prime numbers up to `n`.
The function first initializes an empty list `primes`.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive).
For each number `i` in this range, it sets a flag `is_prime` to `True`.
It then enters another loop that iterates from 2 to `i` (inclusive).
For each number `j` in this range, it checks if `i` is divisible by `j`. If it is, it sets `is_prime` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
After the inner loop finishes, if `is_prime` is still `True`, it means that `i` is a prime number and it is added to the list `primes`.
After the outer loop finishes, the function returns the list `primes`.
