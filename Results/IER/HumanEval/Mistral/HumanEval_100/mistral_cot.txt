<<<Analysis>>>
The function `make_a_pile` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of integers.
The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of integers. The list comprehension iterates over the range of integers from 0 to n-1 (inclusive) and for each integer `i`, it adds 2 to it and adds the result to the list.
The resulting list is returned by the function.
