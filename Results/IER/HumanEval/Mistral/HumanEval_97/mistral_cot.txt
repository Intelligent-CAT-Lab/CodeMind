 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `multiply` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`.
It calculates the remainder of `a` divided by 10 and the remainder of `b` divided by 10 using the modulo operator `%`.
It then multiplies the absolute value of the two remainders using the `abs` function.
The final result is returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `multiply(148, 412)` is 16.
