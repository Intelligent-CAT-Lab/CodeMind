 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `fib` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
The function first checks if `n` is equal to 0, in which case it returns 0.
If `n` is equal to 1, it returns 1.
Otherwise, it recursively calls the `fib` function with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments and adds the results together.
The recursion continues until `n` is 0 or 1, at which point the function returns the result.
