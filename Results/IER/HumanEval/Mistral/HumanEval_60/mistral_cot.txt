The function `sum_to_n` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all integers from 0 to `n`.
The function uses the built-in `sum` function, which takes an iterable as input and returns the sum of its elements.
In this case, the iterable is the range from 0 to `n + 1`, which includes `n` itself.
The `sum` function iterates over the range and adds up all the elements, returning the sum.
<<<Output>>>
0
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
Note that the function `sum_to_n` is called with `n=1`, so the sum of all integers from 0 to 2 (inclusive) is returned, which is 1.
