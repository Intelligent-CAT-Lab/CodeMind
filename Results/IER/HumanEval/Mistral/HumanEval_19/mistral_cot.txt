 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_numbers` takes a string as input and returns a string as output.
The function first defines a dictionary `value_map` that maps each digit from 0 to 9 to its corresponding integer value.
The function then uses list comprehension to split the input string into a list of individual words, and then filters out any words that are not numbers.
The function then uses the `sorted` function to sort the list of numbers in ascending order, using a lambda function as the key function. The lambda function takes each number as input and returns its corresponding integer value from the `value_map` dictionary.
Finally, the function uses the `join` method to join the sorted list of numbers back into a string, with spaces between each number.
For the input `'five zero four seven nine eight'`, the function first splits the string into a list of words `['five', 'zero', 'four', 'seven', 'nine', 'eight']`.
Then it filters out the non-numeric words `'zero'`, `'four'`, `'seven'`, `'nine'` and `'eight'`, leaving the list `['five']`.
Then it sorts the list in ascending order, resulting in `['five']`.
Finally, it joins the sorted list back into a string, resulting in the return value `'five'`.
<<<Output>>>
'five'
