 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `incr_list` takes a list as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1.
The function uses a list comprehension to achieve this. It iterates over each element e in the input list l and applies the expression (e + 1) to each element.
The resulting list is returned as output.
<<<Output>>>
[6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
