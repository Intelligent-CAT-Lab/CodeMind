 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_prime(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is prime or not.
The function first checks if `n` is less than 2, in which case it is not prime and the function returns `False`.
If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `n - 1`. For each value of `k` in this range, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `k`. If it is, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is not prime.
If the loop completes without finding any divisors of `n`, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.
