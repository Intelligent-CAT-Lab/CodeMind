 <<<Analysis>>>
The function valid_date takes a string as input, which represents a date in the format "month-day-year".
The function first removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string using the strip() method.
Then it splits the string into three parts using the split() method, which returns a list of substrings.
The function then converts the month, day and year substrings to integers using the int() method.
The function then checks if the month is within the range of 1 to 12.
If the month is 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12, it checks if the day is within the range of 1 to 31.
If the month is 4, 6, 9, or 11, it checks if the day is within the range of 1 to 30.
If the month is 2, it checks if the day is within the range of 1 to 29.
If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns False.
If all the conditions are met, the function returns True.
