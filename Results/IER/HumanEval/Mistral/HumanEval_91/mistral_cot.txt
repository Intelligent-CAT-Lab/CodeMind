<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_bored` takes a string `S` as input.
The first line of the function imports the `re` module, which is used to split the input string into sentences.
The `re.split` function splits the input string `S` into a list of sentences based on the regular expression `r'[.?!]\s*'`. This regular expression matches any character that is either a period, question mark, exclamation mark, or whitespace.
The resulting list of sentences is stored in the variable `sentences`.
The function then uses a list comprehension to check if the first two words of each sentence are "I ". The list comprehension returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition is met for each sentence.
The `sum` function is used to add up the boolean values returned by the list comprehension, giving the total number of sentences that meet the condition.
If the total number of sentences that meet the condition is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns `True`, indicating that the person is bored. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
