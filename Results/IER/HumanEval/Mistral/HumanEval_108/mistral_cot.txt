 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_nums` takes an array `arr` as input.
It first defines a helper function `digits_sum` that takes a number `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits.
The helper function first checks if `n` is negative, if so it negates it and changes the sign of the first digit.
Then it converts `n` to a list of integers by converting each digit to an integer.
The first element of the list is multiplied by -1 if `n` is negative.
Finally, the sum of the list is calculated using the built-in `sum` function.
The main function `count_nums` applies the `digits_sum` function to each element of the input array `arr` using a list comprehension.
It then filters out the negative numbers using the `filter` function and its lambda function.
Finally, it returns the length of the filtered list.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `count_nums([1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5])` is 4.
This is because the `digits_sum` function returns 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5 for the elements of the input array, and the `filter` function keeps only the positive numbers, which are 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The length of this filtered list is 4.
