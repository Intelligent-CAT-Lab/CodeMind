 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `numerical_letter_grade` takes a list of GPA values as input.
It initializes an empty list called `letter_grade` which will be used to store the corresponding letter grades.
The function then iterates through each GPA value in the input list.
For each GPA value, it checks if it meets the criteria for a specific letter grade.
If the GPA value is 4.0, it is considered an A+.
If the GPA value is greater than 3.7, it is considered an A.
If the GPA value is greater than 3.3, it is considered an A-.
If the GPA value is greater than 3.0, it is considered a B+.
If the GPA value is greater than 2.7, it is considered a B.
If the GPA value is greater than 2.3, it is considered a B-.
If the GPA value is greater than 2.0, it is considered a C+.
If the GPA value is greater than 1.7, it is considered a C.
If the GPA value is greater than 1.3, it is considered a C-.
If the GPA value is greater than 1.0, it is considered a D+.
If the GPA value is greater than 0.7, it is considered a D.
If the GPA value is greater than 0.0, it is considered a D-.
If the GPA value is less than or equal to 0.0, it is considered an E.
If the GPA value meets the criteria for a specific letter grade, it is added to the `letter_grade` list.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the `letter_grade` list.
