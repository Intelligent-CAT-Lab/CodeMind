 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `intersection` takes two tuples as input, representing two intervals. Each tuple contains two integers, representing the start and end of the interval.
The function first defines an inner function `is_prime` that takes an integer as input and returns True if it is prime, and False otherwise.
The function then calculates the length of the intersection of the two intervals by finding the maximum of their start values and the minimum of their end values.
If the length of the intersection is greater than 0 and is prime, the function returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".
In this case, the two intervals are (1, 2) and (2, 3), so the length of the intersection is 1. Since 1 is not prime, the function returns "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
