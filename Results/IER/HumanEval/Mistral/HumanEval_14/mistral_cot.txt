 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `all_prefixes` takes a string as input and returns a list of all its prefixes.
The function first initializes an empty list called `result`.
It then iterates over the range of the length of the input string using a for loop.
For each iteration, it appends the current substring of the input string to the result list.
The substring is created by slicing the input string starting from index i to i+1.
For example, when i=0, the substring is 'asdfgh'. When i=1, the substring is 'asdf'. When i=2, the substring is 'asdf'. When i=3, the substring is 'asdf'. When i=4, the substring is 'asdf'.
The final result is a list of all the prefixes of the input string.
<<<Output>>>
['', 'a', 'as', 'asd', 'asdf', 'asdfg']
