The function `concatenate` takes a list of strings as input and returns a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the list.
The function uses the `join` method of the string class to concatenate the strings in the list.
The input list `['x', 'y', 'z']` is passed to the function, and the function returns the concatenation of these strings, which is 'xyz'.
