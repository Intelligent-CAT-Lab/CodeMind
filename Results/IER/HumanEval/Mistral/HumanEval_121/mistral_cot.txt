 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `solution` takes a list `lst` as input.
It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list and select only the elements that meet the condition `idx%2==0 and x%2==1`.
This condition means that the element must be even (`idx%2==0`) and its value must be 1 (`x%2==1`).
The list comprehension returns a new list containing only the selected elements.
The `sum` function is then called on this new list, which returns the sum of all the elements in it.
The final return value of the function is the sum of the selected elements.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `solution([5, 8, 7, 1])` would be 0, because none of the elements in the list meet the condition `idx%2==0 and x%2==1`.
