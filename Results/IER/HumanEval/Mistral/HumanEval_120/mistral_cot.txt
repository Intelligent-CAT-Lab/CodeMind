 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `maximum` takes two arguments: `arr` and `k`. `arr` is a list of integers and `k` is an integer.
The function first checks if `k` is equal to 0. If it is, it returns an empty list.
If `k` is not equal to 0, the function sorts the list `arr` in ascending order.
Then it selects the last `k` elements of the sorted list and returns them.
In this case, the input is `arr = [-3, -4, 5]` and `k = 3`.
The sorted list is `[-4, -3, 5]`.
The last 3 elements of the sorted list are `[-3, -4, 5]`.
Therefore, the return value of the function is `[-3, -4, 5]`.
<<<Output>>>
[-3, -4, 5]
