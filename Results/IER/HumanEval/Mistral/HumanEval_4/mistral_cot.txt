 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of floats as input and returns the mean absolute deviation of the numbers in the list.
The first line calculates the mean of the numbers by summing them up and dividing by the length of the list.
The second line calculates the mean absolute deviation by summing the absolute differences between each number and the mean, and dividing by the length of the list.
The function returns the final result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])` is 1.5811388300841898.
