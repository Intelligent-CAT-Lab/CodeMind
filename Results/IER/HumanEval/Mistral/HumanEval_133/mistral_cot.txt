 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_squares` takes a list `lst` as input.
It initializes a variable `squared` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of squares of numbers in the list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in the list `lst`.
For each element, it calculates its square using the `math.ceil()` function to round up the number to the nearest integer, and then adds it to the variable `squared`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `squared`, which is the sum of squares of all elements in the list.
