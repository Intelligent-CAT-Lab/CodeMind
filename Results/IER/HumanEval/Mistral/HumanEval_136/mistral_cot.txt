 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `largest_smallest_integers` takes a list of integers as input.
It first filters the list to create two new lists: one containing only the negative integers and the other containing only the positive integers.
The function then returns a tuple containing the maximum value from the list of negative integers and the minimum value from the list of positive integers.
If the list of negative integers is empty, it returns None for the smallest value.
If the list of positive integers is empty, it returns None for the largest value.
