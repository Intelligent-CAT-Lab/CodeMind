 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `smallest_change` takes an array `arr` as input.
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of changes required.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the array `arr` divided by 2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider pairs of adjacent elements in the array.
For each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if they are equal. If they are not, it increments the variable `ans` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
