 <<<Analysis>>>
The function intersperse takes two arguments: a list of integers called "numbers" and an integer called "delimeter".
The function first checks if the list is empty, if it is, it returns an empty list.
Otherwise, it initializes an empty list called "result" that will be used to store the final list with the delimiter inserted.
The code then iterates over the list of numbers, for each number n in the list, it appends n to the result list, then appends the delimiter, and finally appends the next number in the list (if any).
After the loop finishes, the code appends the last number in the list (if any) to the result list.
Finally, the code returns the result list.
