 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `compare` takes two arguments: `game` and `guess`.
`game` is a list of integers, and `guess` is a list of integers.
The function returns a list of absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `game` and `guess`.
The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the corresponding elements of `game` and `guess` simultaneously.
For each pair of elements, it calculates the absolute difference using the `abs` function and appends it to the result list.
The final result list is returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
[3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2]
