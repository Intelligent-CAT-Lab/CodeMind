 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `string_xor` takes two string inputs `a` and `b`, and returns a string.
The function first defines an inner function `xor` that takes two integer inputs `i` and `j`, and returns either '0' or '1' depending on whether they are equal or not.
The outer function then uses a generator expression to iterate over the characters in `a` and `b` in parallel, and applies the `xor` function to each pair of characters. The result of each `xor` operation is then concatenated into a single string using the `join` method.
The final result is the string obtained by performing an XOR operation on each pair of characters in `a` and `b`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `string_xor('111000', '101010')` is '101101'.
