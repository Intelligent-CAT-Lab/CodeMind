 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `right_angle_triangle` takes three arguments, a, b and c, which represent the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle.
The function returns `True` if the triangle is a right-angled triangle, and `False` otherwise.
The function checks if any of the following conditions are met:
* a^2 == b^2 + c^2
* b^2 == a^2 + c^2
* c^2 == a^2 + b^2
If any of these conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that the triangle is a right-angled triangle.
If none of these conditions are met, the function returns `False`, indicating that the triangle is not a right-angled triangle.
<<<Output>>>
