 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_element` takes a list as input and returns the maximum element in the list.
The variable `m` is initialized to the first element of the list, which is 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list, comparing each element `e` with the current maximum value `m`.
If `e` is greater than `m`, it updates the value of `m` to `e`.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `m`, which is 3.
