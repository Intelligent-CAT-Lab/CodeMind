 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `fix_spaces` takes a string as input and returns a new string with spaces fixed.
The function initializes a new string `new_text` and a variable `i` to 0.
It also initializes two variables `start` and `end` to 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the input string `text`.
For each character `text[i]`, it checks if it is a space. If it is, it increments the `end` variable.
If it is not a space, it checks if the difference between `end` and `start` is greater than 2. If it is, it adds a hyphen before the character.
If the difference between `end` and `start` is greater than 0, it adds an underscore before the character.
If the difference between `end` and `start` is 0, it simply adds the character to the new string.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the difference between `end` and `start` is greater than 2. If it is, it adds a hyphen before the last character.
If the difference between `end` and `start` is greater than 0, it adds an underscore before the last character.
Finally, the function returns the new string `new_text`.
