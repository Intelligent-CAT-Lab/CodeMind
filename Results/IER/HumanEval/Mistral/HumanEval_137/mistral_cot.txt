 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `compare_one` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`.
The function first checks if both arguments are strings, and if so, it replaces all commas with periods using the `replace()` method.
Then it checks if the two numbers are equal by converting them to float and comparing them using the `==` operator.
If the two numbers are equal, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it compares the two numbers and returns the larger one.
In this case, `a` is 1 and `b` is 2, so the function first converts both to float, which gives 1.0 and 2.0, respectively. Since 1.0 is less than 2.0, the function returns `b`, which is 2.
