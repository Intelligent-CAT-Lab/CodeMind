<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: string and substring.
The variable times is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the substring appears in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the string minus the length of the substring plus 1.
For each iteration, it checks if the substring appears in the string starting from the current index i. If it does, it increments the variable times by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of times, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
