 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_max_triples` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of triples of integers from 1 to n that have a sum that is divisible by 3.
The function first creates a list `A` of integers from 1 to n using a list comprehension.
Then it initializes an empty list `ans` to store the triples that meet the condition.
The function then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible combinations of three integers from 1 to n.
For each combination, it checks if the sum of the three integers is divisible by 3 using the modulo operator (%).
If it is, it adds the tuple of the three integers to the `ans` list.
After the loops finish, the code prints the length of the `ans` list, which is the number of triples that meet the condition.
