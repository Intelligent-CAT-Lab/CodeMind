 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `words_in_sentence` takes a string as input and returns a string.
The function first initializes an empty list `new_lst` which will be used to store the words that meet the condition.
The function then iterates over each word in the sentence using the `split()` method, which splits the sentence into a list of words based on spaces.
For each word, the function checks if its length is 1, in which case it is added to the list.
If the length of the word is not 1, the function checks if it is divisible by any number between 2 and its length minus 1 (inclusive). If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is added to the list.
After the loop finishes, the function joins the elements of the `new_lst` list with spaces using the `join()` method and returns the resulting string.
