 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `correct_bracketing` takes a string `brackets` as input.
It initializes a variable `depth` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current depth of the brackets.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character `b` in the `brackets` string.
If `b` is `"("`, the depth is incremented by 1.
If `b` is `")"`, the depth is decremented by 1.
If the depth becomes negative at any point, the function returns `False`, indicating that the brackets are not correctly bracketed.
After the loop finishes, the function returns `True` if the depth is 0, indicating that the brackets are correctly bracketed.
