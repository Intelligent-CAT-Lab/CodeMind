 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `fib4` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
The function initializes a list `results` with the first four Fibonacci numbers: 0, 0, 2, 0.
The function then checks if `n` is less than 4. If it is, it returns the corresponding Fibonacci number from the `results` list.
If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the function enters a loop that iterates from 4 to `n`. For each iteration, it appends the sum of the last four Fibonacci numbers to the `results` list and removes the first element of the list.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the last element of the `results` list, which is the nth Fibonacci number.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `fib4(5)` is 5.
