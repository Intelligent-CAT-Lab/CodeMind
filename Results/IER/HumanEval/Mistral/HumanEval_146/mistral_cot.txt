 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `specialFilter` takes a list of integers as input. It initializes a variable `count` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of integers that meet the condition.
The function then iterates through each integer in the input list `nums`.
For each integer, it checks if it is greater than 10. If it is, it checks if the first and last digits of the integer are both odd. If they are, it increments the count variable.
The condition is met for the integer 1, since the first digit is 1 and the last digit is 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of count, which is 1.
