<<<Analysis>>>
The function `solve` takes an integer `N` as input and returns the binary representation of the sum of its digits.
The function first converts the integer `N` to a string using the built-in `str()` function.
Then it uses a generator expression to convert each digit of the string to an integer using the built-in `int()` function and sum them up using the built-in `sum()` function.
The resulting sum is then converted to binary using the built-in `bin()` function.
Finally, the binary representation is returned by slicing the string from the second index to the end using the slice notation `[2:]`.
