<<<Analysis>>>
The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string.
The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of strings from 0 to n.
The list comprehension converts each integer in the range to a string and appends it to the list.
The `join` method is then used to join the elements of the list with a space as the separator, resulting in a single string.
The function returns this string.
<<<Output>>>
'0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9'
