 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `max_fill` takes two arguments: `grid` and `capacity`. `grid` is a list of lists representing a 2D grid, and `capacity` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements that can be filled in each row of the grid.
The function returns the sum of the number of elements that can be filled in each row of the grid, divided by the capacity.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each row of the grid and calculate the number of elements that can be filled in it by dividing the sum of the elements in the row by the capacity. The `math.ceil` function is used to round up the result to the nearest integer.
The function then returns the sum of the number of elements that can be filled in each row of the grid.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1)` is 3.
This is because the number of elements that can be filled in each row of the grid is:
- [0,0,1,0] -> 2
- [0,1,0,0] -> 2
- [1,1,1,1] -> 3
The sum of these values is 2 + 2 + 3 = 7, divided by 1 which gives 7.
