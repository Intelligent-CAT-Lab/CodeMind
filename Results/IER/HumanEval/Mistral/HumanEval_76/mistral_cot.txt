<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_simple_power` takes two arguments, `x` and `n`.
The function first checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, it returns `True` if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise it returns `False`.
If `n` is not equal to 1, the function initializes a variable `power` to 1 and enters a loop that multiplies `power` by `n` until `power` is greater than or equal to `x`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns `True` if `power` is equal to `x`, otherwise it returns `False`.
In this case, `x` is 16 and `n` is 2.
The function first checks if `n` is equal to 1, which it is not.
The function then initializes `power` to 1 and enters the loop.
The loop multiplies `power` by `n` until `power` is greater than or equal to `x`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns `True` because `power` is equal to `x`.
