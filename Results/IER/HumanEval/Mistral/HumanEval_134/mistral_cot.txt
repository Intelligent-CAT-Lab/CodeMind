 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a string `txt` as input.
It first splits the string by spaces, which returns a list of words.
It then selects the last word in the list using the index `-1`.
It then checks if the length of the last word is 1 and if the ASCII value of the first letter of the word is between 97 and 122.
If both conditions are met, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
<<<Output>>>
True
