<<<Analysis>>>
The function `anti_shuffle` takes a string `s` as input.
The function first splits the string `s` into a list of words using the `split` method.
Then, it applies the `sorted` function to each word in the list, which returns a sorted list of characters.
The `join` method is then used to join the sorted characters of each word back into a string.
Finally, the `join` method is used again to join all the sorted strings back into a single string, separated by spaces.
The resulting string is returned by the function.
<<<Output>>>
'Hi'
