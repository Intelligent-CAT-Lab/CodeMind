 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `double_the_difference` takes a list `lst` as input.
It uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains the squares of all elements in `lst` that meet the following conditions:
- The element is greater than 0
- The element is odd (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is not 0)
- The element does not contain a decimal point (i.e., it is an integer)
The resulting list is then passed to the `sum` function, which returns the sum of all elements in the list.
Finally, the sum is returned as the output of the function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `double_the_difference([0.2, 3, 5])` is 10.
The list comprehension will create a new list that contains the squares of 3 and 5, which are 9 and 25, respectively. The sum of these two numbers is 34, which is then returned by the function.
