 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_duplicates` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list of integers that contains only the unique elements of the input list.
The function uses the `collections.Counter` class to count the occurrences of each element in the input list.
It then iterates over the input list and returns only the elements that have a count of 1, which means they are unique.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
