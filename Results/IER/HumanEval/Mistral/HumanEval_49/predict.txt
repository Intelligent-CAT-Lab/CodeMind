The return value of `modp(3, 5)` is 4.

The function calculates the remainder of 3 divided by 5, which is 3. Then it multiplies 3 by 2 and takes the remainder when dividing by 5, which is 3 again. Finally, it multiplies 3 by 2 and takes the remainder when dividing by 5, which is 1. The final value of `ret` is 1, which is returned as the output.
