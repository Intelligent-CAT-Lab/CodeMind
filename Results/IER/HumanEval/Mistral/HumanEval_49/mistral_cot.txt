 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `modp` takes two integer arguments, n and p.
It initializes a variable `ret` to 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates n times.
In each iteration, it multiplies `ret` by 2 and takes the remainder when dividing by p.
The final value of `ret` is returned as the output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `modp(3, 5)` is 4.

The function calculates the remainder of 3 divided by 5, which is 3. Then it multiplies 3 by 2 and takes the remainder when dividing by 5, which is 3 again. Finally, it multiplies 3 by 2 and takes the remainder when dividing by 5, which is 1. The final value of `ret` is 1, which is returned as the output.
