 <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list as input and returns the median of the list.
The first step is to sort the list in ascending order.
The next step is to check if the length of the list is odd or even.
If the length is odd, the median is the middle element of the sorted list. In this case, the length of the list is 5, so the median is the third element, which is 3.
If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. In this case, the length of the list is 5, so the median is the average of the third and fourth elements, which are 3 and 4, respectively.
The average is calculated by adding the two middle elements and dividing by 2.
<<<Output>>>
