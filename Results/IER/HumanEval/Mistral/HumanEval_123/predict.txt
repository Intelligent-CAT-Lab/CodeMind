The function `get_odd_collatz` takes an integer `n` as input.
The function first checks if `n` is even. If it is, it initializes an empty list `odd_collatz`. If it is odd, it initializes a list `odd_collatz` with the value of `n`.
The function then enters a while loop that continues until `n` is less than or equal to 1.
Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is even. If it is, it divides `n` by 2 and appends the result to the list `odd_collatz`. If it is odd, it multiplies `n` by 3 and adds 1, then appends the result to the list `odd_collatz`.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the sorted list `odd_collatz`.
For the input `n = 14`, the function first checks that it is odd, so it initializes the list `odd_collatz` with the value of `14`.
The function then enters the loop and checks that `14` is odd, so it appends `14` to the list `odd_collatz`.
The function then divides `14` by 2, which gives `7`, and appends `7` to the list `odd_collatz`.
The function then multiplies `7` by 3 and adds 1, which gives `12`, and appends `12` to the list `odd_collatz`.
The function then divides `12` by 2, which gives `6`, and appends `6` to the list `odd_collatz`.
The function then multiplies `6` by 3 and adds 1, which gives `18`, and appends `18` to the list `odd_collatz`.
The function then divides `18` by 2, which gives `9`, and appends `9` to the list `odd_collatz`.
The function then multiplies `9` by 3 and adds 1, which gives `27`, and appends `27` to the list `odd_collatz`.
The function then divides `27` by 2, which gives `13`, and appends `13`
