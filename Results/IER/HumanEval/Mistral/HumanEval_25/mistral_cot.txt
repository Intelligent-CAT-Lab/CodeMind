 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `factorize` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of integers representing the prime factors of `n`.
The function first imports the `math` module to use the `sqrt` function.
It initializes an empty list `fact` to store the prime factors.
It initializes a variable `i` to 2, which will be used to check for prime factors.
The function enters a while loop that iterates until `i` is greater than the square root of `n` plus 1.
Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator `%`. If it is, it appends `i` to the `fact` list and divides `n` by `i` using integer division `//`.
After the loop finishes, the function checks if `n` is greater than 1. If it is, it appends `n` to the `fact` list.
Finally, the function returns the `fact` list.
