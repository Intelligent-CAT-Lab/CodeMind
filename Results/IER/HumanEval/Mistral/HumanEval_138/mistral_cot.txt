<<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` takes an integer `n` as input.
The function returns `True` if `n` is even and greater than or equal to 8, otherwise it returns `False`.
The function first checks if `n` is even by using the modulo operator `%` with 2. If the remainder is 0, then `n` is even.
Then it checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 8 by using the comparison operator `>=`.
If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
<<<Output>>>
False
