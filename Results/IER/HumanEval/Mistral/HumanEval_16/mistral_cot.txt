 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `count_distinct_characters` takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
The string is first converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method.
Then, the set() function is used to remove any duplicate characters from the string.
The length of the resulting set is then returned using the `len()` function.
The input string is 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE'.
After converting it to lowercase, we get 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'cade'.
The set() function removes the duplicate characters from this string, resulting in {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}.
The length of this set is 5, which is the number of distinct characters in the input string.
<<<Output>>>
5
