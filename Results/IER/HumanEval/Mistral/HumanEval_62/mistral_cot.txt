 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `derivative` takes a list `xs` as input.
It uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the product of the current index `i` and the current element `x` of the input list `xs`.
The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and the element of the input list `xs` at the same time.
The resulting list is then sliced to remove the first element (which is the index) and only keep the second element (which is the product of index and element).
The resulting list is returned as the output of the function.
