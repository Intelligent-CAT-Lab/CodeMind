 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `unique` takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements of the input list.
The function first converts the input list to a set using the built-in set function. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements.
Then it converts the set back to a list using the built-in list function.
Finally, it sorts the list in ascending order using the built-in sorted function.
The function returns the sorted list of unique elements.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
