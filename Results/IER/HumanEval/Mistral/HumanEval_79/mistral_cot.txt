<<<Analysis>>>
The function `decimal_to_binary` takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation.
The function first converts the decimal number to binary using the built-in `bin()` function. The `bin()` function returns a string representation of the binary number, which starts with "0b".
The function then removes the first two characters of the string using slicing (`[2:]`). This is because the first two characters are "0b", which we don't want in the final result.
Finally, the function adds "db" to the beginning and end of the binary string to ensure that the final result is a string.
<<<Output>>>
"db0b1010db"
