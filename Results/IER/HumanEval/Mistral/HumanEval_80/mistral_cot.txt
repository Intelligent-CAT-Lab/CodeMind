 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_happy` takes a string `s` as input.
The function first checks if the length of the string is less than 3, if so it returns False.
If the length is 3 or greater, it enters a loop that iterates from the second to the last character of the string (inclusive).
For each character, it checks if it is equal to the next character or the one after the next character. If it is, it returns False.
If the loop completes without returning False, it means the string is happy and it returns True.
<<<Output>>>
False
