 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `prod_signs` takes an array `arr` as input.
The first check is if the array is empty, in which case the function returns `None`.
If the array is not empty, the function initializes `prod` to 0. If there is a negative number in the array, it increments `prod` by 2 to the power of the number of negative numbers in the array.
The function then calculates the absolute value of each number in the array and sums them up using a list comprehension.
Finally, the function returns `prod * sum`.
For the input `[1, 2, 2, -4]`, the function first checks that the array is not empty, so it proceeds to the next step.
The function calculates the number of negative numbers in the array, which is 1.
The function then calculates `prod` as 2 to the power of 1, which is 2.
The function then calculates the sum of the absolute values of the numbers in the array, which is 5.
Finally, the function returns `2 * 5`, which is 10.
