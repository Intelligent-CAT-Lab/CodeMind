 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `exchange` takes two lists as input, `lst1` and `lst2`. It initializes two variables, `odd` and `even`, to 0.
It then iterates through each element in `lst1` and checks if it is odd by using the modulo operator (%). If it is odd, it increments the `odd` variable.
It then iterates through each element in `lst2` and checks if it is even by using the modulo operator (%). If it is even, it increments the `even` variable.
The function then compares the `even` and `odd` variables. If `even` is greater than or equal to `odd`, it returns "YES", otherwise it returns "NO".
In this case, both lists are the same, so the function will compare the number of odd and even elements in the list and return "NO" because there are an equal number of odd and even elements.
<<<Output>>>
NO
