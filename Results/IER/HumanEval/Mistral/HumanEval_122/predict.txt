The return value of `add_elements([1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99], 3)` is 10.
The first three elements of the list are 1, -2 and -3, which have string representations of length 1, 2 and 2 respectively. The next three elements are 41, 57 and 76, which have string representations of length 2. The last three elements are 87, 88 and 99, which have string representations of length 2. The sum of these elements is 1 + 2 + 2 + 41 + 57 + 76 + 87 + 88 + 99 = 300. Since k is 3, the function returns the sum of the first three elements, which is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
