 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_row` takes two arguments: a list `lst` and an integer `x`.
It first creates a list of tuples `coords` that contains all the coordinates of the integer `x` in the list `lst`. It does this by iterating over each element in the list `lst` and then iterating over each element in that element. If the current element is equal to `x`, it adds a tuple containing the current index `i` and the current index `j` to the `coords` list.
The function then sorts the `coords` list first by the second element of each tuple (i.e. the column index) in descending order, and then by the first element of each tuple (i.e. the row index) in ascending order.
Finally, the function returns the sorted `coords` list.
If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list.
