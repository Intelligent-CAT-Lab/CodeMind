 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `is_sorted` takes a list as input and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and all digits in the list appear only once.
The function first initializes a dictionary called `count_digit` with all elements of the list as keys and a value of 0 for each key.
It then iterates through the list and increments the corresponding value in the dictionary for each element.
The function then checks if any value in the dictionary is greater than 2, which would indicate that a digit appears more than once in the list. If any such value is found, the function returns `False`.
If no such value is found, the function checks if the list is sorted in ascending order by comparing each element with its previous element. If the list is sorted, the function returns `True`.
If the list is not sorted, the function returns `False`.
For the input `[5]`, the function first initializes the dictionary `count_digit` with a key of 5 and a value of 0.
Since 5 is the only element in the list, the function does not check if any value in the dictionary is greater than 2.
The function then checks if the list is sorted in ascending order. Since 5 is the only element in the list, it is greater than its previous element, so the function returns `False`.
