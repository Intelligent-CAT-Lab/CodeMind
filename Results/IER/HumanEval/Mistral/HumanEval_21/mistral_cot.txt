 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of floats as input and returns a list of floats.
The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the built-in `min` and `max` functions.
Then it applies a transformation to each element in the input list by subtracting the minimum value and dividing the result by the range between the minimum and maximum values.
The resulting list contains the transformed values.
<<<Output>>>
[0.0, 1.0]
