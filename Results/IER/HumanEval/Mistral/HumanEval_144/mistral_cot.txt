 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `simplify` takes two arguments, `x` and `n`, which are strings in the form of "a/b" and "c/d", respectively.
The function first splits each string by the "/" character, which gives us two tuples: `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`.
It then calculates the numerator and denominator by multiplying the first elements of each tuple.
The function then checks if the numerator divided by the denominator is an integer. If it is, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
In this case, `x` is "1/5" and `n` is "5/1".
After splitting the strings, we get `(1, 5)` and `(5, 1)`.
The numerator is calculated as 1*5 = 5 and the denominator is calculated as 5*1 = 5.
Since 5 divided by 5 is an integer, the function returns `True`.
<<<Output>>>
True
