 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_array` takes an array `arr` as input.
The function first calls the built-in `sorted` function on the array `arr`.
The `sorted` function returns a new sorted array.
The function then calls the `sorted` function again on the new sorted array.
The `sorted` function returns a new sorted array.
The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is set to a lambda function.
The lambda function takes an element `x` from the array and returns the number of 1's in the binary representation of `x` using the `bin` function.
The `count` method is used to count the number of occurrences of the substring '1' in the binary representation of `x`.
The `count` method returns the number of occurrences of the substring '1' in the binary representation of `x`.
The `sorted` function sorts the array based on the returned value of the lambda function.
The lambda function returns the number of 1's in the binary representation of `x`, which is used to sort the array.
The final sorted array is returned by the function.
