<<<Analysis>>>
The function `pairs_sum_to_zero` takes a list `l` as input.
It initializes a variable `result` to `False`.
It then enters a loop that iterates over each element `l1` in the list `l`.
For each `l1`, it enters another loop that iterates over the remaining elements `l[j]` in the list `l` starting from `i+1`.
It checks if the sum of `l1` and `l[j]` is equal to 0. If it is, it sets `result` to `True` and breaks out of the inner loop.
After the inner loop finishes, it checks if `result` is `True`. If it is, it means that there is a pair of elements in the list that sum up to 0, so it returns `True`. If it is not, it means that there is no such pair, so it returns `False`.
