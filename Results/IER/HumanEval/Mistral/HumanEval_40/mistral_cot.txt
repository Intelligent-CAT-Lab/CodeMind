<<<Analysis>>>
The function `triples_sum_to_zero` takes a list `l` as input.
It uses three nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of three elements from the list.
For each combination, it checks if the sum of the three elements is equal to 0.
If it is, it returns True, indicating that there is a triplet that sums to 0.
If no such triplet is found after iterating over all combinations, it returns False.
In this case, the input list is `[1, 3, 5, 0]`.
The first loop iterates over the first element of the list, which is 1.
The second loop iterates over the second element of the list, which is 3.
The third loop iterates over the third element of the list, which is 5.
Since the sum of 1, 3 and 5 is 9, which is not equal to 0, the function returns False.
