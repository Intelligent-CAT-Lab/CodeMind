 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `total_match` takes two lists as input, `lst1` and `lst2`.
It initializes two variables `l1` and `l2` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total length of the strings in each list.
The code then enters two loops that iterate over each string in `lst1` and `lst2`, respectively.
For each string, it calculates its length and adds it to the corresponding variable `l1` or `l2`.
After both loops finish, the code compares the lengths of the two lists. If `l1` is less than or equal to `l2`, it means that the strings in `lst1` have a total length that is less than or equal to the total length of the strings in `lst2`, so the function returns `lst1`. Otherwise, it means that the strings in `lst2` have a total length that is greater than the total length of the strings in `lst1`, so the function returns `lst2`.
In this case, the total length of the strings in `lst1` is 10 (2+3+5), and the total length of the strings in `lst2` is 10 (2+2), so the condition is not met and the function returns `lst2`.
