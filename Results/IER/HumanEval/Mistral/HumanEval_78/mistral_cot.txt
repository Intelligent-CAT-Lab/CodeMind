<<<Analysis>>>
The function `hex_key` takes a string as input and returns the number of prime digits in the string.
The function first initializes a list of prime digits `primes` as ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D').
It then initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of prime digits found in the input string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string `num`.
For each character, it checks if it is in the list of prime digits `primes`. If it is, it increments the `total` variable.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `total`, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
