 <<<Analysis>>>
The function minSubArraySum takes a list of integers as input.
The variable max_sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the maximum sum of a subarray.
The variable s is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current sum of the subarray.
The code then iterates through the list of integers, adding each integer to s.
If s becomes negative, it is set to 0, which means that the current subarray has a negative sum and cannot contribute to the minimum subarray sum.
The code then updates max_sum to be the maximum of s and max_sum.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if max_sum is 0. If it is, it means that the minimum subarray sum is the absolute value of the maximum sum, which is -max_sum.
Finally, the code returns the minimum subarray sum.
