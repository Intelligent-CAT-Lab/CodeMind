 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_by_substring` takes two arguments: `strings` and `substring`. `strings` is a list of strings, and `substring` is a string that we want to filter the list by.
The function uses a list comprehension to filter the list by the substring. It returns a new list containing only the strings that contain the substring.
In this case, the input list is empty, so the function will return an empty list.
