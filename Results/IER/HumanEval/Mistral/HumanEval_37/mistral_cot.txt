 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sort_even` takes a list as input and returns a list.
The function first creates two lists, evens and odds, by slicing the input list l. evens contains all the even numbers in the list, and odds contains all the odd numbers in the list.
Then it sorts the evens list in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
The function then creates an empty list ans, which will be used to store the sorted list of even and odd numbers.
It uses a for loop to iterate over the evens and odds lists, and for each pair of elements, it appends both elements to the ans list using the `extend()` method.
Finally, if the length of the evens list is greater than the length of the odds list, it appends the last element of the evens list to the ans list.
The function then returns the ans list.
