 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `add` takes a list as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.
The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the even numbers in the input list. It does this by iterating over the input list using the `range` function with a step of 2 (i.e. every other element), and checking if the current element is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the current element is even, it is added to the new list.
The function then uses the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of the elements in the new list.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `add([4, 88])` would be 28.
