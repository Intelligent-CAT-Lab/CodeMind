 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `pluck` takes an array as input and returns a list.
The function first checks if the length of the array is 0, if so it returns an empty list.
Otherwise, it uses the built-in filter function to create a new list containing only the even numbers from the input array.
If the resulting list is empty, it returns an empty list.
Otherwise, it returns a list containing the minimum even number and its index in the original array.
In this case, the input array is [4, 2, 3], which has no even numbers. Therefore, the function returns an empty list.
<<<Output>>>
[]
