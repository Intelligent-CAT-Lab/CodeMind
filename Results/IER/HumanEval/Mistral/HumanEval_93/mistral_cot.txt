 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `encode` takes a string as input and performs the following steps:

1. It defines a dictionary `vowels_replace` that replaces each vowel in the string with its corresponding ASCII value plus 2.
2. It converts the input string to uppercase using the `swapcase()` method.
3. It iterates over each character in the string and replaces vowels with their corresponding ASCII value plus 2 using the `vowels_replace` dictionary. If the character is not a vowel, it remains unchanged.
4. It joins the resulting characters into a string using the `join()` method.

For the input `'TEST'`, the function first converts it to uppercase, resulting in `'TEST'`. Then it replaces the vowels with their corresponding ASCII value plus 2:

* 'T' becomes 'W' (ord('T') + 2 = 83)
* 'E' becomes 'I' (ord('E') + 2 = 85)
* 'S' becomes 'U' (ord('S') + 2 = 87)
* 'T' becomes 'W' (ord('T') + 2 = 83)

So the resulting string is `'WITSUW'`.

'WITSUW'
