 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `filter_integers` takes a list of values as input and returns a new list containing only the integers from the original list.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the values in the input list and checks if each value is an integer using the `isinstance()` function. If the value is an integer, it is added to the new list.
The input list `[3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b']` contains both integers and non-integers. The function will filter out the non-integers and return a new list containing only the integers, which are [3, 3, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[3, 3, 3]
