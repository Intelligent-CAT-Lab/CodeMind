 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `choose_num` takes two arguments, `x` and `y`.
The first `if` statement checks if `x` is greater than `y`. If it is, the function returns -1.
The second `if` statement checks if `y` is even. If it is, the function returns `y`.
The third `if` statement checks if `x` is equal to `y`. If it is, the function returns -1.
If none of these conditions are met, the function returns `y - 1`.
In this case, `x` is 12 and `y` is 15.
Since `x` is not greater than `y`, the first `if` statement is not met.
Since `y` is not even, the second `if` statement is not met.
Since `x` is not equal to `y`, the third `if` statement is not met.
Therefore, the function returns `y - 1`, which is 15 - 1 = 14.
