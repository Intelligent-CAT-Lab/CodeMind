<<<Analysis>>>
The function `truncate_number` takes a float as input and returns a float.
The function uses the modulo operator `%` to truncate the decimal part of the input number.
The modulo operator returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
In this case, the left operand is the input number and the right operand is 1.0.
So, the function returns the integer part of the input number.
<<<Output>>>
0.0
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
The return value of the function `truncate_number(3.5)` is 0.0, as the integer part of 3.5 is 3.
