The function `is_palindrome` takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not.
The function first checks if the input string is empty, and if so, it returns an empty string.
It then initializes a variable `beginning_of_suffix` to 0.
The function enters a loop that continues until the string is a palindrome.
Inside the loop, it checks if the substring of the string starting from `beginning_of_suffix` is a palindrome. If it is not, it increments `beginning_of_suffix`.
After the loop finishes, the function concatenates the original string with the reversed substring of the string starting from `beginning_of_suffix` and returns the result.
For the input string 'jerry', the function first checks if it is empty, which it is not.
It then initializes `beginning_of_suffix` to 0.
The function enters the loop and checks if the substring starting from `beginning_of_suffix` is a palindrome. Since the substring starting from 0 is 'jerry', which is not a palindrome, it increments `beginning_of_suffix` to 1.
The function then checks if the substring starting from `beginning_of_suffix` is a palindrome. Since the substring starting from 1 is 'erry', which is not a palindrome, it increments `beginning_of_suffix` to 2.
The function then checks if the substring starting from `beginning_of_suffix` is a palindrome. Since the substring starting from 2 is 'ry', which is not a palindrome, it increments `beginning_of_suffix` to 3.
The function then checks if the substring starting from `beginning_of_suffix` is a palindrome. Since the substring starting from 3 is 'ry', which is not a palindrome, it increments `beginning_of_suffix` to 4.
The function then checks if the substring starting from `beginning_of_suffix` is a palindrome. Since the substring starting from 4
