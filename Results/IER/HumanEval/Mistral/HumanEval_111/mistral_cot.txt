 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `histogram` takes a string as input and returns a dictionary.
The first line initializes an empty dictionary called `dict1`.
The second line splits the input string into a list of individual words using the `split()` method.
The third line initializes a variable `t` to 0.
The fourth line enters a loop that iterates over each word in the list.
For each word, it checks if the word appears more than once in the list. If it does, it updates the value of `t` to be the number of times the word appears.
The fifth line checks if `t` is greater than 0. If it is, it enters another loop that iterates over each word in the list.
For each word, it checks if the word appears exactly `t` times in the list. If it does, it adds the word as a key in the `dict1` dictionary with the value of `t`.
Finally, the function returns the `dict1` dictionary.
For the input `'a b b a'`, the output will be a dictionary with the following keys and values:
{
'a': 2,
'b': 2
}
<<<Output>>>
{
'a': 2,
'b': 2
}
