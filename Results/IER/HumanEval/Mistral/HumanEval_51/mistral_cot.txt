 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `remove_vowels` takes a string as input and returns a new string with all vowels removed.
The function first converts the input string to lowercase using the `lower()` method.
Then it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string and checks if it is a vowel using the `in` keyword. If it is not a vowel, it is included in the new string.
The resulting string is then returned using the `join()` method.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `remove_vowels('fedcba')` is "fdcb".
