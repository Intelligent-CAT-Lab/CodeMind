<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string s as input and returns the sum of the digits of all the characters in the string.
The function first checks if the string is empty, if so it returns 0.
Otherwise, it uses a generator expression to iterate over each character in the string.
For each character, it checks if it is uppercase using the isupper() method. If it is, it converts the character to its ASCII value using the ord() function and adds it to the sum. If it is not uppercase, it returns 0.
The sum is then returned as the final result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `digitSum("You arE Very Smart")` is 27.
