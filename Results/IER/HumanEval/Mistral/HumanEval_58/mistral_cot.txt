 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `common` takes two lists as input, `l1` and `l2`. It initializes an empty set `ret` to store the common elements.
It then enters two nested loops that iterate over each element in `l1` and `l2`. For each pair of elements, it checks if they are equal. If they are, it adds the element to the set `ret`.
After the loops finish, the code converts the set `ret` to a list and sorts it in ascending order.
The final return value is the sorted list of common elements.
