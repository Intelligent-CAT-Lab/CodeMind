 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `sum_squares` takes a list `lst` as input.
It initializes an empty list `result` to store the squares of the elements that meet the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the list `lst`.
For each element `lst[i]`, it checks if `i` is divisible by 3, 4 or both.
If `i` is divisible by 3, it appends the square of `lst[i]` to the `result` list.
If `i` is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 3, it appends the cube of `lst[i]` to the `result` list.
If `i` is not divisible by 3 or 4, it appends the original value of `lst[i]` to the `result` list.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `result`, which is a list of squares and cubes of the elements that meet the condition.
The condition is met when `i` is 3, which is the only element that is divisible by 3 but not divisible by 4.
Therefore, the final value of `result` is [9].
