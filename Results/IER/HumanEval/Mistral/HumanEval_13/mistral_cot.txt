 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `greatest_common_divisor` takes two integer arguments `a` and `b`.
It uses a while loop to repeatedly replace `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` becomes 0.
At this point, `a` will be the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
The function returns `a`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `greatest_common_divisor(3, 7)` is 1.
