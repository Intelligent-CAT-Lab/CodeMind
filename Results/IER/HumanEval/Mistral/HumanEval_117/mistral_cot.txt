 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `select_words` takes two arguments: `s` and `n`. `s` is a string and `n` is an integer.
The function initializes an empty list called `result` which will be used to store the selected words.
The function then iterates over each word in the string `s` using the `split()` method.
For each word, it counts the number of consonants in the word by iterating over each character in the word and checking if it is not a vowel.
If the count of consonants is equal to `n`, the word is added to the `result` list.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the `result` list.
<<<Output>>>
['Mary', 'little', 'lamb']
