 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `next_smallest` takes a list `lst` as input.
It first converts the list to a set using the `set()` function, which removes any duplicate values.
Then it converts the set back to a list using the `list()` function.
The resulting list is sorted using the `sorted()` function.
The function then checks if the length of the sorted list is less than 2. If it is, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the second element of the sorted list, which is the next smallest value.
In this case, the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
After sorting the list, it becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
Since the length of the sorted list is 5, which is greater than 2, the function returns the second element of the sorted list, which is 2.
