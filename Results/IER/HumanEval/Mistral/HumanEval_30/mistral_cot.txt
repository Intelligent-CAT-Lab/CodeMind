 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `get_positive` takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the elements that are greater than 0.
The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of the input list and check if they are greater than 0. If they are, they are added to a new list.
The input list `[-1, -2, 4, 5, 6]` contains both positive and negative elements. The function will only return the positive elements, which are 4, 5 and 6.
<<<Output>>>
[4, 5, 6]
