 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `do_algebra` takes two arguments: `operator` and `operand`.
The `operator` argument is a list of operators, and the `operand` argument is a list of operands.
The function first converts the first operand to a string using the `str()` function and stores it in the variable `expression`.
Then, it uses a `zip()` function to iterate over the `operator` and `operand` lists simultaneously. For each iteration, it concatenates the operator and operand to the `expression` string using the `+=` operator.
Finally, the function evaluates the expression string using the `eval()` function and returns the result.
For the input `do_algebra(['**', '*', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 5])`, the function will perform the following operations:
- `**` raised to the power of `2` is `4`
- `*` multiplied by `3` is `9`
- `+` added to `4` is `9`
Therefore, the return value of the function will be `9`.
