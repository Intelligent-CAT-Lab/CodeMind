I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    for i, l1 in enumerate(l):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(l)):
            if l1 + l[j] == 0:
                return True
    return False

<Code>

What would be the return value of `pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The variable l is initialized to [1, 3, 5, 0].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(l) - 1, meaning it will consider all pairs of numbers in the list.
For each pair of numbers i and j, it checks if i + j == 0. If it is, it returns True.
The condition is met when i = 0 and j = 1, i = 1 and j = 2, i = 2 and j = 3, i = 3 and j = 4.
After the loop finishes, the code returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
