I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def words_string(s):
    if not s:
        return []

    s_list = []

    for letter in s:
        if letter == ',':
            s_list.append(' ')
        else:
            s_list.append(letter)

    s_list = "".join(s_list)
    return s_list.split()

<Code>

What would be the return value of `words_string("Hi, my name is John") `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to "Hi, my name is John".
The code checks if s is empty, which is not the case.
The variable s_list is initialized to an empty list.
The code iterates over the letters in s.
If the letter is a comma, it appends a space to s_list.
Otherwise, it appends the letter to s_list.
The variable s_list is joined into a string.
The string is split into a list of words.
The list is returned.
<<<Output>>>
['Hi','my', 'name', 'is', 'John']
