I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sort_array(array):
    return [] if len(array) == 0 else sorted(array, reverse= (array[0]+array[-1]) % 2 == 0) 

<Code>

What would be the return value of `sort_array([15, 42, 87, 32 ,11, 0]) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable array is initialized to [15, 42, 87, 32,11, 0].
The code checks if the length of array is 0, which is not the case.
The code then sorts the array in reverse order.
The code checks if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even.
If it is, the code returns the sorted array.
If it is not, the code returns an empty array.

In this case, the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, so the code returns the sorted array.

The sorted array is [0, 11, 32, 42, 87, 15].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 11, 32, 42, 87, 15]
