I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def valid_date(date):
    try:
        date = date.strip()
        month, day, year = date.split('-')
        month, day, year = int(month), int(day), int(year)
        if month < 1 or month > 12:
            return False
        if month in [1,3,5,7,8,10,12] and day < 1 or day > 31:
            return False
        if month in [4,6,9,11] and day < 1 or day > 30:
            return False
        if month == 2 and day < 1 or day > 29:
            return False
    except:
        return False

    return True

What would be the return value of `valid_date('03-11-2000') `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable date is initialized to '03-11-2000'.
The code then calls the function valid_date() with the input date.
The function valid_date() first checks if the input date is empty. If it is, it returns False.
Otherwise, it splits the input date into three parts: month, day and year.
It then checks if the month is within the range [1,12]. If it is, it checks if the day is within the range [1,31].
If it is, it returns True.
Otherwise, it checks if the month is within the range [4,6,9,11]. If it is, it checks if the day is within the range [1,30].
If it is, it returns True.
Otherwise, it checks if the month is within the range [1,3,5,7,8,10,12]. If it is, it checks if the day is within the range [1,31].
If it is, it returns True.
Otherwise, it checks if the month is within the range [2]. If it is, it checks if the day is within the range [1,29].
If it is, it returns True.
Otherwise, it returns False.

The function valid_date() returns True.
