I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    def xor(i, j):
        if i == j:
            return '0'
        else:
            return '1'

    return ''.join(xor(x, y) for x, y in zip(a, b))

<Code>

What would be the return value of `string_xor('111000', '101010') `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable a and variable b are initialized to '111000' and '101010', respectively.
The function xor takes two strings as input and returns a string.
The function string_xor takes two strings as input and returns a string.
The function string_xor calls the function xor to calculate the XOR of each pair of characters in the two strings.
The function string_xor then joins the XOR of each pair of characters in the two strings to form a new string.
The function string_xor returns the new string.
