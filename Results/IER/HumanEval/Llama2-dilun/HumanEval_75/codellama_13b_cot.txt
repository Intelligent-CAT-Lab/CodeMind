I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    def is_prime(n):
        for j in range(2,n):
            if n%j == 0:
                return False
        return True

    for i in range(2,101):
        if not is_prime(i): continue
        for j in range(2,101):
            if not is_prime(j): continue
            for k in range(2,101):
                if not is_prime(k): continue
                if i*j*k == a: return True
    return False

What would be the return value of `is_multiply_prime(5) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The variable a is initialized to 5.
The function is_prime is called to check if 5 is prime.
The function is_prime iterates from 2 to 101 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 101.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is prime.
If it is, it iterates from 2 to 101 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 101.
For each number j in this range, it checks if j is prime.
If it is, it iterates from 2 to 101 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 101.
For each number k in this range, it checks if k is prime.
If it is, it checks if i*j*k == a.
If it is, it returns True.
If it is not, it returns False.

The function is_multiply_prime iterates from 2 to 101 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 101.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is prime.
If it is, it iterates from 2 to 101 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 101.
For each number j in this range, it checks if j is prime.
If it is, it iterates from 2 to 101 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 101.
For each number k in this range, it checks if k is prime.
If it is, it checks if i*j*k == a.
If it is, it returns True.
If it is not, it returns False.

The function is_multiply_prime returns False.
