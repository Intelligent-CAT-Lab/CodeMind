I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def numerical_letter_grade(grades):

   
    letter_grade = []
    for gpa in grades:
        if gpa == 4.0:
            letter_grade.append("A+")
        elif gpa > 3.7:
            letter_grade.append("A")
        elif gpa > 3.3:
            letter_grade.append("A-")
        elif gpa > 3.0:
            letter_grade.append("B+")
        elif gpa > 2.7:
            letter_grade.append("B")
        elif gpa > 2.3:
            letter_grade.append("B-")
        elif gpa > 2.0:
            letter_grade.append("C+")
        elif gpa > 1.7:
            letter_grade.append("C")
        elif gpa > 1.3:
            letter_grade.append("C-")
        elif gpa > 1.0:
            letter_grade.append("D+")
        elif gpa > 0.7:
            letter_grade.append("D")
        elif gpa > 0.0:
            letter_grade.append("D-")
        else:
            letter_grade.append("E")
    return letter_grade

What would be the return value of `numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The input is [4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5].
The code first initializes the variable letter_grade to an empty list.
Then it iterates through the input list and checks if the current grade is 4.0. If it is, it appends "A+" to the list.
If the grade is greater than 3.7, it appends "A" to the list.
If the grade is greater than 3.3, it appends "A-" to the list.
If the grade is greater than 3.0, it appends "B+" to the list.
If the grade is greater than 2.7, it appends "B" to the list.
If the grade is greater than 2.3, it appends "B-" to the list.
If the grade is greater than 2.0, it appends "C+" to the list.
If the grade is greater than 1.7, it appends "C" to the list.
If the grade is greater than 1.3, it appends "C-" to the list.
If the grade is greater than 1.0, it appends "D+" to the list.
If the grade is greater than 0.7, it appends "D" to the list.
If the grade is greater than 0.0, it appends "D-" to the list.
If the grade is less than 0.0, it appends "E" to the list.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of letter_grade, which is ["A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D+", "D", "D-", "E"].
<<<Output>>>
["A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D+", "D", "D-", "E"]
