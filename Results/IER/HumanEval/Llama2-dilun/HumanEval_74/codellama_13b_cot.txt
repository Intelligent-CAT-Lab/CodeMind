I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    l1 = 0
    for st in lst1:
        l1 += len(st)
    
    l2 = 0
    for st in lst2:
        l2 += len(st)
    
    if l1 <= l2:
        return lst1
    else:
        return lst2

<Code>

What would be the return value of `total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi']) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The variable l1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the length of each string in lst1.
The variable l2 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the length of each string in lst2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each string in lst1. For each string, it adds the length of the string to l1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each string in lst2. For each string, it adds the length of the string to l2.
The code checks if l1 is less than or equal to l2. If it is, it returns lst1. Otherwise, it returns lst2.

In this case, l1 is 4 and l2 is 2. Since l1 is less than or equal to l2, the code returns lst1, which is ['hi', 'admin'].
<<<Output>>>
['hi', 'admin']
