I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def file_name_check(file_name):
    suf = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    lst = file_name.split(sep='.')
    if len(lst) != 2:
        return 'No'
    if not lst[1] in suf:
        return 'No'
    if len(lst[0]) == 0:
        return 'No'
    if not lst[0][0].isalpha():
        return 'No'
    t = len([x for x in lst[0] if x.isdigit()])
    if t > 3:
        return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

<Code>

What would be the return value of `file_name_check("example.txt") `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable file_name is initialized to "example.txt".
The code then splits the file name into two parts, using the dot as the separator.
The first part is "example" and the second part is "txt".
The code checks if the length of the first part is not 2, which is not the case here.
It then checks if the second part is not in the list of suffixes, which is not the case here.
It then checks if the first part is empty, which is not the case here.
It then checks if the first character of the first part is not a letter, which is not the case here.
It then checks if the number of digits in the first part is greater than 3, which is not the case here.
The code returns "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
