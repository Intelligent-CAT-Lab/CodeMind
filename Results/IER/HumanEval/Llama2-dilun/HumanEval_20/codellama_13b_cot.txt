I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    closest_pair = None
    distance = None

    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                if distance is None:
                    distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                    closest_pair = tuple(sorted([elem, elem2]))
                else:
                    new_distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                    if new_distance < distance:
                        distance = new_distance
                        closest_pair = tuple(sorted([elem, elem2]))

    return closest_pair

<Code>

What would be the return value of `find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The code iterates through the list of numbers and calculates the distance between each pair of numbers.
It then finds the closest pair of numbers and returns it.
