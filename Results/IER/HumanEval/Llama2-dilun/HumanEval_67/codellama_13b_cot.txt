I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    lis = list()
    for i in s.split(' '):
        if i.isdigit():
            lis.append(int(i))
    return n - sum(lis)

<Code>

What would be the return value of `fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges",19) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The input is "5 apples and 6 oranges" and n is 19.
The code first splits the input string by space, which gives ["5 apples", "6 oranges"].
Then it converts the strings to integers and stores them in a list.
The list is [5, 6].
The code then calculates the sum of the list, which is 11.
The code then returns 19 - 11, which is 8.
