I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sort_third(l: list):
    l = list(l)
    l[::3] = sorted(l[::3])
    return l

<Code>

What would be the return value of `tuple(sort_third([1, 2, 3])) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The input is a list [1, 2, 3].
The code first converts the list to a tuple, which is (1, 2, 3).
Then it sorts the elements in the tuple according to the third element, which is 3.
The final result is (3, 2, 1).
<<<Output>>>
(3, 2, 1)
