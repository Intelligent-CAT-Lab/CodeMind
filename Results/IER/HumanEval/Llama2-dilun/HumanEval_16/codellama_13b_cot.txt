I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len(set(string.lower()))

print(count_distinct_characters('abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE'))
<Code>

What would be the return value of `count_distinct_characters('abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE') `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable string is initialized to 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE'.
The code then calls the function count_distinct_characters, which returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
The function count_distinct_characters takes the string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
The function first converts the string to lowercase and then uses the set() function to create a set of distinct characters.
The len() function is then used to return the number of distinct characters in the set.
The final return value of the function is 10, which is the number of distinct characters in the string.
<<<Output>>>
10
