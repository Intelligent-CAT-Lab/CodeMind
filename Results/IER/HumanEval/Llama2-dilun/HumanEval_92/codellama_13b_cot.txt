I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def any_int(x, y, z):
    
    if isinstance(x,int) and isinstance(y,int) and isinstance(z,int):
        if (x+y==z) or (x+z==y) or (y+z==x):
            return True
        return False
    return False

<Code>

What would be the return value of `any_int(2, 3, 1)`?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x, y and z are initialized to 2, 3 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if all three variables are integers. If they are, it checks if the sum of x and y is equal to z, the sum of x and z is equal to y, or the sum of y and z is equal to x.
If any of these conditions is met, the code returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
In this case, the sum of x and y is 5, which is not equal to z. The sum of x and z is 4, which is not equal to y. The sum of y and z is 4, which is not equal to x.
Therefore, the code returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
