I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    ret = []
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if i%2 == 0:
            x = 1
            for j in range(1,i+1): x *= j
            ret += [x]
        else:
            x = 0
            for j in range(1,i+1): x += j
            ret += [x]
    return ret

<Code>

What would be the return value of `f(5) `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even or odd. If it is even, it sets x to 1 and then calculates the product of i and all numbers from 1 to i. It then adds this product to the list ret.
If it is odd, it sets x to 0 and then calculates the sum of i and all numbers from 1 to i. It then adds this sum to the list ret.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ret, which is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
