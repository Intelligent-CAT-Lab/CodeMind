I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the return value of a function .

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sum_of_integer(N, A, B):
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    return sum_1
</Code>
What would be the return value of `sum_of_integer(20, 2, 5)`?
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    value_map = {
        'zero': 0,
        'one': 1,
        'two': 2,
        'three': 3,
        'four': 4,
        'five': 5,
        'six': 6,
        'seven': 7,
        'eight': 8,
        'nine': 9
    }
    return ' '.join(sorted([x for x in numbers.split(' ') if x], key=lambda x: value_map[x]))

<Code>

What would be the return value of `sort_numbers('five zero four seven nine eight') `?

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the return value of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable numbers is initialized to 'five zero four seven nine eight'.
The variable value_map is initialized to a dictionary with the keys 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five','six','seven', 'eight', 'nine' and the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, respectively.
The code then splits the string numbers into a list of strings using the space character as the delimiter.
The code then iterates through the list of strings and checks if each string is in the dictionary value_map. If it is, it adds the string to a new list.
The code then sorts the list of strings using the key function, which sorts the strings based on their corresponding values in the dictionary value_map.
The code then joins the sorted list of strings using the space character as the delimiter and returns the result.
The final result is 'five zero four seven nine eight'.
<<<Output>>>
five zero four seven nine eight
