  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 123.
The code defines a function called is_palindrome(n) that takes an integer n as input and returns True if the string representation of n is the same as its reverse, and False otherwise.
The code defines two variables even_palindrome_count and odd_palindrome_count, which will be used to count the number of even and odd palindromes, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 123.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if i is odd or even and if it is a palindrome. If it is an odd palindrome, it adds 1 to the variable odd_palindrome_count. If it is an even palindrome, it adds 1 to the variable even_palindrome_count.
After the loop finishes, the code returns a tuple containing the values of even_palindrome_count and odd_palindrome_count.
