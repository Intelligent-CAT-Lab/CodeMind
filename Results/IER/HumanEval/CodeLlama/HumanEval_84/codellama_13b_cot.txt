<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes an integer N as input and returns its binary representation as a string.
The function first converts the input N to a string using the str() function.
It then uses a list comprehension to convert each character in the string to an integer using the int() function.
The resulting list of integers is then summed using the sum() function.
The binary representation of the sum is obtained using the bin() function.
The function returns the binary representation as a string, but it starts with "0b", which is not desired.
The function uses slicing to remove the "0b" prefix from the string and return the remaining part as the output.
