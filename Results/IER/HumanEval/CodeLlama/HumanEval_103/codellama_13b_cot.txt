<<<Analysis>>>
The function rounded_avg takes two integer arguments n and m.
The function checks if m is less than n, and if it is, it returns -1.
If m is greater than or equal to n, the function calculates the sum of the numbers from n to m, inclusive, and stores it in the variable summation.
The function then calculates the average of these numbers and rounds it to the nearest integer.
The function then returns the binary representation of this rounded average.

In this case, n is 1 and m is 5, so the function calculates the sum of the numbers from 1 to 5, inclusive, which is 15.
The function then calculates the average of these numbers, which is 3.
The function then rounds this average to the nearest integer, which is 3.
The function then returns the binary representation of 3, which is 11.

<<<Output>>>
11
