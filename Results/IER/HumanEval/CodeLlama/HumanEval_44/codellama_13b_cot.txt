<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments: x, which is an integer, and base, which is also an integer.
The function first initializes an empty string ret.
It then enters a loop that iterates while x is greater than 0.
For each iteration, it calculates the remainder of x divided by base and stores it in ret.
It then divides x by base and repeats the process.
The loop stops when x is 0.
The function then returns the final value of ret.

Based on the analysis, the return value of `change_base(8, 3)` would be "100".
<<<Output>>>
100
