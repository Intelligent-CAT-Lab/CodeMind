<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_simple_power takes two arguments, x and n.
The function first checks if n is equal to 1, and if it is, it returns whether x is equal to 1.
If n is not equal to 1, the function initializes a variable power to 1.
The function then enters a loop that iterates while power is less than x.
In each iteration, the loop multiplies power by n.
After the loop finishes, the function returns whether power is equal to x.

In this case, x is 16 and n is 2.
The function first checks if n is equal to 1, and since it is not, it initializes power to 1.
The loop iterates 4 times, multiplying power by 2 each time.
After the loop finishes, power is equal to 16, and the function returns whether 16 is equal to 16, which is true.

Therefore, the return value of is_simple_power(16, 2) is true.
<<<Output>>>
True
