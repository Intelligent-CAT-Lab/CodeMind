<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list as input and returns a tuple.
The function first creates two lists, evens and odds, by slicing the input list into even and odd indices.
The function then sorts the evens list and zips it with the odds list.
The function then appends the last element of the evens list to the ans list if it is longer than the odds list.
The function finally returns the ans list as a tuple.

The input list is [1, 2, 3], which is odd.
The evens list is [2], which is even.
The odds list is [1, 3], which is odd.
The evens list is sorted to [2].
The function zips the evens list with the odds list to get [(2, 1), (2, 3)].
The function appends the last element of the evens list to the ans list, which is [2].
The function returns the ans list as a tuple, which is (2,).

<<<Output>>>
(2,)
