  <<<Analysis>>>
The function will_it_fly takes three arguments: q, w, and x.
The function first checks if the sum of the elements in q is greater than w. If it is, it returns False.
The function then initializes two variables, i and j, to 0 and the length of q minus 1, respectively.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates as long as i is less than j.
Inside the loop, the function checks if the elements at indices i and j are equal. If they are not, it returns False.
If they are equal, the function increments i and decrements j.
After the loop finishes, the function returns True.
