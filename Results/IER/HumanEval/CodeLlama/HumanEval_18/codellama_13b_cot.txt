<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two string arguments, string and substring.
The function returns an integer representing the number of times the substring appears in the string.
The function uses a for loop to iterate over the string, starting from the beginning and ending at the end of the string minus the length of the substring.
For each iteration, the function checks if the substring appears at the current position by comparing it to the substring.
If it appears, the function increments the times variable by 1.
The function returns the final value of times.
