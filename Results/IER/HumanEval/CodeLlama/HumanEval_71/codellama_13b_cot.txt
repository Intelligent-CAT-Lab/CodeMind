<<<Analysis>>>
The code checks if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the third side. If this condition is not met, the function returns -1.
The code then calculates the semi-perimeter of the triangle, which is (a + b + c)/2.
The code then calculates the area of the triangle using the formula (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5, where s is the semi-perimeter.
The code rounds the area to 2 decimal places and returns it.

Since the sum of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the third side, the function does not return -1.
The semi-perimeter is (3 + 4 + 5)/2 = 12/2 = 6.
The area of the triangle is (6 * (6 - 3) * (6 - 4) * (6 - 5)) ** 0.5 = 12 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 72.
The area is rounded to 2 decimal places, so the return value is 72.00.
<<<Output>>>
72.00
