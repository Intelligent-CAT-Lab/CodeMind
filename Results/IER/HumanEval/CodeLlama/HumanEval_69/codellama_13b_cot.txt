<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of integers as input.
The function first initializes an array frq with length equal to the maximum value in the input list plus 1.
The function then iterates through the input list and increments the corresponding index in frq.
The function then iterates through frq and checks if the value at each index is greater than or equal to the index itself. If it is, it sets the return value to that index.
The function returns -1 if no such index is found.

In this case, the input list is [5, 5, 5, 5, 1]. The maximum value in the list is 5, so the function initializes frq with length 6.
The function then iterates through the input list and increments the corresponding indices in frq.
The function then iterates through frq and checks if the value at each index is greater than or equal to the index itself.
The function finds that the value at index 5 is greater than or equal to 5, so it sets the return value to 5.

<<<Output>>>
5
