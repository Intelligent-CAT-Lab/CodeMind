<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_sorted takes a list as input.
The function first initializes a dictionary count_digit with keys as the elements of the input list and values as 0.
The function then iterates over the input list and increments the value of the corresponding key in the dictionary by 1.
The function then checks if any key in the dictionary has a value greater than 2. If it does, it returns False.
If none of the keys have a value greater than 2, the function checks if all the elements in the input list are in sorted order. If they are, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

In this case, the input list is [5]. The dictionary count_digit is initialized with {5:0}. The function then increments the value of 5 in the dictionary by 1, resulting in {5:1}. Since no key has a value greater than 2, the function checks if all the elements in the input list are in sorted order. Since there is only one element, it is already in sorted order, so the function returns True.
