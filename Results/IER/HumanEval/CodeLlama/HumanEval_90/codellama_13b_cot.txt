<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list as input and returns the next smallest element in the list.
The function first sorts the list and removes any duplicates using the set() function.
The function then checks if the length of the list is less than 2, and if it is, it returns None.
If the length of the list is greater than or equal to 2, the function returns the second element of the sorted and deduplicated list.

In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which is sorted and deduplicated to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The function returns the second element of the sorted and deduplicated list, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
