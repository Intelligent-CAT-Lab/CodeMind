<<<Analysis>>>
The function same_chars takes two strings as input, s0 and s1.
The function returns True if the two strings have the same characters, and False otherwise.
The function does this by converting the strings to sets and comparing them.
The set of characters in s0 is {e, a, b, c, d, z}.
The set of characters in s1 is {d, d, d, z, z, z, z, z, z, e, d, d, a, b, c}.
Since the sets are not equal, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
