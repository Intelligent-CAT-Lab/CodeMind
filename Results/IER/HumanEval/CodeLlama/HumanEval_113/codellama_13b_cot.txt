<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of strings as input.
The function first initializes an empty list called res.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the input list.
For each element arr in the input list, it calculates the number of odd elements in arr using the sum function and a generator expression.
The generator expression checks if each digit in arr is odd by using the modulo operator (%) and checking if the result is equal to 1.
The function then appends a string to the res list that describes the number of odd elements in arr.
The function repeats this process for each element in the input list.
The function then returns the final value of res, which is a list of strings.
<<<Output>>>
['the number of odd elements 4 in the string 1234567']
