<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5, which means the code will iterate from 2 to 5 (inclusive).
The code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it checks if it is a prime number by iterating from 2 to i (inclusive) and checking if i is divisible by any number in that range.
If i is a prime number, it is added to the list primes.
The code returns the list primes, which contains the prime numbers from 2 to 5, which are 2, 3 and 5.
<<<Output>>>
[2, 3, 5]
