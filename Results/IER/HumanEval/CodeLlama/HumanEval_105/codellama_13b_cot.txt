  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3].
The variable dic is initialized to a dictionary with keys 1 to 9 and their corresponding values.
The variable sorted_arr is initialized to the sorted version of arr in descending order.
The variable new_arr is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of sorted_arr.
For each element var in sorted_arr, it tries to append the value of dic[var] to new_arr.
If var is not a key in dic, it will raise a KeyError, which is caught by the except block and the loop continues.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of new_arr, which is ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"].
<<<Output>>>
["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]
