<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of integers as input.
The function first filters the list to create two new lists: smallest and largest.
The smallest list contains all the negative numbers in the input list, and the largest list contains all the positive numbers.
The function then returns the largest and smallest numbers in the smallest and largest lists, respectively.
If either list is empty, the function returns None.

In this case, the input list is [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7].
The smallest list contains only the negative number -1, and the largest list contains only the positive number 7.
The function returns (None, 7).
<<<Output>>>
(None, 7)
