<<<Analysis>>>
The function specialFilter takes a list of numbers as input.
The function first initializes a variable count to 0.
It then iterates through the list of numbers and checks if each number is greater than 10.
If a number is greater than 10, it checks if the first and last digits of the number are odd.
If both conditions are met, it increments the count variable by 1.
The function then returns the final value of count.

In this case, the input list is [5, -2, 1, -5].
The first number 5 is greater than 10, but its first and last digits are not odd.
The second number -2 is less than 10, so it is not considered.
The third number 1 is less than 10, so it is not considered.
The fourth number -5 is greater than 10, but its first and last digits are not odd.
Therefore, the count variable is incremented by 0, and the function returns 0.
