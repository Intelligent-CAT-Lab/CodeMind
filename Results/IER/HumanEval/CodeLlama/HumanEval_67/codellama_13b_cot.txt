<<<Analysis>>>
The function fruit_distribution takes two arguments, s and n.
s is a string that contains the number of apples and oranges.
n is an integer that represents the total number of fruits.
The function first splits the string s into a list of words using the split() method.
The list is then iterated over, and each word is checked to see if it is a digit using the isdigit() method.
If a word is a digit, it is converted to an integer and appended to a new list called lis.
The function then returns the difference between n and the sum of the elements in lis.

In this case, the string s is "5 apples and 6 oranges", and n is 19.
The function splits the string into a list of words: ["5", "apples", "and", "6", "oranges"].
The function then iterates over the list and checks each word to see if it is a digit.
The words "apples" and "oranges" are not digits, so they are not included in the list lis.
The words "5" and "6" are digits, so they are converted to integers and appended to the list lis.
The list lis now contains the integers [5, 6].
The function then returns the difference between n and the sum of the elements in lis, which is 19 - (5 + 6) = 8.
