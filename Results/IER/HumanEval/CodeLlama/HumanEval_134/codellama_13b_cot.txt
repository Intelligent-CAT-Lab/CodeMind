<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string argument, txt.
The function splits the string into a list of words using the space character as a delimiter.
The function then accesses the last element of the list and assigns it to the variable check.
The function then checks if the last character of the last word is a letter by checking if the length of the last word is 1 and if the ASCII value of the last character is between 97 and 122, which corresponds to the lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
<<<Output>>>
