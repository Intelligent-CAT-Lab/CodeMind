<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes an array of integers as input and returns a sorted array of integers.
The function first sorts the input array using the built-in sorted() function.
The function then sorts the sorted array using the key parameter of the sorted() function, which is a lambda function that takes each element of the array and returns its binary representation.
The lambda function then counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of each element and returns the count.
The sorted() function then sorts the array based on the count of '1's in the binary representation of each element.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
