<<<Analysis>>>
The function fibfib takes an integer argument n.
The function first checks if n is equal to 0, 1, or 2. If it is, it returns the corresponding value.
If n is not equal to 0, 1, or 2, the function calls itself recursively with n - 1, n - 2, and n - 3 as arguments.
The function then adds the return values of these recursive calls and returns the result.

The function will return 1 when n is 2, because the function calls itself with n - 1 and n - 2 as arguments, which both return 0.
The function will return 0 when n is 1, because the function calls itself with n - 1 as an argument, which returns 0.
The function will return 0 when n is 0, because the function does not call itself recursively and returns 0 directly.
