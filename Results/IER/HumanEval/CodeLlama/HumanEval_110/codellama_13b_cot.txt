<<<Analysis>>>
The function exchange takes two lists as input, lst1 and lst2.
The function first iterates through lst1 and counts the number of odd numbers in the list.
It then iterates through lst2 and counts the number of even numbers in the list.
The function then checks if the number of even numbers in lst2 is greater than or equal to the number of odd numbers in lst1.
If this condition is met, the function returns "YES", otherwise it returns "NO".

In this case, both lst1 and lst2 have the same number of elements, and all elements are either odd or even.
Therefore, the number of odd numbers in lst1 is equal to the number of even numbers in lst2, and the function returns "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
