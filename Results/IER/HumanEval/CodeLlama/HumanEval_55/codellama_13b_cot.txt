The function fib takes an integer n as input.
The function first checks if n is equal to 0, and if it is, it returns 0.
The function then checks if n is equal to 1, and if it is, it returns 1.
If neither of these conditions are met, the function calls itself twice with n-1 and n-2 as inputs, and adds the results together.
This process continues until the function reaches the base case of n=0 or n=1, at which point it returns the appropriate value.

The function fib(10) will call itself with n=9 and n=8 as inputs, and add the results together.
This will continue until the function reaches the base case of n=0 or n=1, at which point it returns the appropriate value.

The final output of the function will be the sum of the values returned by the recursive calls, which will be 55.
