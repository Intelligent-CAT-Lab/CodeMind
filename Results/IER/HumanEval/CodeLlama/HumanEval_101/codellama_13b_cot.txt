<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string argument s.
The function checks if s is empty, and if it is, it returns an empty list.
If s is not empty, the function creates a list called s_list.
The function then iterates through each character in s and appends it to s_list.
If the character is a comma, the function appends a space to s_list instead.
After the loop finishes, the function joins the elements of s_list into a single string using the "".join() method.
Finally, the function splits the resulting string into a list of words using the .split() method.
The return value of the function is the list of words.
<<<Output>>>
['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']
