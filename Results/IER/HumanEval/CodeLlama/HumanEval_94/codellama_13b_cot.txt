  <<<Analysis>>>
The function skjkasdkd takes a list of integers as input.
The function isPrime is defined inside the function skjkasdkd.
The function isPrime checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if it is divisible by any number in that range.
The function skjkasdkd iterates through the list of integers and checks if each number is prime. If a number is prime, it is compared to the current maximum prime number and if it is greater, it becomes the new maximum prime number.
The function skjkasdkd then returns the sum of the digits of the maximum prime number.
