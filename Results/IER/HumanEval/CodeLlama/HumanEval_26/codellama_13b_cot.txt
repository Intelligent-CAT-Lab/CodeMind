<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers without duplicates.
The function first imports the collections module and uses the Counter class to count the frequency of each element in the input list.
The function then creates a new list by iterating over the input list and only including elements that have a frequency of 1 or less.
The function returns this new list.

In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5].
The Counter class will count the frequency of each element in the list, resulting in a dictionary with the following keys and values:
{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1}
The function will then create a new list by iterating over the input list and only including elements that have a frequency of 1 or less.
The resulting list will be [1, 2, 4, 5].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 4, 5]
