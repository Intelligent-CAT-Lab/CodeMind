<<<Analysis>>>
The function intersection takes two intervals as input, which are represented as tuples of two integers.
The function first defines a helper function is_prime, which checks if a given number is prime.
The function then calculates the length of the intersection of the two intervals, which is the maximum of the left endpoints minus the minimum of the right endpoints.
If the length of the intersection is positive and a prime number, the function returns "YES", otherwise it returns "NO".

In this case, the input intervals are (1, 2) and (2, 3). The length of the intersection is 1, which is a prime number. Therefore, the function returns "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
