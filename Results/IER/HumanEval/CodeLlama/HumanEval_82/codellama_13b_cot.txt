<<<Analysis>>>
The function prime_length takes a string as input and returns True if the length of the string is a prime number, and False otherwise.
The function first checks if the length of the string is 0 or 1, and if it is, it returns False.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the length of the string (exclusive), and checks if the length of the string is divisible by any number in this range. If it is, the function returns False.
If the loop finishes without returning False, the function returns True.

In this case, the length of the string 'Hello' is 5, which is not a prime number. Therefore, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
