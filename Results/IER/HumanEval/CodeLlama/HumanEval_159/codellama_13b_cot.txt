<<<Analysis>>>
The function eat takes three arguments: number, need, and remaining.
The function checks if need is less than or equal to remaining.
If it is, it returns a list with the sum of number and need as the first element and the difference between remaining and need as the second element.
If need is greater than remaining, it returns a list with the sum of number and remaining as the first element and 0 as the second element.

In this case, the input is eat(5, 6, 10).
The function checks if 6 is less than or equal to 10.
It is, so it returns [5 + 6, 10 - 6], which is [11, 4].

<<<Output>>>
[11, 4]
