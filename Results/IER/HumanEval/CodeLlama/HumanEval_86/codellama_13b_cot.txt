<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string argument s and returns a string.
The code first splits the input string s into a list of words using the split() method with a space as the delimiter.
The list of words is then mapped to a new list of strings using the sorted() method, which sorts each word in the list.
The sorted words are then joined back into a single string using the join() method with a space as the delimiter.
The final string is returned.

In this case, the input string is 'Hi', which is split into a list ['Hi'].
The list is mapped to a new list ['Hi'] using the sorted() method, which returns ['Hi'].
The sorted words are then joined back into a single string using the join() method with a space as the delimiter, resulting in the output 'Hi'.

<<<Output>>>
'Hi'
