<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes an array as input and returns an empty array if the length of the input array is 0.
If the length of the input array is not 0, the function sorts the array using the sorted() function and the reverse parameter is set to True if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even, and False otherwise.
The code then returns the sorted array.

In this case, the input array is [15, 42, 87, 32, 11, 0].
The sum of the first and last elements of the array is 15 + 0 = 15, which is odd.
Therefore, the function returns the sorted array without reversing it.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87]
