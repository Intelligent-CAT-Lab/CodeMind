The variable num is initialized to "AB", which is a string.
The variable primes is initialized to a tuple containing the strings "2", "3", "5", "7", "B", and "D".
The variable total is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times a prime number is found in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string num.
For each character i in the string, it checks if i is in the tuple primes. If it is, it adds 1 to total.
The condition is met when i is "A" and "B", which are both in the tuple primes.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of total, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
