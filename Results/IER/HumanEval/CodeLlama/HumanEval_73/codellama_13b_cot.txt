<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized to [1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the half of the length of arr (inclusive), which is 4 in this case.
For each iteration, the code checks if the element at the current index i is equal to the element at the index len(arr) - i - 1.
The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2 and 3.
The code then increments the variable ans by 1 for each iteration.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ans, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
