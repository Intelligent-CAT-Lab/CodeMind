<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two arguments, x and n, which are strings representing fractions.
The function splits each string into two parts using the "/" character as a delimiter.
The first part is assigned to a and c, and the second part is assigned to b and d.
The numerator is calculated as the product of a and c, and the denominator is calculated as the product of b and d.
The function then checks if the result of the division of the numerator by the denominator is an integer.
If it is, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.

In this case, the function is called with the arguments "1/5" and "5/1".
The function splits these strings into a = 1, b = 5, c = 5, and d = 1.
The numerator is calculated as 5, and the denominator is calculated as 5.
The result of the division is 1, which is an integer, so the function returns True.

<<<Output>>>
True
