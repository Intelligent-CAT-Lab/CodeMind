<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized to 7.
The code then converts the absolute value of num to a string using the str() function.
The string "7" is then iterated over using a for loop.
For each character i in the string, the code checks if the integer value of i is even or odd using the modulo operator (%).
If the integer value of i is even, the code increments the variable even_count by 1.
If the integer value of i is odd, the code increments the variable odd_count by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns a tuple containing the values of even_count and odd_count.
<<<Output>>>
(0, 1)
