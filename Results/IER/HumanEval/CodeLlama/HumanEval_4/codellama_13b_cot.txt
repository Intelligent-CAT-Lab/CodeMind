<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of floating-point numbers as input.
The function first calculates the mean of the list using the formula:
mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
In this case, the list is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], so the mean is (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0) / 3 = 2.0.
The function then calculates the absolute deviation of each number from the mean and returns the sum of these deviations divided by the length of the list.
The absolute deviation of a number x from the mean is |x - mean|.
In this case, the absolute deviations are:
|1.0 - 2.0| = 1.0
|2.0 - 2.0| = 0.0
|3.0 - 2.0| = 1.0
The sum of these deviations is 2.0.
The function returns the sum of deviations divided by the length of the list, which is 2.0 / 3 = 0.67.
<<<Output>>>
0.67
