<<<Analysis>>>
The function common takes two lists as input, l1 and l2.
The function creates an empty set called ret.
The function then iterates through each element in l1 and l2 and checks if they are equal.
If they are equal, the function adds the element to the set ret.
The function then returns the sorted list of elements in ret.

In this case, the function will return the common elements between the two lists, which are 1, 5, and 653.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 5, 653]
