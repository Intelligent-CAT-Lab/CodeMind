<<<Analysis>>>
The function triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as input.
The code iterates through the list using three nested for loops.
The outer loop iterates through the list from index 0 to the last index.
The middle loop iterates through the list from the current index to the last index.
The inner loop iterates through the list from the current index to the last index.
The code checks if the sum of the elements at the current indices is equal to 0.
If it is, the function returns True.
If the loop finishes without finding a sum of 0, the function returns False.

In this case, the input list is [1, 3, 5, 0].
The outer loop iterates through the list from index 0 to index 3.
The middle loop iterates through the list from index 0 to index 2.
The inner loop iterates through the list from index 0 to index 1.
The code checks if 1 + 3 + 5 == 0, which is False.
The middle loop iterates through the list from index 1 to index 2.
The inner loop iterates through the list from index 1 to index 2.
The code checks if 3 + 5 + 0 == 0, which is True.
The function returns True.
