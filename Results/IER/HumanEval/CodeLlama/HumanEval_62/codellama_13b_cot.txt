<<<Analysis>>>
The function derivative takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers.
The function uses the enumerate function to iterate over the list of numbers and returns a list of tuples containing the index and the number at that index.
The list comprehension then multiplies each number by its index and returns a list of numbers.
The function then returns the list of numbers starting from the second element.

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 2, 4, 5]
