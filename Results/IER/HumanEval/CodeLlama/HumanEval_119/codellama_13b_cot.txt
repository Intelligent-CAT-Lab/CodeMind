  <<<Analysis>>>
The function match_parens takes a list of strings as input.
The function check is defined inside match_parens and takes a string as input.
The function check iterates through the string and checks if the number of opening parentheses is equal to the number of closing parentheses.
If the number of opening parentheses is greater than the number of closing parentheses, it returns False.
If the number of opening parentheses is equal to the number of closing parentheses, it returns True.
The function match_parens takes the first two elements of the input list and concatenates them to form two strings S1 and S2.
It then calls the function check on both S1 and S2.
If either of the calls to check returns True, the function returns 'Yes'.
If both calls to check return False, the function returns 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
'Yes'
