<<<Analysis>>>
The function strlen takes a string as input and returns its length.
The code first defines a function called strlen with a single parameter string of type str.
The function returns the length of the string using the built-in len function.
The code then calls the function with the input 'asdasnakj' and returns the length of the string, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
