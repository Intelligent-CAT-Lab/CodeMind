<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers.
The function uses a running maximum variable to keep track of the maximum value seen so far.
The function iterates over the input list and for each element, it checks if the current element is greater than the running maximum. If it is, it updates the running maximum.
The function then appends the running maximum to the result list.
The function returns the result list.

In this case, the input list is [3,2,3,100,3].
The function iterates over the list and updates the running maximum as follows:

* For the first element 3, the running maximum is initialized to 3.
* For the second element 2, the running maximum is updated to 3.
* For the third element 3, the running maximum is updated to 3.
* For the fourth element 100, the running maximum is updated to 100.
* For the fifth element 3, the running maximum is updated to 100.

The function returns the result list [3,3,3,100,100].

<<<Output>>>
[3, 3, 3, 100, 100]
