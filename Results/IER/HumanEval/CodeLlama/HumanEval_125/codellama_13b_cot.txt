<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string argument, txt.
The function checks if the string contains a space character. If it does, it splits the string into a list of words using the split() method.
If the string does not contain a space, the function checks if it contains a comma. If it does, it replaces the comma with a space and then splits the string into a list of words.
If the string does not contain either a space or a comma, the function returns the number of lowercase letters in the string that have an even ASCII value.

In this case, the input string is "Hello world!". It does not contain a space, but it does contain a comma. The function replaces the comma with a space and then splits the string into a list of words. The resulting list is ["Hello", "world!"].

<<<Output>>>
["Hello", "world!"]
