<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3, which is the input to the function.
The code then creates a list comprehension that generates a list of numbers.
The list comprehension iterates from 0 to n (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the expression n + 2*i and adds it to the list.
The list comprehension generates the following list: [3, 5, 7].
The code then returns this list.
<<<Output>>>
[3, 5, 7]
