  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first splits the sentence into a list of words using the split() method.
The code then iterates over each word in the list and checks if it meets the conditions to be included in the output.
The conditions are:
1. The word must have a length of 1 or 2.
2. The word must not be divisible by any number greater than 2.
If the word meets these conditions, it is added to a new list called new_lst.
After the loop finishes, the code joins the words in new_lst into a single string using the join() method and returns it.

<<<Output>>>
"This is a test"
