<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of strings as input.
The code first sorts the list using the sort() method.
The code then creates a new list called new_lst.
The code then iterates through the sorted list using a for loop.
For each string in the list, it checks if the length of the string is even.
If the length is even, it appends the string to the new_lst.
The code then returns the sorted new_lst using the sorted() function.

The input to the function is ["aa", "a", "aaa"].
The sorted list is ["a", "aa", "aaa"].
The new_lst is ["aa", "aaa"].
The sorted new_lst is ["aa", "aaa"].

<<<Output>>>
["aa", "aaa"]
