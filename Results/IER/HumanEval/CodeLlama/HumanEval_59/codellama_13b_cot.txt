The variable n is initialized to 15, which is the input to the function.
The function largest_prime_factor(n) is defined.
The function is_prime(k) is defined.
The variable largest is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the largest prime factor of n.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 16.
For each number j in this range, it checks if n is divisible by j and if j is prime.
If both conditions are met, it updates the value of largest to the maximum of largest and j.
The loop finishes and the code returns the final value of largest, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
