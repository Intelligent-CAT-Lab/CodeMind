The function valid_date takes a string argument date.
The function first strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the date string using the strip() method.
The function then splits the date string into three parts using the split() method, with each part separated by a hyphen.
The function then converts each part to an integer using the int() method.
The function then checks if the month is between 1 and 12, and if the day is between 1 and 31.
The function also checks if the month is in the list [1,3,5,7,8,10,12] and if the day is between 1 and 31.
The function also checks if the month is in the list [4,6,9,11] and if the day is between 1 and 30.
The function also checks if the month is equal to 2 and if the day is between 1 and 29.
If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns False.
