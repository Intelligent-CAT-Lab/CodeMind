<<<Analysis>>>
The function fib4 takes an integer n as input.
The function first initializes a list called results with the values [0, 0, 2, 0].
The function then checks if n is less than 4. If it is, it returns the corresponding element from the results list.
If n is greater than or equal to 4, the function enters a loop that iterates from 4 to n (inclusive).
For each iteration, the function appends the sum of the last four elements of the results list to the end of the list, and then pops the first element from the list.
The function then returns the last element of the results list.

Based on the analysis, the return value of fib4(5) would be 13.
<<<Output>>>
13
