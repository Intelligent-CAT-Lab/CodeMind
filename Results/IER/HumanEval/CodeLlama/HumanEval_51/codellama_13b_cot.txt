The function remove_vowels takes a string as input and returns a new string with all vowels removed.
The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string and check if each character is a vowel. If it is not, it is added to the output string.
The output string is then returned.

In this case, the input string is 'fedcba'. The code iterates over the characters in the string and checks if each character is a vowel. The only vowel in the string is 'a', which is not included in the output string.

Therefore, the return value of the function is 'fedcba' with all vowels removed.
<<<Output>>>
fedcba

The function remove_vowels takes a string as input and returns a new string with all vowels removed.
The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string and check if each character is a vowel. If it is not, it is added to the output string.
The output string is then returned.

In this case, the input string is 'aeiou'. The code iterates over the characters in the string and checks if each character is a vowel. All the characters in the string are vowels, so the output string is empty.

Therefore, the return value of the function is an empty string.
