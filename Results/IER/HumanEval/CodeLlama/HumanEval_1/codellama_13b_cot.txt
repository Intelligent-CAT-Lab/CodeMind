  <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of strings, where each string represents a group of parentheses.
The function uses a stack to keep track of the current depth of parentheses.
It iterates through each character in the input string and checks if it is an opening or closing parenthesis.
If it is an opening parenthesis, it increases the current depth by 1 and appends the character to the current string.
If it is a closing parenthesis, it decreases the current depth by 1 and appends the character to the current string.
If the current depth is 0 after an opening or closing parenthesis, it means that the current string is a complete group of parentheses, and it is appended to the result list.
The function then returns the result list.
<<<Output>>>
['(()())', '((()))', '((())()())']
