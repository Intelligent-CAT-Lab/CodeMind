The function compare_one takes two arguments, a and b.
The function first checks if a and b are strings by using the isinstance() function.
If either a or b is a string, the function replaces the comma with a dot using the replace() method.
The function then converts both a and b to floats using the float() function.
The function then checks if the two floats are equal using the == operator.
If they are not equal, the function returns the value of a if it is greater than b, or the value of b if it is greater than a.
If they are equal, the function returns None.

In this case, a is 1 and b is 2, so the function will return 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
