<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string argument called music_string.
The function first defines a dictionary called note_map, which maps musical notes to their corresponding integer values.
The function then splits the music_string argument into a list of individual notes using the split() method with a space as the delimiter.
The function then filters out any empty strings from the list using a list comprehension.
Finally, the function returns a list of integer values corresponding to the notes in the music_string argument.
