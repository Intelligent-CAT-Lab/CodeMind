<<<Analysis>>>
The function max_fill takes two arguments: grid and capacity.
The grid is a 2D array of integers, and capacity is an integer.
The function returns the maximum number of filled containers that can be made from the grid, given the capacity.
The function uses the sum function to calculate the total number of containers that can be made from the grid, and then uses the math.ceil function to round up the result to the nearest integer.
The function then returns the rounded-up result.

The input to the function is a 2D array of integers, and the capacity is an integer.
The function processes the input by iterating over each row of the grid and calculating the total number of containers that can be made from that row.
It then adds up the total number of containers from all the rows to get the final result.
