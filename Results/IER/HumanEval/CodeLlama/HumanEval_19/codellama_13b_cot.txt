<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string of numbers as input, separated by spaces.
The function first creates a dictionary called value_map, which maps each number word to its corresponding integer value.
The function then splits the input string into a list of individual numbers using the split() method.
The function then filters out any empty strings from the list using a list comprehension.
The function then sorts the list using the sorted() function, with the key being a lambda function that takes each number and returns its corresponding integer value from the value_map dictionary.
The function then joins the sorted list back into a string using the join() method, with each number separated by a space.
<<<Output>>>
'four five nine seven eight zero'
