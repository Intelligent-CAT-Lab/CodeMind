<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called encode that takes a string message as input.
The function first defines a variable called vowels, which is a string containing all the vowels in the English language.
The function then defines a variable called vowels_replace, which is a dictionary that maps each vowel in vowels to its corresponding character code plus 2.
The function then calls the swapcase() method on the message, which converts all the letters in the message to their corresponding uppercase or lowercase letters.
The function then returns a new string that is created by iterating over each character in the message and replacing any vowels with their corresponding values in vowels_replace.
If a character is not a vowel, it is left unchanged.
