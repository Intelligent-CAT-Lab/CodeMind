<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list as input, and returns the sum of elements that meet the following conditions:

* The element's index is even (i.e., the element is at an even position in the list).
* The element is odd.

The code uses a list comprehension to create a new list of elements that meet these conditions. The list comprehension consists of three parts:

1. `x for idx, x in enumerate(lst)`: This part creates a new list of elements by iterating over the input list `lst` and assigning each element a new index. The new list is called `x`.
2. `if idx%2==0 and x%2==1`: This part filters the elements in the new list `x` to only include elements that meet the conditions mentioned above. The condition is met when the element's index is even and the element is odd.
3. `sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx%2==0 and x%2==1])`: This part calculates the sum of the elements in the filtered list `x`.

The function returns the sum of the elements in the filtered list.
