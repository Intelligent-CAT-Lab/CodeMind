  <<<Analysis>>>
The function numerical_letter_grade takes a list of GPA scores as input.
The function first initializes an empty list called letter_grade.
The function then iterates through the list of GPA scores and checks each score against a series of if-else statements.
If the score is 4.0, the function appends "A+" to letter_grade.
If the score is greater than 3.7, the function appends "A" to letter_grade.
If the score is greater than 3.3, the function appends "A-" to letter_grade.
If the score is greater than 3.0, the function appends "B+" to letter_grade.
If the score is greater than 2.7, the function appends "B" to letter_grade.
If the score is greater than 2.3, the function appends "B-" to letter_grade.
If the score is greater than 2.0, the function appends "C+" to letter_grade.
If the score is greater than 1.7, the function appends "C" to letter_grade.
If the score is greater than 1.3, the function appends "C-" to letter_grade.
If the score is greater than 1.0, the function appends "D+" to letter_grade.
If the score is greater than 0.7, the function appends "D" to letter_grade.
If the score is greater than 0.0, the function appends "D-" to letter_grade.
If the score is less than or equal to 0.0, the function appends "E" to letter_grade.
The function then returns the list letter_grade.
