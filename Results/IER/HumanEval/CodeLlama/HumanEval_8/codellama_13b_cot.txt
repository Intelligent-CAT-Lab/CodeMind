<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of the elements in the list.
The function first initializes the sum and product values to 0.
It then iterates over the elements in the list using a for loop.
For each element, it adds the element to the sum and multiplies the product by the element.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the sum and product values as a tuple.

In this case, the input list is [1,1,1], so the function will return (3, 1).
<<<Output>>>
(3, 1)
