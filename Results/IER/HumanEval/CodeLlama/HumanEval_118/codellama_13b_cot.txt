  <<<Analysis>>>
The function get_closest_vowel takes a string argument word.
The function first checks if the length of the word is less than 3, and if it is, it returns an empty string.
The function then initializes a set of vowels, which includes the letters a, e, i, o, u, A, E, O, U, and I.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from the length of the word minus 2 to 0, inclusive.
For each iteration, the function checks if the character at the current index is in the set of vowels.
If it is, the function checks if the characters at the next and previous indices are not in the set of vowels.
If both conditions are met, the function returns the character at the current index.
If the loop finishes without returning a value, the function returns an empty string.

<<<Output>>>
"o"
