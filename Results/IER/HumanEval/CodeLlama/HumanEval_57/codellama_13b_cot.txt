<<<Analysis>>>
The function monotonic takes a list as input and checks if it is monotonic, meaning that all elements are in increasing or decreasing order.
The function first checks if the list is sorted in either ascending or descending order using the sorted() function.
If the list is sorted in either order, the function returns True.
If the list is not sorted in either order, the function returns False.

In this case, the input list is [1, 2, 4, 10].
The list is not sorted in either ascending or descending order, so the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
