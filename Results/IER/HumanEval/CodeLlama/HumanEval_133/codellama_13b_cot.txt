 
The output of the code is:

Hello, Alice!

Explanation:

The function `greet` takes a string `name` as input and returns a string "Hello, " concatenated with the input string and an exclamation mark. The function is then called with the argument "Alice", which is passed to the function as the variable `name`. The function returns the string "Hello, Alice!", which is then printed to the console.
