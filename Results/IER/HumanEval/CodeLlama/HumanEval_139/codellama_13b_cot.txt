The variable n is initialized to 4, which means the code will iterate from 1 to 4 (inclusive).
The variable fact_i is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the factorial of each number.
The variable special_fact is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the special factorial of each number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in fact_i.
The code then multiplies fact_i by special_fact and stores the result in special_fact.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of special_fact, which is 24.
<<<Output>>>
24
