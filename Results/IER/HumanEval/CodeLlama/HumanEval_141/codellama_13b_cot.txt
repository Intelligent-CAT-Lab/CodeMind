The variable file_name is initialized to "example.txt".
The code then splits the file name into a list of two elements using the dot (.) as the separator.
The list is stored in the variable lst.
The code checks if the length of lst is equal to 2, which it is in this case.
The code then checks if the second element of lst is in the list suf, which it is not.
The code then checks if the first element of lst is empty, which it is not.
The code then checks if the first character of the first element of lst is a letter, which it is.
The code then checks if the length of the first element of lst is greater than 3, which it is not.
The code then returns the string "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
