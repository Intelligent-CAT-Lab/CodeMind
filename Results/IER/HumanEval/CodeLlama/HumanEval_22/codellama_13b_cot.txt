<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of values as input and returns a list of integers.
The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and filter out non-integer values.
The list comprehension consists of two parts:
1. The first part is the variable x, which is assigned the value of each element in the input list.
2. The second part is the condition isinstance(x, int), which checks if x is an integer. If it is, the condition is True, and the element is included in the output list.

The input list is [3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b'].
The output list will contain the elements that are integers, which are 3, 3, and 3.

<<<Output>>>
[3, 3, 3]
