<<<Analysis>>>
The function prime_fib takes an integer n as input.
The function is_prime checks if a number p is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of p (exclusive) and checking if p is divisible by any of these numbers.
The function prime_fib initializes a list f with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1).
The function then enters an infinite loop that appends the sum of the last two elements of f to f and checks if the result is prime.
If the result is prime, the function decrements n.
If n becomes 0, the function returns the last element of f, which is the nth prime Fibonacci number.

The function prime_fib(1) will return the first prime Fibonacci number, which is 2.
