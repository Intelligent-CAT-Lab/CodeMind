<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_happy takes a string s as input.
The function first checks if the length of the string is less than 3, and if it is, it returns False.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the string minus 2.
For each iteration, the loop checks if the characters at positions i, i+1, and i+2 are the same.
If any of these conditions are met, the function returns False.
If the loop completes without returning False, the function returns True.

Based on this analysis, the return value of is_happy("a") would be False.
<<<Output>>>
False
