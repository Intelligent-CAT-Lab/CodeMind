The variable n is initialized to 50, which means the code will iterate from 0 to 49 (inclusive).
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it appends i to the list ns.
The code then converts the list ns to a string s using the join method.
The code then iterates over the characters in s and increments the variable ans for each character that is equal to '7'.
The code returns the final value of ans.
