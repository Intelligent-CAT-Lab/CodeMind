<<<Analysis>>>
The function decimal_to_binary takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation as a string.
The function first calls the built-in bin() function to convert the decimal number to a binary string.
The bin() function returns a string in the format "0b" followed by the binary representation of the number.
The function then returns the binary string with the "0b" prefix removed by slicing the string from the second character to the end.

The function decimal_to_binary(0) will return the binary representation of 0, which is "0b0".
The function will then return the binary string with the "0b" prefix removed, resulting in "0".
<<<Output>>>
"0"
