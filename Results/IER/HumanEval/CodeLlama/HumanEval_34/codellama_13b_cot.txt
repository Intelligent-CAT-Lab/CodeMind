<<<Analysis>>>
The function unique takes a list as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements.
The code first converts the input list to a set to remove duplicates.
The set is then converted back to a list and sorted.
The sorted list is then returned.

In this case, the input list is [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123].
The set of unique elements is [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123].
The sorted list is [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123].

<<<Output>>>
[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
