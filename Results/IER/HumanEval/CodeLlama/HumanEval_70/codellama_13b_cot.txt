<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list as input and returns a sorted list.
The function first initializes two variables, res and switch, to empty lists and True, respectively.
The function then enters a loop that iterates while lst is not empty.
In each iteration, the function appends the minimum or maximum element of lst to res, depending on the value of switch.
The function then removes the appended element from lst.
The function then switches the value of switch to its opposite.
The loop continues until lst is empty.
The function then returns res.

The input list is [1, 2, 3, 4].
The function appends 1 to res, then removes 1 from lst.
The function appends 2 to res, then removes 2 from lst.
The function appends 3 to res, then removes 3 from lst.
The function appends 4 to res, then removes 4 from lst.
The function then returns res, which is [1, 2, 3, 4].

<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4]
