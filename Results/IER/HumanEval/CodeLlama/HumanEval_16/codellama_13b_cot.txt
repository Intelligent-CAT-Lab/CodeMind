<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called count_distinct_characters that takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string.
The function first converts the input string to lowercase using the lower() method.
The function then creates a set of the characters in the string using the set() function.
The function then returns the length of the set, which is the number of distinct characters in the string.
The code then calls the function with the input string 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE'.
The input string is concatenated to form the string 'abcdecadeCADE'.
The function processes the input string and returns the number of distinct characters, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
