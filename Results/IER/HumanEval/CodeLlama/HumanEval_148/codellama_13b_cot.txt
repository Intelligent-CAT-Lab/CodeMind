<<<Analysis>>>
The function bf takes two arguments, planet1 and planet2.
The function first checks if both arguments are in the list of planet names and if they are not equal to each other.
If either of these conditions is not met, the function returns an empty tuple.
If the conditions are met, the function calculates the indices of the two planets in the list of planet names and checks which planet comes first.
If planet1 comes before planet2, the function returns a tuple containing the names of all the planets between planet1 and planet2, excluding planet1 and planet2.
If planet2 comes before planet1, the function returns a tuple containing the names of all the planets between planet2 and planet1, excluding planet1 and planet2.
<<<Output>>>
('Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune')
