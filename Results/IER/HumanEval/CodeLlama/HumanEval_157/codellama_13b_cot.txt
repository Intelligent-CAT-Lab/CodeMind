<<<Analysis>>>
The function right_angle_triangle takes three arguments a, b, and c.
The function returns true if a*a is equal to b*b + c*c or b*b is equal to a*a + c*c or c*c is equal to a*a + b*b.
The function returns false otherwise.

In this case, the input is 3, 4, and 5.
The function checks if 3*3 is equal to 4*4 + 5*5, which is false.
The function then checks if 4*4 is equal to 3*3 + 5*5, which is false.
The function then checks if 5*5 is equal to 3*3 + 4*4, which is true.

Therefore, the return value of the function is true.
