<<<Analysis>>>
The code first sorts the list of numbers in ascending order using the sorted() function.
The code then checks if the length of the list is odd or even using the % operator.
If the length is odd, the code returns the middle element of the list using the index [len(l) // 2].
If the length is even, the code calculates the average of the two middle elements and returns it.

In this case, the length of the list is 5, which is odd.
The middle element of the list is 3, which is returned as the median.
<<<Output>>>
3
