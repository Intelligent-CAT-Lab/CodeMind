<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string of brackets as input and checks if they are correctly nested.
The function first initializes a variable depth to 0.
It then iterates over each character in the input string and checks if it is an opening bracket (<).
If it is, it increments the depth by 1.
If it is not, it decrements the depth by 1.
The function then checks if the depth is less than 0, which would indicate an unbalanced bracket.
If it is, the function returns False.
If the depth is 0 at the end of the loop, the function returns True.

The input string is "10", which is not a string of brackets.
The function will iterate over each character in the string and increment the depth by 1, resulting in a depth of 2.
Since the depth is greater than 0 at the end of the loop, the function will return False.
<<<Output>>>
False
