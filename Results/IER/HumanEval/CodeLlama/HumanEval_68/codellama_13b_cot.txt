<<<Analysis>>>
The function pluck takes an array arr as input.
The function first checks if the length of the array is 0, if it is, it returns an empty array.
The function then uses the filter function to create a new array evens that contains only the even numbers from the original array.
The function then checks if the evens array is empty, if it is, it returns an empty array.
The function then returns an array with the minimum value of the evens array and the index of the minimum value in the original array.

In this case, the input array is [4,2,3], so the evens array will be [2].
The minimum value of the evens array is 2, and the index of 2 in the original array is 1.

Therefore, the return value of the function will be [2, 1].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 1]
