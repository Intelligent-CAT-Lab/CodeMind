<<<Analysis>>>
The function get_row takes two arguments: lst and x.
The lst argument is an empty list, and the x argument is 1.
The function first creates a list of tuples called coords, where each tuple contains two elements: the row index and the column index of the element in lst that is equal to x.
The function then sorts the coords list first by the column index in descending order, and then by the row index in ascending order.
Since the lst argument is an empty list, the coords list is also empty, and the function returns an empty list.
