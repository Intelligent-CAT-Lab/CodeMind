<<<Analysis>>>
The function is_equal_to_sum_even takes an integer n as input.
The function first checks if n is even by using the modulo operator (%).
If n is even, the function checks if n is greater than or equal to 8.
If both conditions are met, the function returns True.
If either condition is not met, the function returns False.

In this case, the input is 4.
4 is even, so the first condition is met.
4 is less than 8, so the second condition is not met.
Therefore, the function returns False.
<<<Output>>>
False
