<<<Analysis>>>
The function factorize takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its prime factors.
The function first imports the math module and initializes an empty list fact to store the prime factors.
The function then sets i to 2 and enters a while loop that iterates until i is greater than or equal to the square root of n plus 1.
In each iteration, the function checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it appends i to fact and divides n by i.
If n is not divisible by i, the function increments i by 1 and continues the loop.
After the loop finishes, the function checks if n is greater than 1. If it is, it appends n to fact.
Finally, the function returns the list fact.

Based on the analysis, the return value of factorize(2) would be [2].
<<<Output>>>
[2]
