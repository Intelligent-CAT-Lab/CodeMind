<<<Analysis>>>
The function incr_list takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with each element incremented by 1.
The code uses a list comprehension to create a new list with the incremented elements.
The list comprehension iterates over the input list l and for each element e, it adds 1 to it and stores the result in a new list.
The code then returns the new list.

<<<Output>>>
[6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
