The function is_prime takes an integer n as input.
The function first checks if n is less than 2, and if it is, it returns False.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5.
For each number k in this range, it checks if n is divisible by k. If it is, it returns False.
The loop finishes and the function returns True.
