<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes an integer argument n and returns a string.
The function uses the range function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to n (inclusive).
The sequence is then converted to a list of strings using the str function.
Finally, the join function is used to join the list of strings with spaces.

The return value of the function is a string containing the sequence of numbers from 0 to n (inclusive), separated by spaces.
