<<<Analysis>>>
The function string_xor takes two strings a and b as input.
The function xor is defined inside string_xor. It takes two characters i and j as input and returns '0' if i and j are the same, and '1' otherwise.
The function string_xor returns the result of applying the xor function to each pair of characters in a and b.

In this case, the input to string_xor is '111000' and '101010'.
The function xor is applied to each pair of characters in these strings, resulting in the following output:

1 ^ 1 = 0
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
0 ^ 0 = 0

The output of string_xor is therefore '101010'.
