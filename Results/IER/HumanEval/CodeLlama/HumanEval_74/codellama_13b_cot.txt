<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes two lists as input, lst1 and lst2.
The code first calculates the total length of the strings in lst1 and stores it in l1.
The code then calculates the total length of the strings in lst2 and stores it in l2.
The code then checks if l1 is less than or equal to l2. If it is, the function returns lst1. Otherwise, it returns lst2.
In this case, the length of the strings in lst1 is 2 (hi and admin), while the length of the strings in lst2 is 4 (hi and hi). Therefore, the function returns lst2.
<<<Output>>>
['hi', 'hi']
