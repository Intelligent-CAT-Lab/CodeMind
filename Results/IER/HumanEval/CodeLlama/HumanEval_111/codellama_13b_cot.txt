The variable test is initialized to 'a b b a'.
The code then splits the string into a list of words using the split() method.
The list is stored in the variable list1.
The code then initializes a dictionary called dict1 and sets its value to an empty dictionary.
The code then initializes a variable t to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list1.
For each word in the list, the code checks if the word is not empty and if the word appears more times in the list than the current value of t.
If the condition is met, the code updates the value of t to the number of times the word appears in the list.
The code then checks if t is greater than 0.
If it is, the code enters another loop that iterates over the list1.
For each word in the list, the code checks if the word appears the same number of times as the value of t.
If the condition is met, the code adds the word to the dictionary with the value of t.
The code then returns the dictionary.
<<<Output>>>
{'a': 2, 'b': 2}
