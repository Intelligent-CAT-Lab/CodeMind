  <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and checks if it contains nested brackets.
The function first initializes two lists, opening_bracket_index and closing_bracket_index, to store the indices of opening and closing brackets, respectively.
The function then iterates through the string and appends the indices of opening and closing brackets to their respective lists.
The function then reverses the closing_bracket_index list and initializes a counter variable cnt to 0.
The function then iterates through the opening_bracket_index list and checks if the current index is less than the corresponding closing bracket index in the reversed closing_bracket_index list. If it is, it increments the counter variable cnt and increments the index of the closing_bracket_index list.
The function returns True if cnt is greater than or equal to 2, indicating that the string contains at least two nested brackets.
