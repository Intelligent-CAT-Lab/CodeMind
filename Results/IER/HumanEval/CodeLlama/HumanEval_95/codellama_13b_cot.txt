  <<<Analysis>>>
The function check_dict_case takes a dictionary as an argument.
The function first checks if the dictionary is empty. If it is, it returns False.
If the dictionary is not empty, it sets the state variable to "start".
It then iterates over the keys of the dictionary using a for loop.
For each key, it checks if the key is a string. If it is not, it sets the state variable to "mixed" and breaks out of the loop.
If the state variable is "start", it checks if the key is uppercase or lowercase. If it is not, it sets the state variable to "mixed" and breaks out of the loop.
If the state variable is "upper" or "lower", it checks if the key is uppercase or lowercase. If it is not, it sets the state variable to "mixed" and breaks out of the loop.
If the state variable is "upper" or "lower" and the key is uppercase or lowercase, respectively, it does not change the state variable.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of the state variable.
