<<<Analysis>>>
The function get_positive takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the positive numbers in the input list.
The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and return a new list containing only the positive numbers.
The list comprehension is equivalent to the following code:
[e for e in l if e > 0]
This code iterates over the input list l and returns a new list containing only the elements e that satisfy the condition e > 0.
In this case, the input list is [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6], so the output list will contain only the positive numbers 4, 5, and 6.
<<<Output>>>
[4, 5, 6]
