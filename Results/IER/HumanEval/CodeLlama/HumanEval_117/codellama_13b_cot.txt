<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to "Mary had a little lamb", and variable n is initialized to 4.
The code then splits the string s into a list of words using the split() method.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each word in the list.
For each word, it calculates the number of consonants using the following logic:
It iterates over each character in the word using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if it is a consonant (i.e., it is not one of the vowels "a", "e", "i", "o", or "u").
If it is a consonant, it increments a counter called n_consonants.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the number of consonants in the current word is equal to the variable n.
If it is, the word is added to the list result.
The code then returns the list result.
<<<Output>>>
["lamb"]
