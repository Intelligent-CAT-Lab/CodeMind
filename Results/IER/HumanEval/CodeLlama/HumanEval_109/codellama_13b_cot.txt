  <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes an array as input.
The function checks if the length of the array is 0. If it is, it returns True.
The function then sorts the array and stores it in a variable called sorted_array.
The function then creates an empty array called my_arr.
The function then finds the minimum value in the array and stores it in a variable called min_value.
The function then finds the index of the minimum value in the array and stores it in a variable called min_index.
The function then creates a new array called my_arr by concatenating the elements of the original array from the minimum index to the end of the array with the elements of the original array from the beginning of the array to the minimum index.
The function then loops through the elements of the array and checks if each element is equal to the corresponding element in the sorted_array. If it is not, it returns False.
If the loop completes and all elements are equal, the function returns True.
