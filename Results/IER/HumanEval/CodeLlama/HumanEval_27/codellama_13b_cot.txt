The function flip_case takes a string as input and returns a new string with the case of all characters flipped.
The code uses the swapcase() method of the string object to achieve this.
The swapcase() method returns a new string with the case of all characters flipped.
In this case, the input string is 'Hello!', which has uppercase letters.
The swapcase() method will return a new string with the case of all characters flipped, which means the output string will have lowercase letters.
<<<Output>>>
'hello!'

The function greet takes a string as input and returns a new string with the greeting message.
The code uses the f-string syntax to create the output string.
The f-string syntax allows you to include variables in the string by using the {variable_name} syntax.
In this case, the input string is "Alice", which is included in the output string as {name}.
The output string is "Hello, Alice!".
