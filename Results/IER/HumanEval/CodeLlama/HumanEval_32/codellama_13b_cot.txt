  <<<Analysis>>>
The function `poly` takes two arguments: a list of coefficients `xs` and a float `x`. It returns the value of the polynomial equation represented by `xs` evaluated at `x`.
The function `find_zero` takes a single argument `x` and returns the value of the polynomial equation represented by `xs` evaluated at `x` when the function is equal to zero.
The code first initializes `begin` and `end` to -1 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that checks if the product of the values of the polynomial equation at `begin` and `end` is positive. If it is, it multiplies `begin` and `end` by 2 and repeats the check.
This loop is repeated until the product of the values of the polynomial equation at `begin` and `end` is negative.
The code then enters another loop that checks if the difference between `begin` and `end` is greater than 1e-10. If it is, it calculates the midpoint `center` between `begin` and `end`, and checks if the value of the polynomial equation at `center` is positive. If it is, it sets `begin` to `center`. Otherwise, it sets `end` to `center`.
This loop is repeated until the difference between `begin` and `end` is less than or equal to 1e-10.
The code then returns the value of `begin`.
