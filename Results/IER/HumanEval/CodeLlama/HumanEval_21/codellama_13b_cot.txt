<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of floating-point numbers as input.
The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the list using the min() and max() functions.
The function then returns a new list where each element is the original element minus the minimum value, divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

In this case, the input list is [2.0, 49.9].
The minimum value is 2.0, and the maximum value is 49.9.
The function returns [(2.0 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0), (49.9 - 2.0) / (49.9 - 2.0)] = [0.0, 1.0].

<<<Output>>>
[0.0, 1.0]
