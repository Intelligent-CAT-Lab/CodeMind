<<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a string as input and returns a new string with spaces replaced by underscores and consecutive spaces replaced by a single dash.
The function first initializes two variables, new_text and i, to empty strings and 0, respectively.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates over the characters in the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is a space. If it is, it increments the variable end by 1. Otherwise, it checks if the difference between end and start is greater than 2. If it is, it adds a dash to new_text and sets start and end to the current character's index plus 1. If the difference is greater than 0 but less than 2, it adds underscores to new_text and sets start and end to the current character's index plus 1. Otherwise, it adds the current character to new_text and sets start and end to the current character's index plus 1.
After the loop finishes, the function checks if the difference between end and start is greater than 2. If it is, it adds a dash to new_text. Otherwise, it adds underscores.
The function then returns the new_text variable.
