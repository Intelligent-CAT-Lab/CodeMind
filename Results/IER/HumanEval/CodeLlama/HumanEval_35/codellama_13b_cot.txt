The function takes a list of integers as input.
The function initializes a variable m to the first element of the list, which is 1.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the remaining elements of the list.
For each element e in the list, the function checks if e is greater than m. If it is, it updates m to e.
The loop finishes when all elements have been processed.
The function then returns the final value of m, which is 3.
