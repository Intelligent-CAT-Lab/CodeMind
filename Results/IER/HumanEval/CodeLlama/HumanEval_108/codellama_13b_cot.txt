<<<Analysis>>>
The function count_nums takes an array of integers as input.
The function digits_sum takes an integer as input and returns the sum of its digits.
The function count_nums first filters the array of integers to only include positive numbers.
It then applies the digits_sum function to each number in the array and returns the length of the resulting array.

In this case, the input array is [1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5].
The function filters the array to only include positive numbers, resulting in [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
It then applies the digits_sum function to each number in the array, resulting in [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The length of the resulting array is 6, so the function returns 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
