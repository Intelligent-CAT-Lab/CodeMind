<<<Analysis>>>
The function largest_divisor takes an integer n as input and returns the largest divisor of n.
The function starts by iterating over the range of numbers from n to 1 in reverse order using the reversed() function.
For each number i in this range, the function checks if n is divisible by i using the modulo operator (%).
If n is divisible by i, the function returns i as the largest divisor.
If no divisor is found, the function returns 1 as the largest divisor.
