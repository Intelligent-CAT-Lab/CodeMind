  <<<Analysis>>>
The function takes a list of floating-point numbers as input.
The function iterates over the list of numbers using two nested for loops.
The outer loop iterates over the list of numbers using enumerate() function.
The inner loop iterates over the list of numbers using enumerate() function.
The function calculates the absolute difference between two numbers and stores it in a variable called distance.
The function checks if the distance is less than the current distance.
If the distance is less than the current distance, the function updates the distance and the closest pair of numbers.
The function returns the closest pair of numbers.

<<<Output>>>
(2.2, 3.9)
