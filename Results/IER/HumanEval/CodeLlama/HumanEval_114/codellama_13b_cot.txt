  <<<Analysis>>>
The function minSubArraySum takes an array of integers as input.
The code first initializes two variables, max_sum and s, to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the input array.
For each element num in the array, the code adds -num to s.
If s is less than 0, the code sets s to 0.
The code then updates max_sum to the maximum of s and max_sum.
The code then checks if max_sum is 0. If it is, the code sets max_sum to the maximum of -i for each element i in the input array.
The code then sets min_sum to -max_sum.
The code then returns min_sum.

<<<Output>>>
-10
