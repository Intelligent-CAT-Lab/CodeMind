<<<Analysis>>>
The function modp takes two integer arguments n and p.
The function first initializes a variable ret to 1.
The function then enters a loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, the function multiplies ret by 2 and takes the modulo of p.
The loop finishes when n iterations have been completed.
The function then returns the final value of ret.

Based on the analysis, the return value of modp(3, 5) would be 1.
<<<Output>>>
