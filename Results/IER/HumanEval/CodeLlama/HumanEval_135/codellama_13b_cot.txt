<<<Analysis>>>
The function can_arrange takes an array arr as input.
The function first initializes two variables, ind and i, to -1 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates from 1 to the length of the array (exclusive), meaning it will consider elements from 1 to 4.
For each element i in this range, the code checks if the current element is less than the previous element. If it is, the code sets ind to i and breaks out of the loop.
The code then returns the final value of ind, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
