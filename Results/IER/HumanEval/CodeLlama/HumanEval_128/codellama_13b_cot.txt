<<<Analysis>>>
The function prod_signs takes an array arr as input.
The function first checks if the array is empty, if it is, it returns None.
The function then calculates the product of the signs of the elements in the array.
The product of the signs is calculated by taking the length of the list of negative elements in the array.
If there are no negative elements, the product is 0.
If there are negative elements, the product is (-1) ** len(negative elements).
The function then returns the product of the signs multiplied by the sum of the absolute values of the elements in the array.

<<<Output>>>
-8
