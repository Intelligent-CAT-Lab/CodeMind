The code first reads the input from the user and stores it in a variable called "n".
Then it initializes an array called "a" with size "n" and initializes it with random numbers between 2 and 5000.
Then it initializes a set called "have" to store the random numbers.
Then it enters a while loop that runs until the condition is met.
Inside the while loop, it initializes two arrays called "plus" and "minus" with size "n+n" and initializes them with random numbers between 2 and 5000.
Then it checks if the random numbers in "plus" and "minus" are already in the set "have".
If they are not, it adds them to the set "have" and assigns them to the corresponding indices in "plus" and "minus".
Then it initializes a 2D array called "a" with size "n" and initializes it with random numbers between 2 and 5000.
Then it enters another while loop that runs until the condition is met.
Inside the while loop, it initializes a variable called "got" with the product of the corresponding indices in "plus" and "minus".
Then it checks if the product of the corresponding indices in "plus" and "minus" is already in the set "have".
If it is not, it adds it to the set "have" and assigns it to the corresponding indices in "a".
Then it checks if the sum of the corresponding indices in "plus" and "minus" is already in the set "have".
If it is not, it adds it to the set "have" and assigns it to the corresponding indices in "a".
Then it checks if the difference of the corresponding indices in "plus" and "minus" is already in the set "have".
If it is not, it adds it to the set "have" and assigns it to the corresponding indices in "a".
Then it checks if the product of the corresponding indices in "plus" and "minus" is already in the set "have".
If it is not, it adds it to the set "have" and assigns it to the corresponding indices in "a".
