NO-ANSWER
  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates an array of integers called mem with a size of 10. It also creates a variable called pos with an initial value of 0.
It then creates a StringBuilder object called sb.
The code then reads a line of input from the user using the scanner object sc.
It then converts the input to a character array using the toCharArray() method.
It then iterates over each character in the character array using a for-each loop.
For each character, it calculates the index of the character in the mem array using the formula (c - 33) / 10.
It then calculates the difference between the current index and the previous index and appends the appropriate number of '<' or '>' characters to the StringBuilder object sb.
It then updates the value of pos to the current index.
It then calculates the difference between the current character and the previous character in the mem array and appends the appropriate number of '-' or '+' characters to the StringBuilder object sb.
It then updates the value of the current character in the mem array to the current character.
It then appends a '.' character to the StringBuilder object sb.
Finally, it prints the contents of the StringBuilder object sb.
