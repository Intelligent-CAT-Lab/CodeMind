The code first creates a FastScanner object called sc.
Then it reads the input string from the user and stores it in a char array called strz.
It then initializes a variable min to 100.
It then enters a for loop that iterates 26 times.
Inside the for loop, it initializes a variable key to the current character in the alphabet.
It then initializes a variable cnt to 0.
It then creates a new char array called str and copies the contents of strz into it.
It then enters a while loop that iterates until the condition is met.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current character in the string is not equal to the current character in the alphabet.
If it is not equal, it sets a flag to true and breaks out of the loop.
If the flag is false, it prints the current character in the alphabet and the value of cnt.
If the value of cnt is less than the value of min, it sets min to the value of cnt.
It then increments cnt by 1.
It then creates a new char array called next and copies the contents of str into it.
It then checks if the length of next is 1.
If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
It then sets the current character in the string to the current character in the alphabet.
