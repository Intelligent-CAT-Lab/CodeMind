The code takes in an integer n as input and then creates an array f of size n+1 and an array suffix of size n+1.
It then initializes the first element of f and suffix to n and the remaining elements to -1.
It then creates a new instance of the class TaskC and calls its solve method with the input n, a new instance of the class FastInput, and a new instance of the class FastOutput.
The solve method of TaskC takes in an integer testNumber, an instance of the class FastInput, and an instance of the class FastOutput.
It then initializes the variable n to the input n and creates two arrays f and suffix of size n+1.
It then initializes the first element of f and suffix to n and the remaining elements to -1.
It then creates a new instance of the class NumberTheory.Modular and initializes it to 1e9 + 7.
