The input is a string of 18 digits. The code first converts the input string to a character array using the toCharArray() method.
It then initializes an integer array d with the length of the character array + 1.
It initializes an integer variable cur with the value 1.
It initializes a long variable ans with the value 0.
It initializes an integer array f with the length of 2019.
It sets the value of f[0] to 1.
It then enters a for loop that iterates from the length of the character array - 1 to 0.
Inside the for loop, it assigns the value of the character array at the current index to a variable c.
It then assigns the value of the character array at the current index + 1 to a variable d[i].
