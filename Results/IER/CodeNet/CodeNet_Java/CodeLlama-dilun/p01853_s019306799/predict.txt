NO-ANSWER
  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 100 respectively according to the input.
The code checks if the variable n is odd or even. If it is odd, it calculates the value of fst and snd as n / 2 + 1 and n / 2 respectively.
It then enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to fst - 1 to print 0.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to snd - 1 to print m.
It then prints a newline character.
If the variable n is even, it calculates the value of fst as n / 2.
It then enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to fst to print 0.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to fst - 1 to print m.
It then prints a newline character.
