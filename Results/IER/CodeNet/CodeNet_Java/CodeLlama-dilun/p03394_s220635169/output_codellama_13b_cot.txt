NO-ANSWER
  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input from the console and stores it in a variable called "n".
Then it checks if the value of "n" is equal to 3. If it is, it prints "2 5 63" and exits the program.
If "n" is not equal to 3, it initializes a new Random object with a seed of 0.
It then initializes an array called "ans" with the value of "n".
It then initializes a TreeSet called "used" and adds the value 1 to it.
It then enters a while loop that continues until the value of "ans" is not equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it initializes a variable called "g0" with the value of 2*3*5*7*11*13.
It then initializes a variable called "sum" with the value of 0.
It then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to "n-1".
