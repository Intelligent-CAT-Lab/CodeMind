The code first initializes the variables n, K, and m with the values 3 and 1, respectively. It then initializes the arrays vis, canPair, and A with the values 0, false, and 0, respectively.

The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to n + 1. Inside the loop, it checks if the current value of i is less than or equal to n and if the value of vis[i] is false. If both conditions are true, it sets the value of vis[i] to true and sets the value of A[m] to i. It then increments m by 1.

The code then checks if the current value of i is less than or equal to n and if the value of vis[i] is false. If both conditions are true, it sets the value of vis[i] to true and sets the value of A[m] to i + n. It then increments m by 1.
