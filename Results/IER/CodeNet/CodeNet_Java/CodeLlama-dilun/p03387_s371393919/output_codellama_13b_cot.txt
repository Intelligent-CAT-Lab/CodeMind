NO-ANSWER
  <<<Analysis>>>
The input is read into an array of integers called input.
The array is then sorted using the Arrays.sort() method.
The array is then iterated over and each element is subtracted from the largest element in the array.
The result is then checked to see if it is equal to 0.
If it is, then nothing is done.
If it is not, then the code checks to see if the first two elements are equal.
If they are, then the first element is added to the answer.
If they are not, then the code checks to see if the first element is even.
If it is, then the first element is decremented and added to the answer.
If it is not, then the code checks to see if the second element is even.
If it is, then the second element is decremented and added to the answer.
If it is not, then the code checks to see if the third element is even.
If it is, then the third element is decremented and added to the answer.
