The code first creates an instance of the Kattio class, which is a custom class for reading input from the console. It then creates an instance of the Solve class, which is the main class for the program.

The Solve class has a main method that takes an instance of the Kattio class as an argument. It then reads an integer n from the input stream using the getInt method of the Kattio class.

The Solve class then creates an instance of the PrimeGenerator class, which is used to generate prime numbers. It then creates a 2D array a of size n+2 x n+2, and initializes it to 1.

The Solve class then creates two arrays d1 and d2 of size 2n+3, and initializes them to the next prime number using the nextPrime method of the PrimeGenerator class.

The Solve class then iterates over the rows and columns of the 2D array a, and sets the value of each element to the product of the corresponding elements in the d1 and d2 arrays, if the row and column indices are even.

The Solve class then iterates over the rows and columns of the 2D array a, and sets the value of each element to 1 if the row and column indices are odd.

The Solve class then iterates over the rows and columns of the 2D array a, and sets the value of each element to the least common multiple of the corresponding elements in the d1 and d2 arrays, if the row and column indices are even.

The Solve class then iterates over the rows and columns of the 2D array a, and sets the value of each element to the least common multiple of the corresponding elements in the d1 and d2 arrays, if the row and column indices are odd.
