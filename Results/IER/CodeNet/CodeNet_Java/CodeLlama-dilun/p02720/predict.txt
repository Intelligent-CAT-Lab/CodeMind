The output of the code will be the value of val after the while loop has finished executing. Since the LinkedList starts with the numbers 1 to 9, and the while loop adds and removes elements from the LinkedList, the final value of val will be the last element in the LinkedList, which is 9.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:
9
