The code first reads the input string from the user and stores it in a variable str.
It then creates an empty ArrayList list and a Scanner object scanner to read the input.
It then iterates through the string str and checks each character at position i.
If the character is 'I', it adds the string "I" to the ArrayList list.
If the character is 'O', it adds the string "O" to the ArrayList list.
If the character is 'J', it adds the string "J" to the ArrayList list.
It then checks if the current character is the same as the next character. If it is, it increments a counter variable cnt.
It then adds the current character to the ArrayList list and sets the counter variable cnt to 1.
It then checks if the current character is the last character in the string. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
It then adds the current character to the ArrayList list and sets the counter variable cnt to 1.
