The input string is "011".
The code first calls the doit() method with the input string and an empty cache.
The doit() method then calls itself recursively with the substring of the input string starting from the second character, which is "11".
The substring "11" is then passed to the doit() method again, which calls itself recursively with the substring "1", which is then passed to the doit() method again, which calls itself recursively with the empty string, which returns 1.
