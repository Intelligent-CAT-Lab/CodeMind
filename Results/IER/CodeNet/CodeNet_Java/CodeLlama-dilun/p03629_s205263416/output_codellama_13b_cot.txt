The code first creates a new thread with a null runnable, a priority of 1 << 29, and a name of "".
It then starts the thread and joins it, which means that the main thread will wait for the new thread to finish.
The new thread creates a FastInput object with System.in as the input stream, and a FastOutput object with System.out as the output stream.
It then creates an EDontBeASubsequence object and calls its solve method with 1 as the test number, the FastInput object, and the FastOutput object.
The solve method first reads a string from the FastInput object and stores it in an array of integers called s.
It then initializes an array of arrays of integers called next with the size of the alphabet (26) and the length of the string + 2.
It then subtracts 'a' from each element of the string to convert it to a numerical representation.
It then initializes an array of integers called dp with the length of the string + 2 and sets the last element to 0.
It then iterates through the string backwards and for each element i, it sets the next element to the next element in the string and sets the current element to the next element in the string.
It then sets the last element of the next array to the length of the string + 1.
It then iterates through the string backwards and for each element i, it sets the next element to the next element in the string and sets the current element to the next element in the string.
It then sets the last element of the next array to the length of the string + 1.
