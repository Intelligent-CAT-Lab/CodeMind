The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters the f function and it checks if the value of n is 0. If it is, it returns 2.
If n is not 0, it calls the f function recursively with n-1 as the argument.
It then multiplies the result of the recursive call by 2 and adds 2 to it.
The function returns the result of the multiplication and addition.
