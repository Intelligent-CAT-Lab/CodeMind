The code first initializes the variables N and M with 2 and 0 respectively.
Then it initializes an array a with size N and fills it with 0.
It then initializes a boolean array b with size N*2-1 and fills it with true.
It then iterates through the array a and sets the corresponding index in b to false if the value at that index is not 0.
It then iterates through the array b and sets the corresponding index in b to true if the value at that index is true and the previous index is also true.
It then iterates through the array b and sets the corresponding index in b to true if the value at that index is true or the previous index is also true.
