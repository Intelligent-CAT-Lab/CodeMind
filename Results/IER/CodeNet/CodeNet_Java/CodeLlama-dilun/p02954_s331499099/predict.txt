NO-ANSWER
  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It then reads a string S from the user and stores it in a variable.
It then initializes an ArrayList Sa to store the substrings of S that start with "RL".
It then iterates through the characters of S and checks if the current character is 'R' and the next character is 'L'. If it is, it adds the substring starting from the current character to the end of the substring to Sa.
It then iterates through the elements of Sa and checks if the length of the substring is even or odd. If it is even, it prints 0 for all the characters of the substring. If it is odd, it prints the length of the substring divided by 2 for the first character, the length of the substring divided by 2 + 1 for the second character, and 0 for all the remaining characters.
