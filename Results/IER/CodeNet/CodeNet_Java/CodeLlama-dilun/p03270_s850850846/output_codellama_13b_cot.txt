NO-ANSWER
  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables K and N with the values 3 and 3 respectively.
Then it creates an instance of the FermatCombination class with the parameters 4010, 998244353.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to 2*K+1.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of the variable i and checks if it is less than or equal to K+1.
If it is, it calculates the value of the variable g as i/2.
If it is not, it calculates the value of the variable g as (2*(K+1) - i)/2.
Then it checks if the value of i is even.
If it is, it calculates the value of the variable r as K-(g-1)*2-1.
If it is not, it calculates the value of the variable r as K-g*2.
Then it calculates the value of the variable ret as the result of the function f(N, r, g).
If the value of i is greater than K+1, it calculates the value of the variable ret as the result of the function f(N-1, r, g).
Finally, it adds the value of ret to the array ans at the index i.
After the loop finishes, it prints the values of the array ans to the console.
