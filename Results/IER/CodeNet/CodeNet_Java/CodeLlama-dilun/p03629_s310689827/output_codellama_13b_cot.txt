The code first reads the input from the console and stores it in a variable called "INPUT".
Then it creates a new instance of the Main class and calls the run() method on it.
The run() method creates a new PrintWriter object and assigns it to the out variable.
It then creates a new InputStreamReader object and assigns it to the is variable.
It then creates a new BufferedReader object and assigns it to the br variable.
It then reads the first line of input from the console using the readLine() method of the BufferedReader object.
It then splits the line into an array of strings using the split() method of the String class.
It then initializes the variable n with the length of the array.
It then initializes the variable c with the first element of the array.
It then initializes the variable count with a new array of integers with length 26.
It then initializes the variable e with a new array of booleans with length n.
It then enters a for loop that iterates from n-1 to 0.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the variable a with the value of the current element of the array c minus the ASCII value of the character 'a'.
It then increments the value of the element at index a in the count array.
It then initializes the variable flag with the value of true.
It then enters a nested for loop that iterates from 0 to 25.
Inside the nested for loop, it checks if the value of the element at index j in the count array is equal to 0.
If it is, it sets the value of the variable flag to false.
It then checks if the value of the variable flag is true.
If it is, it sets the value of the element at index j in the e array to true.
It then sets the value of the element at index j in the count array to 0.
It then checks if the value of the variable flag is false.
If it is, it sets the value of the element at index j in the count array to 0.
It then sets the value of the variable flag to true.
It then enters a nested for loop that iterates from 0 to 25.
