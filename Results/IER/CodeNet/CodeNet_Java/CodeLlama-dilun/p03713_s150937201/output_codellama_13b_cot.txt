The variable h and variable w are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable w1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable w is greater than or equal to 3. If it is, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable w2.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable w3 by dividing the value of variable w by 2 and rounding down.
Then it calculates the value of variable h1 by multiplying the value of variable h by the value of variable w1.
Then it calculates the value of variable h2 by multiplying the value of variable h by the value of variable w2.
Then it calculates the value of variable h3 by multiplying the value of variable h by the value of variable w3.
Then it calls the method calc with the values of variable h1, variable h2 and variable h3 as arguments.
The method calc calculates the maximum and minimum values of the three arguments and returns the difference between them.
