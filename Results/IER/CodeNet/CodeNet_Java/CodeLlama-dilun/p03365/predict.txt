  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the input stream and output stream.
Then it creates an instance of the MyScan class, which is a custom class for reading input.
It then creates an instance of the TaskC class, which is the main class for the solution.
It then calls the solve method of the TaskC class with the input stream, output stream, and the test number.
The solve method first reads an integer from the input stream using the nextInt method of the MyScan class.
It then initializes an array of longs with the size of the integer read.
It then enters a while loop that iterates from the integer read minus 2 to 0.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of the current index of the array using the c method of the Util class.
It then updates the value of the current index of the array with the calculated value.
