NO-ANSWER
  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the Scanner object sc to read input from the console.
It then reads four integers sx, sy, tx, and ty from the input using the sc.nextInt() method.
The sc.close() method is called to close the scanner object.

The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to tx-sx.
Inside the loop, it prints "R" to the console.

The code then enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to ty-sy.
Inside the loop, it prints "U" to the console.

The code then enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to tx-sx.
Inside the loop, it prints "L" to the console.

The code then enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to ty-sy.
Inside the loop, it prints "D" to the console.

The code then prints "D" to the console.

The code then enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to tx-sx+1.
Inside the loop, it prints "R" to the console.

The code then enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to ty-sy+1.
Inside the loop, it prints "U" to the console.

The code then prints "L" to the console.

The code then enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to tx-sx+1.
Inside the loop, it prints "L" to the console.

The code then enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to ty-sy+1.
Inside the loop, it prints "D" to the console.

The code then prints "R" to the console.
