The input string is "xabxa".
The code first converts the input string to a character array.
Then it creates a list of characters that are not 'x'.
If the list is empty, it prints "0" and returns.
If the list contains only one character, it prints "-1" and returns.
If the list contains more than one character, it checks if the first and last characters are the same. If they are not, it prints "-1" and returns.
If the first and last characters are the same, it checks if the string is a palindrome. If it is, it prints "0" and returns.
If the string is not a palindrome, it checks if the first and last characters are the same. If they are, it prints "1" and returns.
If the first and last characters are not the same, it checks if the string is a palindrome. If it is, it prints "1" and returns.
If the string is not a palindrome, it checks if the first and last characters are the same. If they are, it prints "2" and returns.
If the first and last characters are not the same, it checks if the string is a palindrome. If it is, it prints "2" and returns.
If the string is not a palindrome, it checks if the first and last characters are the same. If they are, it prints "3" and returns.
If the first and last characters are not the same, it checks if the string is a palindrome. If it is, it prints "3" and returns.
If the string is not a palindrome, it checks if the first and last characters are the same. If they are, it prints "4" and returns.
If the first and last characters are not the same, it checks if the string is a palindrome. If it is, it prints "4" and returns.
