The code first reads the input from the file "input.txt" and stores it in the variable "input".
Then it creates a new instance of the class "Kattio" and passes the "input" variable to its constructor.
The "Kattio" class is used to read input from the file "input.txt" and write output to the file "output.txt".
The code then creates a new instance of the class "Solve" and passes the "io" variable to its constructor.
The "Solve" class is used to solve the problem and its constructor initializes the variables "n", "k", "a", "b", "f", "dp", and "memoWaysToPair".
The code then calls the "main" method of the "Solve" class.
The "main" method first reads the values of "n" and "k" from the input file.
Then it initializes the arrays "a", "b", and "f".
The "main" method then calls the "waysToPair" method to calculate the number of ways to pair the elements in the array "a" and "b".
The "waysToPair" method calculates the number of ways to pair the elements in the array "a" and "b" using the formula (n-1)!/(2!(n-2)!) where n is the number of elements in the array.
The "main" method then calculates the number of ways to pair the elements in the array "a" and "b" using the formula (n-1)!/(2!(n-2)!) where n is the number of elements in the array.
The "main" method then calculates the number of ways to pair the elements in the array "a" and "b" using the formula (n-1)!/(2!(n-2)!) where n is the number of elements in the array.
