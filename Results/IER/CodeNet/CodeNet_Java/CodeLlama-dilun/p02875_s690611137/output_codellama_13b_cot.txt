The code first initializes the input stream and output stream.
Then it creates an instance of the InputReader class and passes the input stream to it.
The InputReader class has a method called next() which returns the next token in the input stream.
The InputReader class also has a method called nextInt() which returns the next integer in the input stream.
The code then creates an instance of the TaskC class and passes the input stream and output stream to it.
The TaskC class has a method called solve() which takes the input stream and output stream as arguments.
The solve() method first reads the input from the input stream using the nextInt() method and stores it in a variable called n.
Then it calculates the result using the formula (3^n) % 998244353.
The result is stored in a variable called res.
The solve() method then calculates the result using the formula (3^n) % 998244353.
The result is stored in a variable called res.
