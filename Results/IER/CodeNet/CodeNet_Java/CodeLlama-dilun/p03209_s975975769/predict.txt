The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable x is initialized with 7 according to the input.
The variable layer is initialized with an array of length n and the first element is set to 1.
The for loop iterates from 1 to n-1 and sets each element of the array layer to the previous element multiplied by 2 plus 3.
The function pati is called with the arguments n and x.
The function pati checks if n is 0, if it is, it returns 1.
If x is less than or equal to 1, it returns 0.
If x is less than or equal to 1+layer[n-1], it calls the function pati with the arguments n-1 and x-1.
If layer[n-1]+2 is equal to x, it returns pati(n-1,x-2)+1.
If x is less than 2*layer[n-1]+2, it returns pati(n-1,layer[n-1])+1+pati(n-1,x-1-layer[n-1]-1).
If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 2*pati(n-1,layer[n-1])+1.
