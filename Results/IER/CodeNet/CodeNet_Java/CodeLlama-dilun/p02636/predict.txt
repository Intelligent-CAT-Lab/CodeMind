The code first initializes the variables dyn1, dyn2, and ans with default values.
Then it reads the input string s from the console.
The length of the input string is stored in the variable n.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current index i is equal to 0.
If it is, it sets the value of dyn1[i][j][k] to true.
If it is not, it checks if the current index i is less than n-1.
If it is, it sets the value of dyn1[i+1][j][k] to true.
It then checks if the current index i is greater than 0 and the character at index i-1 is equal to '1'.
If it is, it sets the value of dyn1[i-1][j][k+1] to true.
It then checks if the current index i is greater than 0 and the character at index i-1 is equal to '0'.
If it is, it sets the value of dyn1[i-1][j+1][k] to true.
