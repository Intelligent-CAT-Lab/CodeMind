The code first creates an instance of the FastScanner class and assigns it to the variable sc.
Then it reads two integers from the input using the nextInt() method of the FastScanner class.
The first integer is assigned to the variable n and the second integer is assigned to the variable m.
The code then checks if the value of n is even or odd using the modulo operator.
If n is even, the code prints 0 followed by n/2 spaces and then n/2 + 1 to n spaces with the value of m.
If n is odd, the code prints 0 followed by n/2 spaces and then n/2 + 1 to n spaces with the value of m.
Finally, the code prints a newline character.
