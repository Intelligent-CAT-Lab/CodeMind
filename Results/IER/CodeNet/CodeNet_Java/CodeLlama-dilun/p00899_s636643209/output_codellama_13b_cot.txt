The code first reads an integer n from the standard input.
Then it reads n strings from the standard input and stores them in an array of strings.
The code then initializes a bitmask variable bit with the value (1 << n) - 1.
The code then initializes an array of booleans unvalid with n elements, all set to false.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates over the elements of the array of strings.
For each element i of the array of strings, the code checks if the bit corresponding to i in the bitmask is set to 1.
If it is, the code sets the bit corresponding to i in the bitmask to 0 and sets the boolean at index i in the array unvalid to true.
The code then enters another while loop that iterates over the elements of the array of strings.
For each element j of the array of strings, the code checks if the bit corresponding to j in the bitmask is set to 1.
If it is, the code sets the bit corresponding to j in the bitmask to 0 and sets the boolean at index j in the array unvalid to true.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates over the elements of the array of strings.
For each element k of the array of strings, the code checks if the length of the string at index k is less than or equal to the length of the string at index j.
If it is, the code sets the bit corresponding to k in the bitmask to 0 and sets the boolean at index k in the array unvalid to true.
