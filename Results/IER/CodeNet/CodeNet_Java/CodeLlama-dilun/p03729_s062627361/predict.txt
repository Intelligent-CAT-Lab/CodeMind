The code first creates an instance of the MyScanner class and assigns it to the variable scanner.
The scanner class has three methods: next(), nextInt(), and nextDouble().
The next() method reads a line of input from the console and splits it into an array of strings using the space character as a delimiter.
The nextInt() method reads the next integer from the input stream.
The nextDouble() method reads the next double from the input stream.
The code then calls the solve() method, which takes an array of strings as an argument.
The solve() method creates an instance of the MyScanner class and assigns it to the variable scanner.
The solve() method then calls the next() method of the scanner to read the first line of input, which is "rng gorilla apple".
