The variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input.
It enters the loop function and checks if the condition n > 0 && n < 4 is met. It is not met, so it enters the else block.
Inside the else block, it checks if the condition n % 3 == 0 is met. It is not met, so it enters the else block again.
Inside the else block, it calculates the value of r with the formula r = loop(n / 3 + 1) + 1.
It then returns the value of r.
The function loop is called again with the value of n / 3 + 1, which is 3.
It enters the loop function and checks if the condition n > 0 && n < 4 is met. It is not met, so it enters the else block.
Inside the else block, it checks if the condition n % 3 == 0 is met. It is not met, so it enters the else block again.
Inside the else block, it calculates the value of r with the formula r = loop(n / 3 + 1) + 1.
It then returns the value of r.
The function loop is called again with the value of n / 3 + 1, which is 1.
It enters the loop function and checks if the condition n > 0 && n < 4 is met. It is met, so it returns 1.
The function loop is called again with the value of n / 3, which is 2.
It enters the loop function and checks if the condition n > 0 && n < 4 is met. It is not met, so it enters the else block.
