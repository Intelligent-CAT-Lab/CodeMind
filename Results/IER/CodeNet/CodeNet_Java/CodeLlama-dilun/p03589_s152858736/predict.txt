The output of the code will depend on the input provided by the user. If the user enters "2" as the input, the output will be:

1 1 2

This is because the method "solve" returns an array of integers, where the first element is the height of the rectangle, the second element is the width of the rectangle, and the third element is the area of the rectangle. In this case, the height and width of the rectangle are both 1, and the area is 2.
