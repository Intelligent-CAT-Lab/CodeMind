The input is a string of length 2.
The code first converts the input string to a char array using the toCharArray() method.
It then initializes two variables r and b to 0.
It then initializes a 2D array dp of size n+1 x n+1, where n is the length of the input string.
It initializes the first row of dp to 1.
It then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 0, 1 or 2.
If the current character is 0, it increments r by 2.
If the current character is 1, it increments r by 1 and b by 1.
If the current character is 2, it increments b by 2.
It then enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to i.
Inside this loop, it checks if the current character is 0, 1 or 2.
