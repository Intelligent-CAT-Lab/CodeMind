NO-ANSWER
  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input from the user and stores it in the variables n and k.
Then it checks if k is equal to 1, if it is, it prints 1 as the output and returns.
If k is not equal to 1, it initializes an array of longs called invs with k+1 elements.
It then initializes an array of longs called sufProds with k-1 elements.
It then initializes an array of longs called ways with 1 element.
