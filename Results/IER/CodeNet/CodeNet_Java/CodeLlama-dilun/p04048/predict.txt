The code first reads the input from the console and stores it in the variable INPUT.
Then it calls the solver() method which takes the input as arguments.
The solver() method first reads the input from the console and stores it in the variable INPUT.
Then it calls the nl() method which reads the input from the console and stores it in the variable num.
Then it checks if the variable num is equal to the variable n - x.
If it is, it calculates the sum as 3*x and prints it.
If it is not, it checks if the variable num is greater than the variable n - x.
If it is, it calculates the sum as x + n - x and prints it.
If it is not, it calculates the sum as x + n - x and prints it.
Then it calls the calc() method which takes the input as arguments.
The calc() method first reads the input from the console and stores it in the variable x.
Then it checks if the variable x is equal to the variable y.
If it is, it calculates the sum as y and prints it.
If it is not, it calculates the sum as y and prints it.
Then it calls the nl() method which reads the input from the console and stores it in the variable num.
Then it checks if the variable num is equal to the variable n - x.
