Instruction: I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Stack;

public class Main {
	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[] mem = new int[10];
		int pos = 0;
		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
		for (char c : sc.next().toCharArray()) {
			int idx = (c - 33) / 10;
			for (int i = 0; i < Math.abs(pos - idx); ++i) {
				sb.append(idx < pos? '<' : '>');
			}
			pos = idx;
			for (int i = 0; i < Math.abs(mem[pos] - c); ++i) {
				sb.append(c < mem[pos]? '-' : '+');
			}
			mem[pos] = c;
			sb.append('.');
		}
		System.out.println(sb);
	}

}
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
ABC

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable `mem` is initialized with an array of 10 elements. The variable `pos` is initialized with 0. The variable `sb` is initialized with an empty string.
The input is read and it is converted to a character array.
The for loop iterates over the character array and it assigns the value of each character to variable `c`.
The value of variable `c` is divided by 10 and the quotient is assigned to variable `idx`.
The for loop iterates from 0 to the absolute value of the difference between `pos` and `idx`.
The for loop iterates from 0 to the absolute value of the difference between the value of `mem[pos]` and `c`.
The value of `mem[pos]` is assigned to `c`.
The value of `c` is appended to `sb`.
The value of `sb` is printed as output.

The output of code execution is:
<.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+.<.<.>+
