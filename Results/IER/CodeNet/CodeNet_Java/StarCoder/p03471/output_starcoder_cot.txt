Instruction: I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int X = sc.nextInt();
		int Y = sc.nextInt();

		int sum=0;
		boolean judge=false;
		int a=0;
		int b=0;
		int c=0;

		for (int i=0; i<X+1; i++) {
			for (int k=0; k<X-i+1; k++) {
				sum = 10000*i + 5000*k + 1000*(X-i-k);
				if (sum==Y) {
					judge = true;
					a=i;
					b=k;
					c=X-i-k;
					break;
				}
			}
		}
		if (judge) {
			System.out.print(a);
			System.out.print(" ");
			System.out.print(b);
			System.out.print(" ");
			System.out.print(c);

		} else {
			System.out.println("-1 -1 -1");
		}

	}

}
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
9 45000

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable `X` and variable `Y` are initialized with 9 and 45000, respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9-i+1 to check each integer `k` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `sum` is calculated by the following formula:
10000*i + 5000*k + 1000*(X-i-k)
If the value of variable `sum` is equal to the value of variable `Y`, it sets the value of variable `judge` to true and it sets the value of variables `a`, `b` and `c` to the values of `i`, `k` and `X-i-k`, respectively.
When the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable `judge` is true. If it is true, it prints the values of variables `a`, `b` and `c` as output, which is 9 1 0.
If it is false, it prints -1 -1 -1 as output.

The output of code execution is:
9 1 0
