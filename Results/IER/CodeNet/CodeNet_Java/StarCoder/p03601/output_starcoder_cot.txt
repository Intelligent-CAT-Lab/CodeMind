Instruction: I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);) {
            new Main().solve(sc);
        }
    }

    void solve(Scanner sc) {
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int d = sc.nextInt();
        int e = sc.nextInt();
        int f = sc.nextInt();

        int waterX = 0;
        int ansWater = 100;
        int ansSugar = 0;
        while (100 * a * waterX <= f) {
            int waterY = 0;
            while (100 * a * waterX + 100 * b * waterY <= f) {
                int water = 100 * a * waterX + 100 * b * waterY;
                int sugarX = 0;
                while (water + c * sugarX <= f) {
                    int sugarY = 0;
                    while (water + c * sugarX + d * sugarY <= f) {
                        int sugar = c * sugarX + d * sugarY;
                        if (sugar * (100 + e) <= e * (water + sugar)) {
                            if (sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar)) {
                                ansWater = water;
                                ansSugar = sugar;
                            }
                        }
                        sugarY++;
                    }
                    sugarX++;
                }
                waterY++;
            }
            waterX++;
        }

        System.out.println(ansWater + ansSugar + " " + ansSugar);
    }
}
