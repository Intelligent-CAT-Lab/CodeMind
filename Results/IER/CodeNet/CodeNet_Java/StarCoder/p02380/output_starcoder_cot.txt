Instruction: I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

public class Main{
  public void run(java.io.InputStream in, java.io.PrintStream out){
    java.util.Scanner sc = new java.util.Scanner(in);
/*answer*/
    double a, b, cc;
    double s, l, h;

    a = sc.nextDouble();
    b = sc.nextDouble();
    cc = sc.nextDouble();
    cc = Math.toRadians(cc);

    s = a * b * Math.sin(cc) / 2.0;
    l = a + b + Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b - 2.0 * a * b * Math.cos(cc));
    h = b * Math.sin(cc);

    System.out.println(s);
    System.out.println(l);
    System.out.println(h);

    sc.close();
  }
  public static void main(String[] args){
    (new Main()).run(System.in, System.out);
  }
}
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
4 3 90

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable `a`, variable `b` and variable `cc` are initialized with 4, 3 and 90, respectively.
The value of variable `cc` is converted from degrees to radians.
The value of variable `s` is calculated by multiplying the values of variables `a` and `b` and the sine of variable `cc` and dividing it by 2.
The value of variable `l` is calculated by adding the values of variables `a` and `b` and the square root of the difference of the square of variable `a` and the square of variable `b` and the product of the values of variables `a` and `b` and the cosine of variable `cc`.
The value of variable `h` is calculated by multiplying the value of variable `b` and the sine of variable `cc`.
The values of variables `s`, `l` and `h` are printed as output.

The output of code execution is:
10.828427124746191
5.0
1.5
