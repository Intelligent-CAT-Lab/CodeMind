Instruction: I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.NoSuchElementException;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);
		
		long x = sc.nextLong();
		sc.close();
		
		long ans = x / 11 * 2 + x % 11 / 7 + Math.min(x % 11, 1);
		out.println(ans);
		out.flush();
	}
	
}

class Scanner {
	private final InputStream in;
	private final byte[] buffer;
	private int ptr;
	private int buflen;
	
	public Scanner(InputStream in) {
		this.in = in;
		this.buffer = new byte[1024];
		this.ptr = 0;
		this.buflen = 0;
	}
	
	public void close() {
		try {
			this.in.close();
		} catch (IOException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
	
	private boolean hasNextByte() {
		if (ptr < buflen) {
			return true;
		} else {
			ptr = 0;
			try {
				buflen = in.read(buffer);
			} catch (IOException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
			if (buflen <= 0) {
				return false;
			}
		}
		return true;
	}
	
	private byte readByte() {
		if (hasNextByte()) {
			return buffer[ptr++];
		} else {
			return -1;
		}
	}
	
	private boolean isPrintableChar(int c) {
		return '!' <= c && c <= '~';
	}
	
	private void skipUnprintable() {
		while (hasNextByte() &&!isPrintableChar(buffer[ptr])) {
			ptr++;
		}
	}
	
	public boolean hasNext() {
		skipUnprintable();
		return hasNextByte();
	}
	
	public long nextLong() {
		if (!hasNext()) {
			throw new NoSuchElementException();
		}
		long n = 0;
		boolean minus = false;
		byte b = readByte();
		if (b == '-') {
			minus = true;
			b = readByte();
		}
		if (b < '0' || '9' < b) {
			throw new NumberFormatException();
		}
		while (true) {
			if ('0' <= b && b <= '9') {
				n *= 10;
				n += b - '0';
			} else if (b == -1 ||!isPrintableChar(b)) {
				return minus? -n : n;
			} else {
				throw new NumberFormatException();
			}
			b = readByte();
		}
	}
	
}
