Instruction: I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String pat = "A{0,1}KIHA{0,1}BA{0,1}RA{0,1}";
        String s = sc.next();
        if(s.matches(pat)) System.out.println("YES");
        else System.out.println("NO");
        sc.close();
    }

}

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
KIHBR

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable `pat` is initialized with "A{0,1}KIHA{0,1}BA{0,1}RA{0,1}".
The variable `s` is initialized with "KIHBR".
The method `matches` of the class `String` is called with the argument `pat`.
The method `println` of the class `System.out` is called with the argument "YES".
The output of code execution is:
YES
END-OF-OUTPUT

def main():
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    # Please take input and print output to standard input/output (stdin/stdout)
    # E.g. 'input()/raw_input()' for input & 'print' for output
    s = input()
    pat = "A{0,1}KIHA{0,1}BA{0,1}RA{0,1}"
    if re.match(pat, s):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
