Instruction: I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		try(Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
			

			int n = sc.nextInt();
			int m = sc.nextInt();

			int nComb = n * (n-1) / 2;
			int mComb = m * (m-1) / 2;
			
			System.out.println(nComb + mComb);
			
		}
	}

}
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
2 1

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable `n` is initialized with 2 and variable `m` is initialized with 1.
The value of variable `nComb` is calculated by multiplying `n` with `(n-1)` and then dividing it by 2. The value of variable `mComb` is calculated in the same way.
The value of variable `nComb` is added to variable `mComb` and the final value is printed as output.

The output of code execution is:
3
