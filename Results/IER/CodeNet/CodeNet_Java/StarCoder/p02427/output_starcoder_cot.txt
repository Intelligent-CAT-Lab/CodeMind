Instruction: I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();

		for(int i = 0; i < Math.pow(2, n); i++) {
			int temp = i;
			System.out.print(i + ":");
			for(int j = 0; temp > 0; j++) {
				if(temp % 2 == 1) System.out.print(" " + j);
				temp /= 2;
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
	}
}

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
4

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable `n` is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 16 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `temp` and variable `j` is initialized with 0.
Then it enters a while loop and it iterates from 0 to `temp` to check each integer `j` in this range.
In each iteration, it checks if the remainder of `temp` divided by 2 is 1. If it is, it prints the value of `j` and the value of `i` as output.
When the loop finishes, it prints a new line as output.

The output of code execution is:
0: 0
1: 0 1
2: 0 1 2
3: 0 1 2 3
4: 0 1 2 3 4
5: 0 1 2 3 4 5
6: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
7: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
