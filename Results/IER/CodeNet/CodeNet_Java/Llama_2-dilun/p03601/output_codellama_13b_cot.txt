The input is 1 2 10 20 15 200.

The first step is to initialize the variables a, b, c, d, e and f with 1, 2, 10, 20, 15 and 200 respectively.

The second step is to initialize the variables waterX, ansWater and ansSugar with 0, 100 and 0 respectively.

The third step is to enter a while loop and it iterates until the condition is met. The condition is met when 100 * a * waterX <= 200.

The fourth step is to initialize the variable waterY with 0.

The fifth step is to enter a while loop and it iterates until the condition is met. The condition is met when 100 * a * waterX + 100 * b * waterY <= 200.

The sixth step is to initialize the variable water with 100 * a * waterX + 100 * b * waterY.

The seventh step is to enter a while loop and it iterates until the condition is met. The condition is met when water + c * sugarX <= 200.

The eighth step is to initialize the variable sugarX with 0.

The ninth step is to enter a while loop and it iterates until the condition is met. The condition is met when water + c * sugarX <= 200.

The tenth step is to initialize the variable sugarY with 0.

The eleventh step is to enter a while loop and it iterates until the condition is met. The condition is met when water + c * sugarX + d * sugarY <= 200.

The twelfth step is to initialize the variable sugar with c * sugarX + d * sugarY.

The thirteenth step is to check if sugar * (100 + e) <= e * (water + sugar).

The fourteenth step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The fifteenth step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The sixteenth step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The seventeenth step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The eighteenth step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The nineteenth step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The twentieth step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The twenty-first step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The twenty-second step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The twenty-third step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The twenty-fourth step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The twenty-fifth step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The twenty-sixth step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The twenty-seventh step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The twenty-eighth step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).

The twenty-ninth step is to check if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar *
