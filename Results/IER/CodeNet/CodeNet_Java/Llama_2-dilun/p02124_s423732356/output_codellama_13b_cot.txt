The variable a is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the input is not empty.
Inside the while loop, it extracts the value of variable a from the input.
Then it calculates the value of variable b by dividing variable a by 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to b to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it adds 3 to the string str.
After the loop finishes, it print the string str as output, which is "ai1333".
<<<Output>>>
ai1333

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		while(sc.hasNext()) {
			int a = sc.nextInt();
			String str = "ai1333";
			
			int b = a/100;
			if(b>0)
			for(int i=1;i<=b;i++) {
				str += 3;
			}
			System.out.println(str);
		}
	
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
