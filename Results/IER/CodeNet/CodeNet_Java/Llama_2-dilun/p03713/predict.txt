The variable h and variable w are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if statement to check if h and w are both divisible by 3. If it is, it prints the output 0.
Otherwise, it enters a if statement to check if h is greater than w. If it is, it swaps the values of h and w.
Then it calculates the product of h and w, which is 15.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to h to calculate the sum of the products of h and w with the current interger h_loop.
It calculates the sum of the products of h and w with the current interger h_loop by repeatedly extracting the current interger h_loop from h and multiplying it with w.
It calculates the sum of the products of h and w with the current interger h_loop by repeatedly extracting the current interger h_loop from w and multiplying it with h.
