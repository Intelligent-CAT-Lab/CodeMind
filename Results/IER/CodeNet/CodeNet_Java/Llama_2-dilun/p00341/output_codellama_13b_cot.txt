<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads 12 integers from the input and stores them in the LinkedList e.
Then it checks if the number of distinct elements in e is greater than 3.
If it is, it prints "no" and returns.
Otherwise, it sorts the elements in e and then uses the stream() method to filter out the elements that are equal to each other.
It then counts the number of elements that are equal to each other and checks if it is 4, 8 or 12.
If it is not, it prints "no" and returns.
Otherwise, it prints "yes".
<<<Output>>>
yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        int sum = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
            sum += arr[i];
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code first reads the input and stores it in the array arr.
Then it iterates through the array and calculates the sum of the elements in the array.
Finally, it prints the sum.
