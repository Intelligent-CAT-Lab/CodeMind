The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if k is 1. If it is, it sets the variable ans to 0. Otherwise, it sets the variable ans to n - k.
It prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		
		if(k == 1){
			System.out.println(n);
		}else{
			System.out.println(n - k);
		}
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
