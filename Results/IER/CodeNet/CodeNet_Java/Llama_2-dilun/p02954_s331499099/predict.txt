The code first reads the input string S from the user.
Then it creates an ArrayList Sa and adds the string S to it.
Then it iterates through the string S and checks if the current character is R and the next character is L.
If it is, it iterates through the string S from the current character to the end of the string.
If it finds a character R, it adds the substring of the string S from the previous character to the current character to the ArrayList Sa.
If it reaches the end of the string, it adds the substring of the string S from the previous character to the end of the string to the ArrayList Sa.

After the loop finishes, it iterates through the ArrayList Sa and checks if the length of the string is even.
If it is, it iterates through the string and prints the length of the string divided by 2.
If it is not, it iterates through the string and prints the length of the string divided by 2 + 1.
