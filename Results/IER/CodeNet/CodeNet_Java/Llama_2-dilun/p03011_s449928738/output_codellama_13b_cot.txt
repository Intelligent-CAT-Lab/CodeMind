The variable X is initialized with 1, 3 and 4.
It sorts the array X in ascending order.
It prints the first and second element of the array X, which is 1 and 3.
<<<Output>>>
1 3
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in); 
		
		int[] X = new int[3];
		
		X[0] = keyboard.nextInt();
		X[1] = keyboard.nextInt();
		X[2] = keyboard.nextInt();
		
		Arrays.sort(X);
		
		System.out.println(X[0]+ X[1]);
		keyboard.close();	
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
