The variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It prints the output of the code, which is 12.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();

		System.out.println((n-1)*(m-1));
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
