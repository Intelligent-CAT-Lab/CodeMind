The variable a, b and c are initialized with 2, 4 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the difference between b and a, which is 2.
It calculates the difference between c and b, which is 2.
It checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between c and b.
If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import static java.lang.Math.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		// 入力
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		
		// 計算
		String result = "NO";
		if(b - a == c - b) result = "YES";
		
		
		// 出力
		System.out.println(result);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 4 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
