The variable A, B and K are initialized with 8, 12 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 1 to 12 to check each integer z in this range.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current integer z is a common divisor of A and B. If it is, it stores the value of z in the array s and increments the variable y.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable s[y-K] as output, which is 6.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner stdIn=new Scanner(System.in);
		int A=stdIn.nextInt();
		int B=stdIn.nextInt();
		int K=stdIn.nextInt();
		int s[]=new int[A+B];
		int z=1,y=0;
		while(z<=A&&z<=B){
			if(A%z==0&&B%z==0){
				s[y]=z;
				y++;
			}
			z++;
		}
		System.out.println(s[y-K]);
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 12 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
