The variable line is initialized with the input string.
The variable length is initialized with the length of the input string.
The substring method is called with the first argument as the starting index and the second argument as the length of the substring.
The substring method returns the substring of the input string starting from the first character to the last character before the last 8 characters.
The substring method returns the substring "CODEFESTIVAL".
<<<Output>>>
CODEFESTIVAL
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[INST]
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String line = sc.next();
        int length = line.length();
        System.out.println(line.substring(0,line.length()-8));
    }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```CODEFESTIVAL
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
