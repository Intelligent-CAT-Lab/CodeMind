    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System. in);
		int c = 0;
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		String s = sc.next();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		if(s.equals("+")) {
			c = a + b;

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 - 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
