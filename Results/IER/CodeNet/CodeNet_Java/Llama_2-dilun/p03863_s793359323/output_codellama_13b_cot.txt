The variable n is initialized with the length of the input string s.
The variable eq is initialized with the value of the first character of the input string s and the last character of the input string s.
If the first and last character of the input string s are the same, the variable eq is set to true. Otherwise, it is set to false.
Then it checks if the variable eq is true or false. If it is true, it prints "First" as output. Otherwise, it prints "Second" as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.next();
		sc.close();

		int n = s.length();
		boolean eq = s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(n - 1);
		if (eq) {
			System.out.println(n % 2 == 0? "First" : "Second");
		} else {
			System.out.println(n % 2 == 1? "First" : "Second");
		}
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abab
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
