The variable arr is initialized with the input string "MRL".
It iterates through the array arr and modifies each character in the array.
The character at index i is modified by subtracting 3 from its ASCII value and adding 26 to it.
Then it adds the modified character to the character 'A' and stores the result in the array at index i.
The output is "MRL".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        char[] arr = sc.next().toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            arr[i] = (char)((arr[i] - 'A' - 3 + 26) % 26 + 'A');
        }
        System.out.println(arr);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```MRL
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
