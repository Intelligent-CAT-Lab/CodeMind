The variable c is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is equal to 'D' or '?'. If it is, it increments the variable count.
Then it checks if the current character c[i] is equal to 'D'. If it is, it replaces it with 'D'.
Then it prints the current character c[i] to the output.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line to the output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        @SuppressWarnings("resource")
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        char[] c = sc.next().toCharArray();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0 ; i < c.length ; i++) {
            if (c[i] == 'D' ||c[i]  ==  '?') {
                count++;
                c[i] = 'D';
            }
            System.out.print(c[i]);
        }
        System.out.print("\n");

    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```PD?D??P
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
