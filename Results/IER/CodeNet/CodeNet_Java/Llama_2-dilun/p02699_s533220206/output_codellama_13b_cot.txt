The first line of the code is a conditional statement. It checks if the first integer is greater than the second integer.
The second line of the code is a print statement. It prints "safe" if the first integer is greater than the second integer.
Otherwise, it prints "unsafe".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        if(s.nextInt()>s.nextInt()) System.out.println("safe");
        else System.out.println("unsafe");

    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
