The variable s is initialized with the input string "this is a pen.".
It enters a while loop and it iterates as long as the variable s is not empty.
Inside the while loop, it converts the variable s to uppercase and prints it.
After the loop finishes, it prints a blank line.
<<<Output>>>
THIS IS A PEN.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try(Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)){
			while(sc.hasNext()) {
				String s = sc.nextLine();
				System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
			}
		}
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```this is a pen.
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
