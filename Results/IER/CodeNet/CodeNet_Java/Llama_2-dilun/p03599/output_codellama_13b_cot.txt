The variable A, B, C, D and E are initialized with 1, 2, 10, 20 and 15 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 200 to check each integer a in this range. The value of variable a is also passed to variable ans1.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 200 to check each integer b in this range. The value of variable b is also passed to variable ans2.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 200 to check each integer c in this range. The value of variable c is also passed to variable ans2.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 200 to check each integer d in this range. The value of variable d is also passed to variable ans2.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the calculated variable ans2 is less than the calculated variable ans1. If it is, it updates the value of variable ans1 and variable ans2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans1 and variable ans2 as output, which is 150 150.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int A = sc.nextInt();
		int B = sc.nextInt();
		int C = sc.nextInt();
		int D = sc.nextInt();
		int E = sc.nextInt();
		int ans1 = A * 100;
		int ans2 = 0;
		for(int a = 0; a <= B / (A * 100); a++) {
			for(int b = 0; b <= B / (B * 100); b++) {
				for(int c = 0; c <= B / C; c++) {
					for(int d = 0; d <= B / D; d++) {
						if(100 * a * A + 100 * b * B + C * c + D * d <= B && (double)(C * c + D * d) / (double)(a * A * 100 + b * B * 100) <= (double)E / (double)100) {
							if(a == 0 && b == 0) continue;
							if((double)ans2 / (double)ans1 < (double)(C * c + D * d) / (double)(100 * a * A + 100 * b * B + C * c + D * d)) {
								ans1 = 100 * a * A + 100 * b * B + C * c + D * d;
								ans2 = C * c + D * d;
							}
						}
					}
				}
			}

		System.out.println((int)ans1 + " " + (int)ans2);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 10 20 15 200
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
