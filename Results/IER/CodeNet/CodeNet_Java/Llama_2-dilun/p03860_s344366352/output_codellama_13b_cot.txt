The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with "AtCoder Beginner Contest" according to the input.
Then it prints the first character of variable a, variable b and variable c, which is "A", "B" and "C" respectively.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
 
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String a = sc.next();
		String b = sc.next();
		String c = sc.next();
		System.out.println(a.charAt(0)+""+b.charAt(0)+""+c.charAt(0));
	}
		
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```AtCoder Beginner Contest
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
