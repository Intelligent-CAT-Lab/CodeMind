The variable N, A and B are initialized with 7, 17 and 120 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the product of N and A, which is 119.
It checks if the product is greater than B. If it is, it prints B as output. Otherwise, it prints the product as output.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N,A,B,pp;
        N=sc.nextInt();
        A=sc.nextInt();
        B=sc.nextInt();
        pp=N*A;

        if(pp>B) System.out.println(B);
        else System.out.println(pp);
    }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 17 120
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
