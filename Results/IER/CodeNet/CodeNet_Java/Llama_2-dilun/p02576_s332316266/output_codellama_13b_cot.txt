The variable n, variable x and variable t are initialized with 20, 12 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if statement to check if n is divisible by x. If it is, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying the value of n by t and dividing it by x.
If it is not, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying the value of m by t and adding 1 to it.
The value of m is calculated by dividing the value of n by x.
After the if statement finishes, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 120.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    int x = sc.nextInt();
    int t = sc.nextInt();
    int ans;
    if (n%x == 0){
      ans = (n/x) * t;
    }else{
      int m =  n / x;
      ans = (m+1) *t;
    }
    System.out.println(ans);
  }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 12 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
