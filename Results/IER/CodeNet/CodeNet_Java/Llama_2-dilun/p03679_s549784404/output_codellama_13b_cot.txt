The variable X, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 3 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if B is less than A. If it is, it prints "delicious".
Otherwise, it checks if the difference between B and A is less than X. If it is, it prints "safe".
Otherwise, it prints "dangerous".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
	public class Main
		{ public static void main(String[] args)
			{   
			    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
			    int X = scanner.nextInt();
			    int A = scanner.nextInt();
			    int B = scanner.nextInt();
			    
			    if (B <= A) {
			    	System.out.println("delicious");
			    } else if ((B-A) <= X) {
			    	System.out.println("safe");
			    } else {
			    	System.out.println("dangerous");
			    }
		}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 3 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
