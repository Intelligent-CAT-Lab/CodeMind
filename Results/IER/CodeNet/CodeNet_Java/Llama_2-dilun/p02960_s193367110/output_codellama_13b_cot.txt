The variable M is initialized with 10000000007.
The variable s is initialized with the input string.
The variable dp is initialized with a 2D array of size 13.
The variable map is initialized with an array of 13 integers.
The variable dp[0][0] is initialized with 1.

The for loop iterates from 1 to s.length to process each character in the input string.
Inside the for loop, the variable ch is initialized with the current character in the input string.
The variable j is initialized with 0.
The variable l is initialized with 0.

The variable dp[i][j] is initialized with 0.

The if statement checks if the current character is '?'. If it is, it iterates from 0 to 9 to process each digit in the range [0, 9].
Inside the if statement, the variable k is initialized with 0.
The variable l is initialized with j - k.
If l is less than 0, it is added by 13.
The variable dp[i][j] is initialized with dp[i - 1][map[l]].
If dp[i][j] is greater than or equal to M, it is decreased by M.

The else statement checks if the current character is not '?'. If it is, it iterates from 0 to 12 to process each digit in the range [0, 12].
Inside the else statement, the variable l is initialized with j - (ch - '0').
If l is less than 0, it is added by 13.
The variable dp[i][j] is initialized with dp[i - 1][map[l]].

After the for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable dp[s.length][5], which is 10000000000.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    long M = 1_000_000_007;
    char[] s = scanner.next().toCharArray();
    long[][] dp = new long[s.length + 1][13];
    int[] map = {0, 4, 8, 12, 3, 7, 11, 2, 6, 10, 1, 5, 9};

    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= s.length; i++) {
      char ch = s[i - 1];
      for (int j = 0; j < 13; j++) {
        if (ch == '?') {
          for (int k = 0; k < 10; k++) {
            int l = j - k;
            if (l < 0) l += 13;
            dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][map[l]];
            if (dp[i][j] >= M) dp[i][j] -= M;
          }
        } else {
          int l = j - (ch - '0');
          if (l < 0) l += 13;
          dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][map[l]];
        }
      }
    }
    System.out.println(dp[s.length][5]);
