The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from A to N to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it converts the integer i to a string and then extracts each character of the string.
It calculates the sum of the digits of the current character by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        sc.close();

        int answer = 0;

        char[] char_ary = null;
        int sum = 0;
        boolean add_flg = true;
        for (int i = A; i <= N; i++) {
            char_ary = Integer.toString(i).toCharArray();

            sum = 0;
            add_flg = true;
            for (char elm : char_ary) {

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
