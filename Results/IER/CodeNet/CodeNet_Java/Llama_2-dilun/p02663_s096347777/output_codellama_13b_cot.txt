The variable H1, M1, H2 and M2 are initialized with 10, 0, 15 and 0 respectively according to the input. And variable K is initialized with 30.
It calculates the start time by multiplying H1 with 60 and adding M1.
It calculates the end time by multiplying H2 with 60 and adding M2.
It calculates the difference between the start time and the end time.
It subtracts the value of K from the calculated difference.
It prints the final value as output, which is 150.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;


public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int H1= sc.nextInt();
		int M1= sc.nextInt();
		int H2 = sc.nextInt();
		int M2= sc.nextInt();
		int K = sc.nextInt();
		int start = H1*60+M1;
		int end = H2*60+M2;
		System.out.println(end-start-K);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 0 15 0 30
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
