The variable X and variable Y are initialized with 81 and 58 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the sum of X and Y by adding them together.
It prints the sum of X and Y by dividing it by 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        try (Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in)) {
            int X = in.nextInt();
            int Y = in.nextInt();
            System.out.println(X + Y / 2);
        }
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```81 58
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
