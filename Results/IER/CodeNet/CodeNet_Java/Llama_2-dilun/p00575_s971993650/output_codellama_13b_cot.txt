The variable a, b and c are initialized with 3, 0 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable coins reaches 10.
Inside the while loop, it increments the value of variable day by 1.
Then it increments the value of variable coins by variable a.
If the value of variable day is divisible by 7, it increments the value of variable coins by variable b.
After the loop finishes, it print the value of variable day as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int day = 0;
        int coins = 0;
        while (coins < c) {
            day++;
            coins += a;
            if(day%7 == 0) {
                coins += b;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(day);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 0 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
