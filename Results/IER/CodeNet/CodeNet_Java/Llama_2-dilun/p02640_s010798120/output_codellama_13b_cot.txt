The variable x and variable y are initialized with 3 and 8 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the integers 2*i and 4*(x-i) and stores it in variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to variable y. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, it prints "No" as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x = sc.nextInt();
		int y = sc.nextInt();
		boolean flg = false;
		for (int i = 0; i <= x; i++) {
			int sum = 2*i + 4*(x-i);
			if (sum == y) {
				flg = true;
				break;
			}
		}
		if (flg) {
			System.out.println("Yes");
		} else {
			System.out.println("No");
		}
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
