The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sunukeNum.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger sunukeNum by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable gradesum.
Then it calculates the value of variable gradesum by dividing it by 10.
Then it prints the value of variable gradesum as output, which is 0.1.
<<<Output>>>
0.1

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();

		long sunukeNum = 1;

		for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
			
			String sunukeString = "" + sunukeNum;
			double min = Double.MAX_VALUE;
			long sunukecand = 0;

			for(int j=0;j<sunukeString.length() + 1;j++){
				String nine = "";
				for(int k=0;k<j;k++){
					nine += "9";
				}

				String compose = sunukeString.substring(0,sunukeString.length() - j) + nine;
				double sunukecandidate = Long.parseLong(compose)*calc(Long.parseLong(compose));

				if(min > sunukecandidate){
					min = sunukecandidate;
					sunukecand = Long.parseLong(compose);
				}

			}

			System.out.println(sunukecand);
			sunukeNum = sunukecand + 1;

		}
	}
	public static double calc(long num){
		int gradesum = 0;
		while(num >= 1){
			gradesum += num%10;
			num = num/10;
		}
		return (double)1/gradesum;
	}
 
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
