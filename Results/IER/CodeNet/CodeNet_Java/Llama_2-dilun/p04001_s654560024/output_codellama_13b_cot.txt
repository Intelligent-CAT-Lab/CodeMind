The variable s is initialized with the input string "125".
The variable num is initialized with an array of integers with length equal to the length of the input string.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates from 0 to Math.pow(2, s.length() - 1) to calculate the answer.

Inside the for loop, the variable index is initialized with the binary representation of the current value of i.
The variable index is padded with zeros to make it equal to the length of the input string.

The variable instance is initialized with the first element of the array num.

The while loop iterates from 1 to the length of the input string.

Inside the while loop, if the current character of the input string is 0, the variable instance is multiplied by 10 and then added with the current element of the array num.
Otherwise, the variable instance is added with the current element of the array num.

The variable count is initialized with 0.

The variable instance is initialized with the first element of the array num.

The while loop iterates from 1 to the length of the input string.

Inside the while loop, if the current character of the input string is 0, the variable instance is multiplied by 10 and then added with the current element of the array num.
Otherwise, the variable instance is added with the current element of the array num.

Otherwise, the variable instance is added with the current element of the array num.

The variable ans is added with the variable count and the variable instance.

After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 125.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        int[] num = new int[s.length()];
        for (int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
            num[i]=s.charAt(i)-'1'+1;
        }
        long ans = 0;
        for (int i=0;i<Math.pow(2,s.length()-1);i++){
            String index = Integer.toBinaryString(i);
            while (index.length()<s.length()-1)index="0"+index;
            long count=0;
            long instance=num[0];
            for (int j=1;j<s.length();j++){
                if (index.charAt(j-1)=='0'){
                    instance*=10;
                    instance+=num[j];
                }else {
                    count+=instance;
                    instance=num[j];
                }
            }
            ans += count+instance;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```125
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
