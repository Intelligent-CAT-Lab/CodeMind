The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable P is initialized with 24.
It checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of P and exits the program.
Otherwise, it initializes the variable upper with the square root of P plus 1.
It initializes the variable ans with 1.
It enters a for loop and iterates from 2 to upper and checks if the value of i is less than or equal to P.
If it is, it checks if P is divisible by i. If it is, it initializes the variable cnt with 0.
It enters a while loop and checks if P is divisible by i. If it is, it increments the value of cnt by 1.
It divides P by i and checks if the value of P is 0. If it is, it exits the while loop.
It multiplies the value of ans by the value of i raised to the power of the value of cnt divided by the value of n.
It prints the value of ans.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 24
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
