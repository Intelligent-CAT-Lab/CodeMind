The variable n is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2^4 - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable factorial.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the factorial of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable factorial.
Then it checks if the calculated variable factorial falls within the range [0, 15]. If it does, it prints the current interger i and the position of the first 1 in the binary representation of variable factorial.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable factorial as output, which is 15.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int n, i, j, factorial;
		String str;
		try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
			n = sc.nextInt();
			factorial = (int) (Math.pow(2, n));
			char[] cha = new char[n];
			for(i = 0; i < factorial; i++) {
				str = Integer.toBinaryString(i);
				for(j = 0; j < str.length(); j++) {
					cha[j] = str.charAt(j);
				}
				System.out.print(i + ":");
				for(j = 0; j < str.length(); j++) {

				}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
