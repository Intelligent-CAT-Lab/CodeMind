The variable N and variable K are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if N >= K*2-1.
Since N is 3 and K is 2, N >= K*2-1 is true.
So it prints "YES" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	static int N = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
	static int K = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		if (N >= K*2-1 ) {
			System.out.println("YES");

		} else {

			System.out.println("NO");
		}
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
