The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable a is initialized with the string "ab".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 127 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable s.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character at index i of variable s and stores it in variable s[i].
Then it calculates the length of variable s, which is 2.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 128 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character at index i of variable a and stores it in variable a[i].
Then it calculates the sum of the values of variable a, which is 1.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 128 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character at index i of variable a and stores it in variable a[i].
Then it calculates the sum of the values of variable a, which is 2.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 128 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character at index i of variable a and stores it in variable a[i].
Then it calculates the sum of the values of variable a, which is 3.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 128 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character at index i of variable a and stores it in variable a[i].
Then it calculates the sum of the values of variable a, which is 4.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 128 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character at index i of variable a and stores it in variable a[i].
Then it calculates the sum of the values of variable a, which is 5.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 128 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character at index i of variable a and stores it in variable a[i].
Then it calculates the sum of the values of variable a, which is 6.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 128 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character at index i of variable a and stores it in variable a[i].
Then it calculates the sum of the values of variable a, which is 7.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 128 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character at index i of variable a and stores it in variable a[i].
Then it calculates the sum of the values of variable a, which is 8.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 128 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character at index i of variable a and stores it in variable a[i].
Then it calculates the sum of the values of variable a, which is 9.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 128 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character at index i of variable a and stores it in variable a[i].
Then it calculates the sum of the values of variable a, which is 10.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 128 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed
