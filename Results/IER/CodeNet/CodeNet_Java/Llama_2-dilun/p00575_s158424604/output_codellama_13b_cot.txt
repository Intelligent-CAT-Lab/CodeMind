The variable a, b and goal are initialized with 3, 0 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable coin reaches the goal.
Inside the while loop, it adds the value of variable a to variable coin.
If the value of variable day is divisible by 7, it adds the value of variable b to variable coin.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable day-1 as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int goal = sc.nextInt();
        int day = 1;
        int coin = 0;
        
        while(coin < goal){
            coin += a;
            if(day % 7 == 0)
                coin += b;
            day++;
        }
        System.out.println(day-1);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 0 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
