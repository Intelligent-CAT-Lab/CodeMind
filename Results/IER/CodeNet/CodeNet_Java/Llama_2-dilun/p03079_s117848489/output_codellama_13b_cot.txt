The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable a is equal to the value of variable b and variable c.
Since the value of variable a is equal to the value of variable b and variable c, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scan.nextInt();
        int b = scan.nextInt();
        int c = scan.nextInt();

        if((a == b) && (a == c)){            
            System.out.println("Yes");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
