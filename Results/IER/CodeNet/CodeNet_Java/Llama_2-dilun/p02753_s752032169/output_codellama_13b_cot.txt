The input is split into three words by the split function.
Then the if-else statement is executed.
If the first word is A, the second word is A and the third word is A, the result is No.
If the first word is B, the second word is B and the third word is B, the result is No.
Otherwise, the result is Yes.
<<<Output>>>

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Your code here!
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        String S =sc.next();
        String word[] =S.split("");

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ABA
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
