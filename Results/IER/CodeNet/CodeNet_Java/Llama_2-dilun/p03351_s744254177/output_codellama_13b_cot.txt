The variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 4, 7, 9 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to d.
If it is, it prints "Yes".
Otherwise, it checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to d and the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to d.
If it is, it prints "Yes".
Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
  int a = scan.nextInt();
    int b =scan.nextInt();
    int c = scan.nextInt();
    int d = scan.nextInt();
    
    if(Math.abs(a-c) <= d || (Math.abs(a-b)<= d && Math.abs(b-c)<=d) ){
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }else{

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 7 9 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
