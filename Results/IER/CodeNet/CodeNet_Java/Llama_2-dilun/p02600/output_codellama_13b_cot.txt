The variable x is initialized with 725.
The variable k is initialized with 0.
The condition 400 <= x && x < 600 is evaluated.
Since 400 <= 725 && 725 < 600 is true, the variable k is assigned with 8.
The condition 600 <= x && x < 800 is evaluated.
Since 600 <= 725 && 725 < 800 is true, the variable k is assigned with 7.
The condition 800 <= x && x < 1000 is evaluated.
Since 800 <= 725 && 725 < 1000 is true, the variable k is assigned with 6.
The condition 1000 <= x && x < 1200 is evaluated.
Since 1000 <= 725 && 725 < 1200 is true, the variable k is assigned with 5.
The condition 1200 <= x && x < 1400 is evaluated.
Since 1200 <= 725 && 725 < 1400 is true, the variable k is assigned with 4.
The condition 1400 <= x && x < 1600 is evaluated.
Since 1400 <= 725 && 725 < 1600 is true, the variable k is assigned with 3.
The condition 1600 <= x && x < 1800 is evaluated.
Since 1600 <= 725 && 725 < 1800 is true, the variable k is assigned with 2.
The condition 1800 <= x && x <= 1999 is evaluated.
Since 1800 <= 725 && 725 <= 1999 is true, the variable k is assigned with 1.
The variable k is printed as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    int x = sc.nextInt();
    int k = 0;
    if(400 <= x && x < 600) k = 8;
    else if(600 <= x && x < 800) k = 7;
    else if(800 <= x && x < 1000) k = 6;
    else if(1000 <= x && x < 1200) k = 5;
    else if(1200 <= x && x < 1400) k = 4;
    else if(1400 <= x && x < 1600) k = 3;
    else if(1600 <= x && x < 1800) k = 2;
    else if(1800 <= x && x <= 1999) k = 1;
    System.out.println(k);
  }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1999
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
