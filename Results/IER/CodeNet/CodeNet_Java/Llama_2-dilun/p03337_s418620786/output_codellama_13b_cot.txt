The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the maximum of a+b, a-b and a*b.
The maximum of a+b and a-b is 4.
The maximum of a*b and a+b is 3.
The maximum of a*b and a-b is 3.
The maximum of a+b, a-b and a*b is 4.
It prints the maximum of a+b, a-b and a*b as output, which is 4.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		
		System.out.println(Math.max(Math.max(a+b, a-b), a*b));
		
		
	}	
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
