The variable s is initialized with the input string "ABC".
It checks if the value of variable s is equal to "ABC". If it is, it prints "ARC" as output. Otherwise, it prints "ABC" as output.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        if(s.equals("ABC")){
            System.out.println("ARC");
        }else{
            System.out.println("ABC");
        }
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ABC
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
