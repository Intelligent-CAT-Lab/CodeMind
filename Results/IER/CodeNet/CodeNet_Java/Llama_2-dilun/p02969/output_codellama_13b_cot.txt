The variable a is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It prints the value of a*a*3, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a*a*3);
    }
}


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
