The variable pre_char is initialized with 'A' and the variable cnt is initialized with 0.
It iterates through the input string and calculates the difference between the current character and the previous character.
If the current character is greater than the previous character, it adds the difference to the variable cnt.
Otherwise, it adds the difference to the variable cnt and adds 26 to it.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable cnt divided by 26 as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String ins = sc.next();
		int length = ins.length();
		int pre_char = 'A';
		int cnt = 0;
		for (int i=0;i<length;i++) {
			int c = ins.charAt(i);
			if (c > pre_char) cnt = cnt + (c - pre_char);
			else cnt = cnt + (c - pre_char) + 26;
			pre_char = c;

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```AIZU
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
