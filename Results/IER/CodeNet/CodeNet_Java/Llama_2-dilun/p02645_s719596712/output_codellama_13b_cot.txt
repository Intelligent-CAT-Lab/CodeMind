The variable name is initialized with the input "takahashi".
Then it extracts the first 3 characters of the variable name and print it.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
  	public static void main(String args[]){
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      String name = sc.next();
      System.out.print(name.substring(0,3));
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```takahashi
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
