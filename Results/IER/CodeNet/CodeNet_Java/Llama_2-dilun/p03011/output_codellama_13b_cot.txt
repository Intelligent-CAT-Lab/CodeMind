The variable P, Q and R are initialized with 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if P is greater than Q. If it is, it checks if P is greater than R. If it is, it sets max to Q + R. If it is not, it sets max to P + Q.
If P is not greater than Q, it checks if Q is greater than R. If it is, it sets max to Q + R. If it is not, it sets max to P + Q.
If P is not greater than Q and Q is not greater than R, it checks if R is greater than P. If it is, it sets max to P + R. If it is not, it sets max to P + Q.

After the code finishes, it prints the value of max, which is 7.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
    	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      	int P,Q,R;
      	int max = 0;
      	P = sc.nextInt();
      	Q = sc.nextInt();
      	R = sc.nextInt();

      	if(P >= Q){
        	if(P >= R){
            	max = Q + R;
            }else{
            	max = P + Q;
            }
        }else if(Q >= R){
					if(Q >= P){
							max = P + R;
					}else{
							max = Q + R;

      	System.out.println(max);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
