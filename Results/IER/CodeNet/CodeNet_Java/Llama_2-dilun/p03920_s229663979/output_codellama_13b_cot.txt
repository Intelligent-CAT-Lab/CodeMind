The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [1, 4]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable l. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3 and 4.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable l as output, which is [1, 2, 3, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] __){
		int
		n=new java.util.Scanner(System.in).nextInt(),
		sum=0;
		ArrayList<Integer>l=new ArrayList<>();
		for(int i=1;sum<=n;i++) {
			sum+=i;
			l.add(i);
		}
		l.remove(Integer.valueOf(sum-n));
		l.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
