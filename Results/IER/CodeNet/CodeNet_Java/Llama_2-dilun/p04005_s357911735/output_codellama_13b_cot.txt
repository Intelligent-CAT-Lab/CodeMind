The variable a is initialized with 3, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    long[] a = new long[3];
    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      a[i] = sc.nextLong();
    }
    Arrays.sort(a);
    long ans = 0;
    if(((a[0] % 2) == 1) && ((a[1] % 2) == 1) && ((a[2] % 2) == 1)) ans = (a[0] * a[1]);
    System.out.println(ans);
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
