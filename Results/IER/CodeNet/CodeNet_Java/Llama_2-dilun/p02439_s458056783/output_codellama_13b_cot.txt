<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, b and c are initialized with 4, 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It prints the minimum of the minimum of a, b and c, which is 3.
It prints the maximum of the maximum of a, b and c, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
3 5

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try(Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)){
			int a = sc.nextInt();
			int b = sc.nextInt();
			int c = sc.nextInt();

			System.out.println(String.format("%d %d", Math.min(Math.min(a, b), c), Math.max(Math.max(a, b), c)));
		}
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
