The variable s is initialized with the input string.
It iterates through the string and checks if the current character is 1. If it is, it increments the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        char[] s = sc.next().toCharArray();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
            if(s[i] == '1') {

        System.out.println(ans);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```111100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
