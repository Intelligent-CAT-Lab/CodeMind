The variable N is initialized with 12 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until N is less than 10.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable fx by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable fx.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable X is divisible by the value of variable fx. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	 
	int N = sc.nextInt();

	int X = N;

	int fx = 0;


	while(N>=10) {

		fx += N%10;

		N /= 10;

	}

	fx += N;

	if(X%fx == 0) System.out.println("Yes");

	else System.out.println("No");
}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
