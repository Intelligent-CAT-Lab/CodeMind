The variable e is initialized with 0 and variable y is initialized with 2015.
The variable f is initialized with the array {1868,1912,1926,1989,2017}.
The variable g is initialized with the array {'M','T','S','H'}.

The variable e is checked to see if it is 0. If it is, it enters a for loop and iterates from 0 to 3.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the variable y is less than or equal to the value of f[i+1]-1. If it is, it prints the value of g[i] followed by the value of (y-f[i])+1.
If the condition is not met, it breaks the loop.

If the variable e is not 0, it prints the value of y followed by the value of f[e-1]-1.

The output is 2015.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int e=sc.nextInt(),y=sc.nextInt();
        int[] f= {1868,1912,1926,1989,2017};
        char[] g= {'M','T','S','H'};
        if(e==0) {
            for(int i=0;i<4;i++) {
                if(y<=f[i+1]-1) {
                    System.out.println(g[i]+""+((y-f[i])+1));
                    break;
                }
            }
        }else {
            System.out.println(y+f[e-1]-1);
        }
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 2015
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
