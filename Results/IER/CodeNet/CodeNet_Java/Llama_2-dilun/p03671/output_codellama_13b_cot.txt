The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 700, 600 and 780 respectively according to the input.
Then it sorts the array sum with the elements a, b and c.
Finally it prints the sum of the first two elements of the array sum, which is 1380.
<<<Output>>>
1380

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();

        int[] sum = {a,b,c};
        Arrays.sort(sum);

        System.out.println(sum[0]+sum[1]);
    }

}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```700 600 780
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
