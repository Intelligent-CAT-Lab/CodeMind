The variable h and variable w are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable h2 and variable w2.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger h2 by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable s1.
Then it checks if the calculated variable s1 falls within the range [0, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
