The variable S is initialized with the input string "ASSA".
Then it iterates through the string S and for each character c in the string, it checks if the character c is already in the map m. If it is, it increments the value of the key c in the map m. If it is not, it adds the character c to the map m with value 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the map m has 2 keys. If it does, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

        String S = sc.next();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable S is initialized with the input string "10".
Then it parses the string S to an integer n.
Then it iterates through the integer n and for each integer i in the range [1, 10], it adds i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable sum, which is 55.
<<<Output>>>
