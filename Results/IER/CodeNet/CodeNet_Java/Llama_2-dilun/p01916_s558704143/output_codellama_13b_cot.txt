The variable s is initialized with the input string "hcpc".
The variable a is initialized with an array of 26 integers.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates from 0 to the length of the input string.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character at the current index of the input string and stores it in the variable s.
Then it calculates the index of the character in the alphabet and stores it in the variable i.
Finally, it increments the value of the element at the index i in the array a.

After the loop finishes, it calculates the sum of the values in the array a by iterating from 0 to 25.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the remainder of the value of the element at the index i in the array a by dividing it by 2.
Then it adds the value to the variable sum.

After the loop finishes, it prints the value of the variable sum divided by 2.

The output is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s=sc.next();
        int[] a= new int[26];
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
        	a[s.charAt(i)-'a']++;
        }
        for(int i=0; i<26; i++) {
        	sum+=a[i]%2;
        }//各文字2ずつ入ってれば良いから1つしかない文字をカウント
        System.out.println(sum/2);//cpcみたいなの以外は各文字2つになるようにする。
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```hcpc
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
