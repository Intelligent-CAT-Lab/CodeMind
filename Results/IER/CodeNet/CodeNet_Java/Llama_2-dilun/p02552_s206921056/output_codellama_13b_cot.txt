The variable i is initialized with 1 according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable i is 1. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to 0.
It prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int i = sc.nextInt();
		int ans = 1;
		if (i == 1) {
			ans = 0;
		}

		System.out.println(ans);

	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
