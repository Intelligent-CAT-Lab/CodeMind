The variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable A is greater than 9 or the value of variable B is greater than 9. If it is, it prints -1 as output.
Otherwise, it prints the product of variable A and variable B as output.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
