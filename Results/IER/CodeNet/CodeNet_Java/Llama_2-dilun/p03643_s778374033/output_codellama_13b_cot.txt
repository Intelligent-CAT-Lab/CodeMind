The variable n is initialized with 100.
It prints the string "ABC"+n.
The output is "ABC100".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=scan.nextInt();
		System.out.println("ABC"+n);

	}

}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
