The variable n is initialized with 7.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to 7 to calculate the value of dp[i] for each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[i] by adding the value of dp[i - j] and dp[i] and then modulo 1000000007.
After the loop finishes, it print the value of dp[7], which is 1.

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
