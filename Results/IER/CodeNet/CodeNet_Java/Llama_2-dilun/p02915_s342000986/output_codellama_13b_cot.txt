The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It calculates the value of a as Math.pow((double)n,3).
It prints the value of a as output, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		sc.close();
double a=Math.pow((double)n,3);
			System.out.println((int)a);

	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
