The variable s is initialized with the input string "125".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 125 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable dx.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 125-1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable start.
Then it calculates the value of variable cur by extracting the substring of variable s from start to start+dx+1.
It calculates the value of variable ans by multiplying the value of variable cur with the value of variable helper(start) and helper(s.length()-1-dx-start).
The value of variable helper(start) is calculated by repeatedly extracting the digits of variable start with a while loop and adding it to variable helper(start).
The value of variable helper(s.length()-1-dx-start) is calculated by repeatedly extracting the digits of variable s.length()-1-dx-start with a while loop and adding it to variable helper(s.length()-1-dx-start).
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 125.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        long ans = 0;
        for(int dx=0;dx<=s.length()-1;dx++){
            for(int start=0;start<=s.length()-1-dx;start++){
                long cur = Long.parseLong(s.substring(start,start+dx+1));
                ans += cur*(helper(start)*helper(s.length()-1-dx-start));
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
    static long helper(int n){
        if(n==0) return 1;
        return 1<<(n-1);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```125
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
