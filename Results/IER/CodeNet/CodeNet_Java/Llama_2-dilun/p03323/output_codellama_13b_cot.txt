The variable a and variable b are initialized with 5 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable a is less than or equal to 8 and the value of variable b is less than or equal to 8.
If the condition is met, it prints "Yay!". Otherwise, it prints ":(".
<<<Output>>>
Yay!

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);		
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		if (a <= 8 && b <= 8) {
			System.out.println("Yay!");
		} else {
			System.out.println(":(");
		}
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
