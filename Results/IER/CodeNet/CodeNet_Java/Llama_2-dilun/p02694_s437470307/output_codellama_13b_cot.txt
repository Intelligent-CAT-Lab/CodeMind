The variable X is initialized with 103.
The variable P is initialized with 100.
The variable cnt is initialized with 0.

The while loop iterates until P is greater than X.
The value of P is added to itself and divided by 100.
The value of cnt is incremented by 1.

After the loop finishes, the value of cnt is printed as output, which is 2.

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long X = sc.nextLong();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```103
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
