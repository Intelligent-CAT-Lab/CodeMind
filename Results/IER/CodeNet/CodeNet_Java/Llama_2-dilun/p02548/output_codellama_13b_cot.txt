The variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable cnt.
It checks if the calculated variable cnt is less than n. If it is, it adds BigInteger.ONE to variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
				if (i!= j) {
					sum += arr[i] * arr[j];
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 2 3 4 5```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the variable sum with 0.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i and the current interger j by multiplying them and adds it to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120
