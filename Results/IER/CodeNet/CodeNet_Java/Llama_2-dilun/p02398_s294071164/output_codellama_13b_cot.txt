The variable a, b and c are initialized with 5, 14 and 80 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 5 to 14 to check each integer a in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the remainder of variable c divided by variable a. If the remainder is 0, it increments the variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[]args)throws IOException{
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        String[] str = br.readLine().split(" ");
        int a = Integer.parseInt(str[0]);
        int b = Integer.parseInt(str[1]);
        int c = Integer.parseInt(str[2]);
        int count = 0;

        for(; a <= b; a++){
            if( c % a == 0 )count++;
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 14 80
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
