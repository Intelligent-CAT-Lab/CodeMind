The variable a is initialized with 1.
It checks if the value of variable a is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "Hello World" as output.
Otherwise, it initializes the variable b and c with the next two integers read from the input.
Then it prints the sum of variable b and c as output.
<<<Output>>>
Hello World

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a=scan.nextInt();
		if(a==1) {
			System.out.println("Hello World");
		}
		else {
			int b=scan.nextInt();
			int c=scan.nextInt();
			System.out.println(b+c);
		}
		}
	}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
