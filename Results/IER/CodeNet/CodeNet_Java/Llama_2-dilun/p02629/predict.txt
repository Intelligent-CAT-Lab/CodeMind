The variable N is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable x and variable y.
The value of variable x is calculated by dividing the value of variable N by 26.
The value of variable y is calculated by extracting the remainder of the division of variable N by 26.
Then it checks if the value of variable x is 0. If it is, it breaks the loop.
If the value of variable x is not 0, it calculates the value of variable N by subtracting 1 from the value of variable N.
Then it calculates the value of variable x by dividing the value of variable N by 26.
It checks if the value of variable x is 0. If it is, it breaks the loop.
If the value of variable x is not 0, it calculates the value of variable N by subtracting 1 from the value of variable N.
It checks if the value of variable x is 0. If it is, it breaks the loop.
If the value of variable x is not 0, it calculates the value of variable N by subtracting 1 from the value of variable N.
It checks if the value of variable x is 0. If it is, it breaks the loop.
If the value of variable x is not 0, it calculates the value of variable N by subtracting 1 from the value of variable N.
It checks if the value of variable x is 0. If it is, it breaks the loop.
If the value of variable x is not 0, it calculates the value of variable N by subtracting 1 from the value of variable N.
It checks if the value of variable x is 0. If it is, it breaks the loop.
If the value of variable x is not 0, it calculates the value of variable N by subtracting 1 from the value of variable N.
It checks if the value of variable x is 0. If it is, it breaks the loop.
