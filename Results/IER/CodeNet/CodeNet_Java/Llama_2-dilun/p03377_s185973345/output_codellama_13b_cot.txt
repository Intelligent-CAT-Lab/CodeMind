The variable A, B and C are initialized with 3, 5 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if A is greater than C or A + B is less than C.
If it is true, it prints "NO" as output.
If it is false, it prints "YES" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int A = sc.nextInt();
		int B = sc.nextInt();
		int C = sc.nextInt();
		
		if (A > C || A + B < C) {
			System.out.println("NO");
		} else {
			System.out.println("YES");
		}
		
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
