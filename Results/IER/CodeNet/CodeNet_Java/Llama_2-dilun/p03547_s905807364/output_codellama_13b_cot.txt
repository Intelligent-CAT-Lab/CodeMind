The variable A and variable B are initialized with the first character of the first line and the first character of the second line respectively.
Then it checks if the value of variable A is equal to the value of variable B. If it is, it prints the symbol '=' as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable A is greater than the value of variable B. If it is, it prints the symbol '>' as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable A is less than the value of variable B. If it is, it prints the symbol '<' as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int A = sc.nextInt();
		int B = sc.nextInt();
		int ans = 0;
		if(A == B) {
			ans = '=';
		} else if(A > B) {
			ans = '>';
		} else if(A <B) {
			ans = '<';
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```A B
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
