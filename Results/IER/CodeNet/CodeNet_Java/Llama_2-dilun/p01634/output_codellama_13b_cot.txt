The variable c1, c2 and c3 are initialized with 0.
It iterates through the input line and checks if the current character is a digit. If it is, it increments the value of variable c1.
It iterates through the input line and checks if the current character is a letter. If it is, it increments the value of variable c2.
It iterates through the input line and checks if the current character is a special character. If it is, it increments the value of variable c3.
It checks if the value of variable c1 is greater than 0, the value of variable c2 is greater than 0 and the value of variable c3 is greater than 0.
If it is, it prints "VALID". Otherwise, it prints "INVALID".

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```password
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
