The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 10, 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the maximum value of variable a and variable b by using the min function.
It calculates the minimum value of variable a and variable b by using the min function.
It checks if the sum of variable a and variable b is greater than or equal to variable n. If it is, it calculates the difference between variable a and variable b and variable n.
It prints the maximum value and the minimum value.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] $) {

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
