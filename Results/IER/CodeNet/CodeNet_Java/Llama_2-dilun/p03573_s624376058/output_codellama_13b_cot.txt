The variable A, B and C are initialized with 5, 7 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable A is equal to the value of variable B. If it is, it prints the value of variable C.
It checks if the value of variable A is equal to the value of variable C. If it is, it prints the value of variable B.
It checks if the value of variable A is equal to the value of variable B. If it is, it prints the value of variable A.

The condition is met when A=B=C=5.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
    
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        int C = sc.nextInt();

        if(A==B){
            System.out.println(C);
        }else if(A==C){
            System.out.println(B);    
        }else{
            System.out.println(A);    
    }         
}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
