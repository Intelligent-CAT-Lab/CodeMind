The variable str is initialized with the input string "needed".
The variable size is initialized with the length of the input string.
The variable i is initialized with 1.

The for loop iterates from 1 to size - 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character at index i is equal to the character at index i - 1.
If it is, it prints the index i and the index i + 1.

The for loop iterates from 2 to size - 2.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character at index i is equal to the character at index i - 2.
If it is, it prints the index i - 1 and the index i + 1.
