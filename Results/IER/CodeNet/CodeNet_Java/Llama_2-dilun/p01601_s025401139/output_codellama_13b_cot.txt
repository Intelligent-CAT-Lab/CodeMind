The variable n is initialized with 13 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the input is empty.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the reverse of the input string and stores it in variable rev.
It also calculates the reverse of the input string and stores it in variable str.
Then it compares the two strings and if they are equal, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it increments variable a and decrements variable b.
It then calculates the reverse of the input string and stores it in variable str.
It also calculates the reverse of the input string and stores it in variable rev.
