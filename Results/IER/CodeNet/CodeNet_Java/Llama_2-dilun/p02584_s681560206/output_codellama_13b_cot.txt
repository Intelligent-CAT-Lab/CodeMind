The variable X is initialized with 6, the variable K is initialized with 2 and the variable D is initialized with 4.
It calculates the absolute value of variable X.
It checks if the absolute value of variable K is less than or equal to the absolute value of variable X divided by the absolute value of variable D.
If it is, it calculates the absolute value of variable X minus the absolute value of variable D multiplied by variable K.
Otherwise, it subtracts the absolute value of variable X divided by the absolute value of variable D from variable K.
It checks if the absolute value of variable X divided by the absolute value of variable D is less than or equal to the absolute value of variable X divided by the absolute value of variable D minus the absolute value of variable D.
If it is, it checks if the remainder of variable X divided by the absolute value of variable D is even or odd.
If it is even, it sets the value of variable ans to the absolute value of variable X divided by the absolute value of variable D.
Otherwise, it sets the value of variable ans to the absolute value of variable X divided by the absolute value of variable D minus the absolute value of variable D.
Otherwise, it checks if the absolute value of variable X divided by the absolute value of variable D is less than the absolute value of variable X divided by the absolute value of variable D minus the absolute value of variable D.
If it is, it checks if the remainder of variable X divided by the absolute value of variable D is less than or equal to the absolute value of variable X divided by the absolute value of variable D minus the absolute value of variable D.
If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to the absolute value of variable X divided by the absolute value of variable D.
Otherwise, it sets the value of variable ans to the absolute value of variable X divided by the absolute value of variable D minus the absolute value of variable D.
Otherwise, it sets the value of variable ans to the absolute value of variable X divided by the absolute value of variable D.
It prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 2.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
