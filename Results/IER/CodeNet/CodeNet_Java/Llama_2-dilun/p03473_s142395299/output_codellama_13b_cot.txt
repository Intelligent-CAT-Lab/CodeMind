The variable a is initialized with 21 according to the input.
It prints the output 27.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		//BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		//String line = br.readLine();
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

	    int a = scan.nextInt();
	    
	        System.out.println(48-a);


	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```21
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
