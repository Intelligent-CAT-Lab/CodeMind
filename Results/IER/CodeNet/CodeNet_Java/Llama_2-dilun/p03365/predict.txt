The variable i is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range.
The value of variable i is also passed to variable m.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable m by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable m.
Then it calculates the value of variable cur by multiplying the value of variable m with the value of variable fact(i - m - 1) and then multiplying it with the value of variable md[m] and then modulo it with the value of variable _m.
Then it calculates the value of variable prev by multiplying the value of variable cur with the value of variable ifact[m] and then modulo it with the value of variable _m.
Then it calculates the value of variable res by adding the value of variable cur with the value of variable prev and then modulo it with the value of variable _m.
Then it calculates the value of variable m by subtracting 2 from the value of variable m.
Then it calculates the value of variable lx by subtracting 2 from the value of variable m.
Then it calculates the value of variable rm by subtracting 2 from the value of variable m.
Then it calculates the value of variable res by adding the value of variable cur with the value of variable prev and then modulo it with the value of variable _m.
