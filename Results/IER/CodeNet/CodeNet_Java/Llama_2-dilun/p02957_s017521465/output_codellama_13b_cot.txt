The variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 16 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the difference of variable a and variable b is even or odd.
If it is even, it calculates the average of variable a and variable b and prints it.
If it is odd, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
	public class Main {
		public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
        if((a-b)%2==0){
         System.out.println((a+b)/2);
        }
        else{
          System.out.println("IMPOSSIBLE");
        }
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 16
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
