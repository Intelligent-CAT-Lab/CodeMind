The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable d by multiplying variable i with variable d.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable d as output, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        
           long n = scan.nextLong();
           long i ;
           long d = 1;
           
           for(i = 1; i<=n;i++){
               d = d * i;
           }
           System.out.println(d);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
