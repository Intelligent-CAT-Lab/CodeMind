    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println(sc.nextInt()*sc.nextInt());
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
