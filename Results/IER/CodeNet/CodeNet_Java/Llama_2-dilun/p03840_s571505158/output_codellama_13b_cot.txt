The variable I, variable O, variable T, variable J, variable L and variable S are initialized with 2, 1, 1, 0, 0 and 0 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable ans by multiplying the value of variable I by 2 and adding the value of variable J by 2 and the value of variable L by 2.
It checks if the value of variable J is greater than 0 and the value of variable L is greater than 0 and the value of variable I is greater than 0. If it does, it calculates the value of variable ans by subtracting 1 from the value of variable I and multiplying the result by 2 and adding 3 to the result and subtracting 1 from the value of variable J and multiplying the result by 2 and subtracting 1 from the value of variable L and multiplying the result by 2.
It adds the value of variable O to the value of variable ans.
The final value of variable ans is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    long I = sc.nextInt();
    long O = sc.nextInt();
    long T = sc.nextInt();
    long J = sc.nextInt();
    long L = sc.nextInt();
    long S = sc.nextInt();
    long Z = sc.nextInt();
    long ans = I / 2 * 2 + J / 2 * 2 + L / 2 * 2;
    if (J > 0 && L > 0 & I > 0) {
      ans = Math.max(ans, (I - 1) / 2 * 2 + 3 + (J - 1) / 2 * 2 + (L - 1) / 2 * 2);
    }

    ans += O;
    System.out.println(ans);
  }

}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1 1 0 0 0 0
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
