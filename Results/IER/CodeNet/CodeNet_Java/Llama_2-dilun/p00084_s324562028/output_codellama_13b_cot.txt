The input is split into a list of strings by the split method of the Scanner class.
Then it iterates through the list of strings and checks if each string is of length 3 to 6.
If it is, it adds the string to the string s.
Finally, it prints the string s with the replaceAll method of the String class.
<<<Output>>>
Rain, rain, go to Spain.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;class Main{public static void main(String[]z){String s="";for(String x:new Scanner(System.in).nextLine().split("[.,]"))if(x.matches(".{3,6}"))s+=x+" ";System.out.println(s.replaceAll(" $",""));}}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```Rain, rain, go to Spain.
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
