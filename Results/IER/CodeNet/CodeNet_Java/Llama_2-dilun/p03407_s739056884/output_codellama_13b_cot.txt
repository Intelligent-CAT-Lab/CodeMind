<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, b and c are initialized with 50, 100 and 120 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable a + b is greater than or equal to the value of variable c.
Since 50 + 100 is 150 and 150 is greater than or equal to 120, the condition is met and the output is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		if (a + b >= c) {
			System.out.println("Yes");
		}else {
			System.out.println("No");
		}
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```50 100 120
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
