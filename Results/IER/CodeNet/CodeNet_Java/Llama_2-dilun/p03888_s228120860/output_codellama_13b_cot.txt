The variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the product of a and b, which is 6.
It calculates the quotient of 6 and (a+b), which is 0.6.
It prints the output 0.6.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner d = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = d.nextInt();
		int b = d.nextInt();
		double c;
		c=(a*b*1.0/(a+b));
		System.out.println(c);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
