The code is a palindrome checker.
It first checks if the first two characters are the same. If they are, it checks if the third character is the same as the second. If it is, it prints "Yes" and returns.
If the first two characters are not the same, it checks if the third character is the same as the second. If it is, it prints "Yes" and returns.
If the first two characters are not the same and the third character is not the same as the second, it prints "No" and returns.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{

  public static void main(String[] args){
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      String s = sc.next();
      for(int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if(s.charAt(i)!= s.charAt(i-1))
          break;
        if(i == 2) {
          System.out.println("Yes");
          return;
        }
      }
      for(int i = 2; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if(s.charAt(i)!= s.charAt(i-1))
          break;
        if(i == 3) {
          System.out.println("Yes");
          return;
        }
      }
      System.out.println("No");
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1118
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
