The variable w is initialized with 25.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until w is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the remainder of w divided by 3.
If the remainder is 0, it adds 0 to the string ans.
If the remainder is 1, it adds + to the string ans.
If the remainder is 2, it adds - to the string ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the string ans as output, which is -.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int w = scan.nextInt();
		String ans = "";
		
		while(w!= 0) {
			int tmp = w % 3;
			
			if(tmp == 0) {
				ans = "0" + ans;
				w /= 3;
				
			} else if(tmp == 1) {
				ans = "+" + ans;
				w /= 3;
				
			} else if(tmp == 2) {
				ans = "-" + ans;
				w /= 3;
				w++;
			}
		}
		
		System.out.println(ans);
		
		scan.close();
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```25
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
