The variable height is initialized with 1 and variable width is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer common in this range. The value of variable common is also passed to variable common.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the following four factors:
1. The factorial of variable height
2. The inverse of the factorial of variable common
3. The factorial of variable width
4. The inverse of the factorial of variable height - variable common
