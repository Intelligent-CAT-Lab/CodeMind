The variable c is initialized with the first character of the input string.
Then it iterates through the input string and checks if the current character is different from the current value of variable c. If it is, it increments the variable sum by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable sum as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String s=sc.next();
		char c=s.charAt(0);
		int sum=0;
		for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
			if(c!=s.charAt(i)){
				sum++;
				c=s.charAt(i);
			}
		}
		System.out.print(sum);
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```BBBWW
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
