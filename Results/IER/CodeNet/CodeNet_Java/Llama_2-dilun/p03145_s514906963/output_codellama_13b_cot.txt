The variable ab, bc and ca are initialized with 3, 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The variable cal is initialized with 0.
It calculates the value of variable cal by multiplying the value of variable ab and variable bc and then dividing the result by 2.
It prints the value of variable cal as output, which is 15.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        
        Scanner sc =new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int ab = sc.nextInt();
        int bc = sc.nextInt();
        int ca = sc.nextInt();
        int cal = (ab * bc) /2;

        System.out.println(cal);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
