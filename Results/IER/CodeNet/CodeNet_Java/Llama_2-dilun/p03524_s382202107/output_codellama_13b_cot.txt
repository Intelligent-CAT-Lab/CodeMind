The variable cs is initialized with the input string "abac".
Then it iterates through the string and extracts the current character and stores it in variable cs.
Then it calculates the frequency of each character in the string by incrementing the corresponding element in the array count.
Then it checks if the absolute difference between the frequency of the first character and the second character is less than or equal to 1, and the absolute difference between the frequency of the first character and the third character is less than or equal to 1, and the absolute difference between the frequency of the second character and the third character is less than or equal to 1.
If it is true, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = in.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = in.nextInt();

		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			sum += arr[i];

		System.out.println(sum);
		in.close();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 2 3 4```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized with 3.
Then it initializes the array arr with 3 elements.
Then it iterates through the array and stores the input values in the array.
Then it iterates through the array and calculates the sum of the elements in the array.
Then it prints the sum as output.
