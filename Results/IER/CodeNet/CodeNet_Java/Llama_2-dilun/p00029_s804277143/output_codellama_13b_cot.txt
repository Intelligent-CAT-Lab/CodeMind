The code first splits the input into an array of strings.
Then it iterates through the array of strings and checks if the string is already in the HashMap.
If it is not, it adds the string to the HashMap with a value of 1.
If it is already in the HashMap, it increments the value of the string in the HashMap.
After the loop finishes, it finds the string with the maximum value in the HashMap and prints it.
It also finds the string with the maximum length in the HashMap and prints it.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code first reads the input and stores it in an array of integers.
Then it iterates through the array and adds the value of each integer to a variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable sum.
