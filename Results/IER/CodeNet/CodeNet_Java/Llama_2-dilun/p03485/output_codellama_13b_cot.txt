The variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calls the function solve(a, b) to calculate the output.
The function solve(a, b) calculates the output by adding a and b and then dividing the result by 2.
The output is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        System.out.println(solve(a, b));

        sc.close();
    }

    static int solve(int a, int b) {
        return (a + b + 1) / 2;
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
