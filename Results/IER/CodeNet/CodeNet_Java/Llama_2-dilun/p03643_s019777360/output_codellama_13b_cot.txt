The variable num is initialized with 100.
It prints the string "ABC"+num.
The output is "ABC100".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int num = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println("ABC"+num);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
