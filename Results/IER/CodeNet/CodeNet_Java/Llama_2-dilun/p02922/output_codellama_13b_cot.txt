The variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the quotient ans of variable b divided by variable a.
It checks if the remainder of the division is 0. If it is, it prints the quotient ans.
Otherwise, it prints the quotient ans plus 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
    
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();

    int ans = (b-1)/(a-1);
    if((b-1)%(a-1)==0) {
    	System.out.println(ans);
    }else {
    	System.out.println(ans+1);
    }
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
