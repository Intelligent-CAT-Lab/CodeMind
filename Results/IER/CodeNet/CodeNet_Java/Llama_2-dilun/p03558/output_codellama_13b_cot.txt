The input is 6.
The code first initializes the variables parent, rank and num with 6, 0 and 1 respectively.
Then it iterates from 1 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
It calculates the root of variable x by repeatedly calling the function root(x) until the value of variable parent[x] is equal to x.
It then checks if the root of variable x is equal to the root of variable y. If it does, it returns false.
Otherwise, it checks if the rank of the root of variable x is less than the rank of the root of variable y. If it is, it sets the value of variable parent[x] to y and the value of variable num[y] to the sum of the value of variable num[x] and the value of variable num[y].
Otherwise, it sets the value of variable parent[y] to x and the value of variable num[x] to the sum of the value of variable num[x] and the value of variable num[y].
It also increments the value of variable rank[x] if the rank of the root of variable x is equal to the rank of the root of variable y.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable num[x] as output, which is 12.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();

            for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
                arr[i][j] = sc.nextInt();
            }
        }
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];

The input is 4.
The code first initializes the array arr with 4 rows and 4 columns.
It then iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
It iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable k.
It iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable l.
It iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer l in this range. The value of variable l is also passed to variable m.
It iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer m in this range. The value of variable m is also passed to variable n.
It iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer n in this range. The value of variable n is also passed to variable o.
It iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer o in this range. The value of variable o is also passed to variable p.
