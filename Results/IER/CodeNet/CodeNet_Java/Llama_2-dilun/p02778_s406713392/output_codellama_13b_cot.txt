The variable S is initialized with the input string "sardine".
The variable Length is initialized with the length of the input string, which is 7.
The variable tmp is initialized with a new char array of length 7.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 6 and assigns the value 'x' to each element of the array tmp.
The output is the array tmp, which is:
```x x x x x x x```
<<<Output>>>
x x x x x x x

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String S = sc.next();
		int Length=S.length();
      	char tmp[];
      	tmp =new char[Length];
      	for(int i=0 ;i<Length;i++)
        {
          	tmp[i]='x';
        }
      	System.out.println(tmp);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```sardine
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
