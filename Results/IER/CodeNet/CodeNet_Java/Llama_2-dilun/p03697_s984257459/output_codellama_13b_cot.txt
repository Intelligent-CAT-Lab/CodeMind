The variable a and variable b are initialized with 6 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of a and b is less than 10. If it is, it prints the sum of a and b. Otherwise, it prints "error".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();

		if (a + b < 10) {
			System.out.print(a + b);
		} else {
			System.out.print("error");
		}

	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
