The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 2 and 9 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 9]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4 and 9.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
14

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    solve(System.in, System.out);
  }

  static void solve(InputStream is, PrintStream os) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(is);

    /* read */
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    os.println(Math.min(a * n, b));
  }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 9
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
