    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000 3000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
