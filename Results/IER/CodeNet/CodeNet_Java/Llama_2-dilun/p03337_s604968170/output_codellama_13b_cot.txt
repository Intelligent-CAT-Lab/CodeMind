The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the sum of the two numbers, the difference of the two numbers and the product of the two numbers.
It checks if the sum is greater than the difference and greater than the product. If it is, it prints the sum.
If the difference is greater than the sum and greater than the product, it prints the difference.
If the product is greater than the sum and greater than the difference, it prints the product.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner in = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
		int a = in.nextInt();
		int b = in.nextInt();
		
		int add = a+b;
		int sub = a-b;
		int p = a*b;
		if(add >= sub && add >= p) {
			System.out.print(add);
		}else if (sub >= add && sub >= p) {
			System.out.print(sub);
		}else {
			System.out.print(p);

		System.out.print("");
	
		in.close();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
