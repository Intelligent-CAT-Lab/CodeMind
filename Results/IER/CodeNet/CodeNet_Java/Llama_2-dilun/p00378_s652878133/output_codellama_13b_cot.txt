The variable A, variable B and variable X are initialized with 180, 100 and 2400 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2400 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable X.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [100, 180]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 180.

		int A, B, X;
		StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```180 100 2400
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
