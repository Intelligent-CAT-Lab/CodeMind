The variable k, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 2 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the condition B-A<=2 is met. If it is, it prints 1+k as output.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable kk by subtracting k from the difference of A and 1.
Then it calculates the value of variable ans by dividing kk by 2 and multiplying it with the difference of B and A.
It adds 1 to the value of ans if the remainder of kk is not 0.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
     
      Scanner in =new Scanner(System.in);
      int k=in.nextInt();
      int A=in.nextInt();
      int B=in.nextInt();
      
      if  (B-A<=2) System.out.println(1+k);
      else{
        long kk=k-(A-1);
        long ans=kk/2*(B-A)+A;
        if (kk%2!=0)ans++;
        System.out.println(ans);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
