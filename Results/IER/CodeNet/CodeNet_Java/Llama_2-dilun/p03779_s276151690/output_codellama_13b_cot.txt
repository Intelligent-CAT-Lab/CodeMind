The variable n is initialized with 6.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 1 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable x.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x as output, which is 28.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		long n=sc.nextLong();
		long x=0;
		long i=1;
		while(x<n)
		{
			x+=i;
			i++;
		}
		System.out.println(i-1);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
