The variable x and variable y are initialized with 3 and 8 respectively according to the input.
It checks if x*2 <= y and x*4 >= y. The condition is met when x = 2 and y = 8.
Then it checks if y is even. The condition is met when y = 8.
It prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int x = sc.nextInt();
    int y = sc.nextInt();
    
    if ( x*2 <= y && x*4 >= y ) {
      if ( y % 2 == 0 ) {
        System.out.println("Yes");
        return;
      }
    } 
    
    System.out.println("No");
  }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
