The variable A and B are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger A by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable c.
Then it checks if the calculated variable A is greater than variable B. If it is, it adds the current interger A to variable c.
Otherwise, it adds the current interger B to variable c.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable c as output, which is 8.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*; 
class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
       int A = sc.nextInt();
       int B = sc.nextInt();
       int c = 0;
     
      for(int i = 0;i<2;i++){
       if(A>=B){c += A;A = A -1;}
        else{c += B;B = B -1;}
      }
       
     
     
     System.out.print(c);


   }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
