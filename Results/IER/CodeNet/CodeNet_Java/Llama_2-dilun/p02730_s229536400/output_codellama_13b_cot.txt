The variable S is initialized with the input string "akasaka".
The variable anskey is initialized with false.
The variable L is initialized with the length of the input string minus 1.
The variable N is initialized with the length of the input string.
The variable i is initialized with 0.
The variable key is initialized with true.

The for loop iterates from 0 to N/2 to check each character in the input string.
If the character at index i is not equal to the character at index L, the variable key is set to false and the for loop breaks.
The variable L is decremented by 1.

After the for loop finishes, the variable key is checked. If it is true, the variable anskey is set to true.

The output is "Yes".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class Main {
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    String S = sc.next();
    boolean anskey = false;
    if (check(S) 
    		&& check(S.substring(0,(S.length()-1)/2)) 
    		&& check(S.substring(((S.length()+3)/2) - 1))) {
    	anskey = true;
    }
    System.out.println(anskey? "Yes" : "No");
  }
  
  public static boolean check(String s) {
	  boolean key = true;
	  int N = s.length();
	  int L = N - 1;
	  for (int i = 0; i < N/2; i++) {
		  if (s.charAt(i)!= s.charAt(L)) {
			  key = false;
			  break;

		  L--;

	  return key;

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```akasaka
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
