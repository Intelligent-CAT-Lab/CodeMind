The variable coins is initialized with 2*500 = 1000.
The variable sc is used to read the input.
The variable sc.nextInt() is used to read the first integer, which is 900.
The variable coins is multiplied by 500 to get 1000.
The variable sc.nextInt() is used to read the second integer, which is 1000.
The condition is checked if the value of variable coins is greater than or equal to the value of variable sc.nextInt().
If the condition is met, the output is "Yes".
If the condition is not met, the output is "No".

import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 900
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
