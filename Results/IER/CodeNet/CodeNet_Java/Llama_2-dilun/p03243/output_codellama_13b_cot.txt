The variable n is initialized with 111 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 111 to 1000 to check each integer i in this range.
The condition is met when i is 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, 999.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable i, which is 111.
<<<Output>>>
111

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        for (int i = n; i < 1000; i++) {
            if (i % 111 == 0) {
                System.out.println(i);
                return;
            }
        }
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```111
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
