The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable b + a - 1, which is 8.
It calculates the value of variable b / a, which is 2.
It calculates the value of variable b + a - 1 / a, which is 4.
It prints the value of variable b + a - 1 / a as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt(), b = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println((b + a - 1) / a);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
