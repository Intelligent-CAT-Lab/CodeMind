The variable x is initialized with 4 and variable y is initialized with 4.
It calculates the value of variable a as y/(2*x).
It creates a list of point objects and adds a point object to the list.
The point object has x and y initialized with 0.
It iterates from 0 to x and calculates the value of point object p.x as i*2.
It calculates the value of point object p.y as y-(a*(p.x)).
It adds the point object to the list.
It iterates from 0 to y and calculates the value of point object p.y as i.
It calculates the value of point object p.x as (y-p.y)/a.
It checks if the point object is already in the list.
If it is not, it adds the point object to the list.
It prints the size of the list.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized with 4 and variable m is initialized with 4.
It creates a 2D array of size n*m and initializes all elements to 0.
It iterates from 0 to n and iterates from 0 to m.
It calculates the value of element arr[i][j] as the value of input.
It creates a 2D array of size n*m and initializes all elements to 0.
It iterates from 0 to n and iterates from 0 to m.
It calculates the value of element dp[i][j] as 1 if arr[i][j] is 0.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of element dp[i][j] as the maximum of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1].
It iterates from 0 to n and iterates from 0 to m.
It prints the value of element dp[i][j] as output.
