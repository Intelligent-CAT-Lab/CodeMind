The variable membersCount is initialized with 4, trainFee with 2 and taxiFee with 9.
It checks if the condition (membersCount*trainFee>=taxiFee) is met. If it is, it prints the value of taxiFee as output. Otherwise, it prints the value of membersCount*trainFee as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main { 
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String[] line = sc.nextLine().split(" ");
		int membersCount = Integer.parseInt(line[0]);
		int trainFee = Integer.parseInt(line[1]);
		int taxiFee = Integer.parseInt(line[2]);
		int result = 0;
		if(membersCount*trainFee>=taxiFee) {
			result = taxiFee;
		}else {
			result = membersCount*trainFee;
		}
		System.out.println(result);
		
		
		
		
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 9
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
