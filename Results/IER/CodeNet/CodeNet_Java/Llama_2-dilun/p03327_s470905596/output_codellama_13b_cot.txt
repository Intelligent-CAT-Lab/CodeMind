The variable n is initialized with 999.
It checks if the value of variable n is greater than 999. If it is, it prints "ABD" as output. Otherwise, it prints "ABC" as output.
<<<Output>>>
ABC

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

    private static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        if (n > 999) {
            System.out.println("ABD");
        } else {
            System.out.println("ABC");
        }
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```999
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
