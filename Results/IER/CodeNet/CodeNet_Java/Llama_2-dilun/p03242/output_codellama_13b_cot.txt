The input is a string of length 3.
The first character is '1', the second character is '1' and the third character is '9'.
The first character is converted to '9' and the second character is converted to '1'.
The output is "911".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    char[] S = sc.next().toCharArray();
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) S[i] = (S[i] == '1')? '9' : '1';
    System.out.println(S);
  }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```119
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
