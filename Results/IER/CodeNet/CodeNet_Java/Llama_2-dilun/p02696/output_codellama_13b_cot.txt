The variable a, b and n are initialized with 5, 7 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable n is greater than or equal to variable b. If it is, it prints the value of a multiplied by (b-1)/b. Otherwise, it prints the value of a multiplied by n/b.
The condition is met when n is 7.
The output is 5*6/7.
<<<Output>>>
5*6/7

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long a=sc.nextLong();
		long b=sc.nextLong();
		long n=sc.nextLong();
		if(n>=b){
			System.out.println(a*(b-1)/b);
		}else{
			System.out.println(a*n/b);
		}
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
