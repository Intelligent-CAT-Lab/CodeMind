The variable X is initialized with 1024.
It calculates the value of variable gohyaku by dividing X by 500.
It calculates the value of variable goen by dividing X by 5.
It prints the value of 1000*gohyaku+5*goen, which is 1000*20+5*4, which is 1004.
<<<Output>>>
1004

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[]args) {
		try(Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in)){
			
			int X = scan.nextInt();
			
			int gohyaku = X/500;
			
			X = X-500*gohyaku;
			
			int goen = X/5;
			
			
			System.out.println(1000*gohyaku+5*goen);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1024
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
