The variable S and variable c are initialized with 1 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable ans by comparing the value of variable S with the value of variable c/2.
If the value of variable S is greater than or equal to the value of variable c/2, it sets the value of variable ans to the value of variable c/2.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable ans by adding the value of variable S to the value of variable c/2 minus the value of variable S divided by 2.
After the calculation, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		long S = sc.nextLong();
		long c = sc.nextLong();
		long ans = 0;
		if( S>=c/2 ){
			ans = c/2;
		}else{
			ans = S + (c/2-S)/2;
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
