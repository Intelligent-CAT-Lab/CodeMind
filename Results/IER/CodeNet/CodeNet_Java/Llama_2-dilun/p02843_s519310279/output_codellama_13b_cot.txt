The variable num is initialized with 615.
The variable stack_item is initialized with 615/100, which is 6.
The variable diff is initialized with 615 - 6 * 100, which is 15.
The variable pos is initialized with false.

If the condition diff <= stack_item*5 is met, then pos is set to true.

If the condition is met, then the output is 1.

If the condition is not met, then the output is 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

  		int num = sc.nextInt(); 
      	int stack_item = num/100;
      	int diff = num - stack_item * 100;
      	boolean pos = false;
      
      	if(diff <= stack_item*5) pos = true;
      	
      	if(pos) System.out.println("1");
      	else System.out.println("0");

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```615
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
