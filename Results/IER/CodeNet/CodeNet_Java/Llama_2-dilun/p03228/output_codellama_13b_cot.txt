The variable a and variable b are initialized with 5 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable op is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable op.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger op by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable op.
Then it checks if the calculated variable op falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable a and variable b. The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable a and variable b as output, which is 1 and 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    
	    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	    int a = sc.nextInt();
	    int b = sc.nextInt();
	    int op = sc.nextInt();
	    
	    for(int i=0; i<op; i++){
	        if ( i % 2 == 0 ){ b += a / 2 ; a /= 2 ;}
	        else{
	          a += b / 2 ;
	          b /= 2 ;  
	        } 
	    }
	    System.out.println(a);
	    System.out.println(b);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
