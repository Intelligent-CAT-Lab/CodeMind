The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i*i is less than or equal to n. If it does, it increments the variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count*count, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      	//数値の入力
		long n = sc.nextLong();
      	long count = 0;
      	
        for(long i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        	if(i*i<=n){
              count++;
            }
        }
              System.out.println(count*count);
     }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
