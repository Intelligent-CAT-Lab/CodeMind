The variable prev is initialized with 'A' and the variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and iterates through the input string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is greater than the previous character prev. If it is, it increments the variable count.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        char[] arr = sc.next().toCharArray();
        char prev = 'A';
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : arr) {

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```AIZU
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
