The variable L, R and d are initialized with 5, 10 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 5 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is divisible by 2. If it is, it adds 1 to variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int L = sc.nextInt();
		int R = sc.nextInt();
		int d = sc.nextInt();
		int cnt = 0;
		
		for(int i = L; i <= R; i++) {
			if(i % d == 0) {
				cnt += 1;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(cnt);
		sc.close();
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 10 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
