The variable n is initialized with 8.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until n is 1.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of n by repeatedly adding 3 to n and then dividing it by 3.
It increments the variable count by 1 each time the value of n is calculated.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable count as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
 
 
public class Main{
     
    public static void main(String[] args){
    	
    	final Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    	
    	int n = sc.nextInt();
    	int count = 0;
    	
    	while(n > 1){
    		n  = (n + (n % 3 == 0? 0 : 3 - n % 3)) / 3;
    		count++;

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
