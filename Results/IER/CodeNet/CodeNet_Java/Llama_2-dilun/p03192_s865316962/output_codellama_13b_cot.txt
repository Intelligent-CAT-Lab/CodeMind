The variable N is initialized with the input string "1222".
It checks if the first character of N is "2". If it is, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
It checks if the second character of N is "2". If it is, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
It checks if the third character of N is "2". If it is, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
It checks if the fourth character of N is "2". If it is, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 4.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String N = sc.next();
		int cnt = 0;
		if(N.substring(0, 1).equals("2")) cnt++;
		if(N.substring(1, 2).equals("2")) cnt++;
		if(N.substring(2, 3).equals("2")) cnt++;
		if(N.substring(3, 4).equals("2")) cnt++;
		System.out.println(cnt);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12222
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
