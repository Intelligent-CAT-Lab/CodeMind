The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 6, 4 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if b + c < a. Since b + c = 7 < a = 6, the condition is met and it prints 0 as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
          Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
          int a = sc.nextInt();
          int b = sc.nextInt();
          int c = sc.nextInt();
          if(b + c < a){
              System.out.println(0);
          } else {
            System.out.println(b + c - a);
          }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 4 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
