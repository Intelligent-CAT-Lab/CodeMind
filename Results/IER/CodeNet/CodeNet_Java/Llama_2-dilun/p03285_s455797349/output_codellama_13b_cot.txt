The variable N is initialized with 11.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 / 7 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable N.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 / 4 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable N.
It checks if the value of variable N is equal to the value of variable i multiplied by 7 plus the value of variable j multiplied by 4. If it does, it prints "Yes" and returns.
The condition is met when i is 0 and j is 0.
After the loop finishes, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner cin = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = cin.nextInt();

        for (int i = 0; i < 100 / 7; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 100 / 4; j++) {
                if (N == (i * 7) + (j * 4)) {
                    System.out.println("Yes");
                    return;
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println("No");
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
