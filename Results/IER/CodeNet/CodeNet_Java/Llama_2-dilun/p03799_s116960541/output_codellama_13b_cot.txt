The variable N and variable M are initialized with 1 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the product of N and 2, which is 2.
It checks if the product of N and 2 is greater than or equal to M. If it is, it sets the value of variable res to M/2, which is 3.
Otherwise, it calculates the sum of N and the difference of M and 2 times N divided by 4, which is 1+3/4, which is 1.375.
It sets the value of variable res to 1.375.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long N = sc.nextLong();
        long M = sc.nextLong();

        long res = 0;
        
        if(N*2>=M){
            res = M/2;
        }else{
            res = N+((M-2*N)/4);
        }

        
        System.out.println(res);
        
        }
    }
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
