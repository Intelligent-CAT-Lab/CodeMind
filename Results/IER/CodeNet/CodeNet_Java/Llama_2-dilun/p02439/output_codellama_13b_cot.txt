The variable a, b and c are initialized with 4, 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the minimum value of variable a and b, which is 4.
It calculates the maximum value of variable a and b, which is 5.
It calculates the minimum value of variable c and variable min, which is 3.
It calculates the maximum value of variable c and variable max, which is 5.
It prints the minimum value of variable min and variable c, which is 3.
It prints the maximum value of variable max and variable c, which is 5.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int min = Math.min(a,b);
        int max = Math.max(a,b);
        System.out.println(Math.min(min,c)+" "+Math.max(max,c));
    }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
