The variable A, variable B and variable X are initialized with 2, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.

It calculates the value of variable z by dividing the difference between A * A * B and X by A * A * 2.

It calculates the value of variable d by multiplying the value of variable z by 180 and dividing it by the value of Math.PI.

It prints the value of variable d as output.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
