The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the product of n and k is odd or not.
If it is odd, it prints "Yes" as output.
If it is even, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		if((n*k) % 2 == 1) {
			System.out.println("Yes");

		else System.out.println("No");
	}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
