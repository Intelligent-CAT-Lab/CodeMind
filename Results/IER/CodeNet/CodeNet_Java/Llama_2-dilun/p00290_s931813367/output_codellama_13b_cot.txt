The variable a and variable b are initialized with 20 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the product of variable a and variable b by multiplying them.
It prints the value of variable sum as output, which is 400.
<<<Output>>>
400

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a,b,c,sum;
		a = scan.nextInt();
		b = scan.nextInt();
		
		sum = a * b;
		
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
