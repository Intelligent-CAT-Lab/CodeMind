The variable a, b and c are initialized with 3, 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the area of the triangle by multiplying the base and height of the triangle.
The base of the triangle is a*b/2, which is 3*4/2 = 6.
The height of the triangle is c, which is 5.
The area of the triangle is 6*5 = 30.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
/*
 * 直角三角形の面積を求める
 */
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//変数定義
		int a,b,c;

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		a = sc.nextInt();
		b = sc.nextInt();
		c = sc.nextInt();

		System.out.println(a*b/2);

	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
