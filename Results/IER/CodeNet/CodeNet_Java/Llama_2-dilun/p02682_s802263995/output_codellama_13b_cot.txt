The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable k are initialized with 2, 1, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if statement and it checks if the value of variable a is greater than or equal to the value of variable k. If it does, it assigns the value of variable k to variable answer.
Otherwise, it adds the value of variable a to variable answer. Then it subtracts the value of variable k from the value of variable answer.
It then subtracts the value of variable b from the value of variable answer.
Finally, it prints the value of variable answer as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		int d = sc.nextInt();
		int answer = 0;
		if(a>=b) {
			answer=b;
		}
		else {
			answer+=a;
			b=b-a;
			b=b-c;
			answer-=(b*1);
		}
		System.out.println(answer);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1 1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
