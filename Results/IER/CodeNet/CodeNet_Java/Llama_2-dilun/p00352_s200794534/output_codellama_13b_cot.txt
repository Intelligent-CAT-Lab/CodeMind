The variable a and variable b are initialized with 1000 and 3000 respectively according to the input.
Then it calculates the average of variable a and variable b by dividing the sum of variable a and variable b by 2.
It prints the average value as output, which is 2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = scan.nextInt();
        int b = scan.nextInt();
        int hannpenn;
        
        hannpenn=(a+b)/2;
        System.out.println(hannpenn);
        
        }
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000 3000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
