<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable y and variable i are initialized with 9, 45000 and 0 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the input is over.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable y by dividing the input by 1000.
Then it checks if the value of variable y is less than or equal to the value of variable price[0]. If it is, it sets the variable flag to true and prints the value of variable i, variable j and variable need.
Then it checks if the value of variable y is less than or equal to the value of variable price[1]. If it is, it sets the variable flag to true and prints the value of variable i, variable j and variable need.
If the value of variable y is not less than or equal to the value of variable price[0] and the value of variable y is not less than or equal to the value of variable price[1], it sets the variable flag to false and prints the value of variable i, variable j and variable need.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable flag.
