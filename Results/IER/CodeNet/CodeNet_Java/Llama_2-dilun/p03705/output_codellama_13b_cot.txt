The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 4 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the condition a>b is true. If it is, it prints 0 as output and returns.
If the condition is false, it checks if the condition a==b is true. If it is, it prints 1 as output and returns.
If the condition is false, it prints (n-2)*(b-a)+1 as output.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

	public class Main {

		public static void main(String[] args) {

			Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
			
			int n = sc.nextInt();
			int a = sc.nextInt();
			int b = sc.nextInt();
			
			
			if(a>b||(n==1&&a!=b)) {
				System.out.println(0);
				return;

			if(a==b) {
				System.out.println(1);
				return;

			System.out.println((n-2)*(b-a)+1);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 4 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
