The variable N is initialized with the input "hihi".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N.length()-1 to check each character in the string N.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at the current position is 'h' or 'i' and if it is not, it sets the variable hi to false.
After the loop finishes, it print the value of variable hi as output, which is false.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main {
	
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    	String N = sc.next();
    	boolean hi = true;
    	for (int i = 0; i < N.length(); i++) {
    		if ((i%2 == 0 && N.charAt(i)!= 'h') || (i%2 == 1 && N.charAt(i)!= 'i')) {
    			hi = false;
    		} 
    	}
    	System.out.println(hi && N.length()%2 ==0? "Yes" : "No");
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```hihi
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
