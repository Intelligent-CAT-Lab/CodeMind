The variable N is initialized with 15.
The variable a is initialized with the array of integers from 1 to 15.
The variable b is initialized with the array of integers from 15 to 1.
The variable c is initialized with the array of integers from 1 to 15.

The variable c[1] is initialized with the sum of the first two elements of the array a and b.

The variable c[1] is printed as output.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```15
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
