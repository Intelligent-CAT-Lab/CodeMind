The variable W and variable H are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [0, 9]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 45.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

/**

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int W, H;
		char c;

		W = sc.nextInt();
		H = sc.nextInt();
		c = sc.next().charAt(0);

		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

		for (int i = 0; i < H; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < W; j++) {

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3 B
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
