The variable line is initialized with the input string.
The variable sb is initialized with a StringBuilder object.
The variable a is initialized with true.

It iterates through the characters of the input string.
If the current character is 'A' and the variable a is true, it sets the variable a to false.
If the current character is 'Z' and the variable a is false, it appends the string "AZ" to the variable sb.
It sets the variable a to true.

If the variable sb has a non-zero length, it prints the value of the variable sb.
If the variable sb has a zero length, it prints -1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

/**
 * A-Z Cat

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String line;
		String[] words;

		line = br.readLine();

		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
		boolean a = true;

		for (char c : line.toCharArray()) {
			if (c == 'A' && a) {
				a = false;

				sb.append("AZ");
				a = true;

		if (sb.length()!= 0) {

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```AIZUNYANPEROPERO
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
