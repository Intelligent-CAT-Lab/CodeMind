The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the product of a and b is even or odd.
Since 3*4=12 and 12%2=0, the product is even.
So the output is "Even".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    /**
     * @param args the command line arguments
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO code application logic here
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        if(a*b%2==0){
            System.out.println("Even");

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
