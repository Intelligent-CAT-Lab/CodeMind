The variable A, B and K are initialized with 2, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The condition is met when K <= A.
So A is set to 0 and B is set to 3.
The output is 0 3.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
