The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.

It checks if the value of variable A is equal to the value of variable B. If it is, it prints 0 as output.

Otherwise, it checks if the difference between variable A and variable B is even. If it is, it prints the value of variable B/2 as output.

Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable A is less than the value of variable N minus variable B. If it is, it prints the value of variable A+B-1/2 as output.

Otherwise, it prints the value of variable N*2-A-B+1/2 as output.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
