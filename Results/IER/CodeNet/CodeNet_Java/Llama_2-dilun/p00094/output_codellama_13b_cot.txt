The variable sc is initialized with a Scanner object.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the scanner object has no more input.
Inside the while loop, it prints the output of the code.
The output is the result of the following calculation:
(15*25)/3.305785
The result is 10.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		while(sc.hasNext()) System.out.println((sc.nextDouble()*sc.nextDouble())/3.305785);
	}	
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```15 25
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
