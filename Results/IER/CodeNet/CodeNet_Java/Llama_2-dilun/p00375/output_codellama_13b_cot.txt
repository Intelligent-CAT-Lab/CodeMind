The variable a is initialized with 68 according to the input.
It prints the value of variable a - 30 divided by 2, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
14

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main
{

    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();

        System.out.println((a - 30) / 2);
    }

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```68
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
