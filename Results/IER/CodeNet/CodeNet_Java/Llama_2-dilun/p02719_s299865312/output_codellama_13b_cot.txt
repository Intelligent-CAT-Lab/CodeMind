The variable n and variable k are initialized with 7 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the remainder of n divided by k, which is 3.
It initializes variable num2 with the absolute value of 3, which is 3.
It calculates the minimum value between variable ans and variable num2, which is 3.
It checks if the remainder of n divided by k is less than 0, which is false.
It calculates the remainder of 3 divided by k, which is 1.
It initializes variable num2 with the absolute value of 1, which is 1.
It calculates the minimum value between variable ans and variable num2, which is 1.
It checks if the remainder of 1 divided by k is less than 0, which is true.
It prints the final value of variable ans, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		int ans = n;
		int num = n % k;
		int num2 = 0;

		while(true) {
			num2 = Math.abs(num);
			ans = Math.min(ans, num2);
			if(num < 0) {
				break;
			}
			num = num -k;
		}
		
		System.out.println(ans);

	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
