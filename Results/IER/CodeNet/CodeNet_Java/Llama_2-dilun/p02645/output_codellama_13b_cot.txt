The variable s is initialized with the input string "takahashi".
Then it extracts the first 3 characters of the input string and print it as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        String s = sc.next();
        
        System.out.println(s.substring(0,3));
   }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```takahashi
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
