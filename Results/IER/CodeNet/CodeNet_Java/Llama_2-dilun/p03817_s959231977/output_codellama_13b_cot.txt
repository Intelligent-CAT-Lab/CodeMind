The code is a simple program that calculates the number of ways to represent a number as a sum of 5 and 6.
It first reads the number N from the input.
Then it calculates the number of ways to represent N as a sum of 5 and 6.
It does this by dividing N by 11 and then multiplying the result by 2.
It then calculates the remainder of N divided by 11 and subtracts 5 or 6 depending on whether the remainder is 0 or 1.
It then increments the count by 1 and repeats the process until N is 0.
Finally, it prints the final count.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.*;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) { //Simply store all segment starts and ends 
		//in array list and iterate through all possibilities accordingly
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		long N = input.nextLong();
		long cnt = N/11; //5+6 alternating while N>=11
		cnt*=2;
		N%=11;
		while (N>0) {
			if (cnt%2==0) N-=6;
			else N-=5;
			cnt++;
		}
		System.out.println(cnt);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
