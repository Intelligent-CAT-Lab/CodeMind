The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized with 2, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if variable a is greater than 0 and variable k is greater than 0. If it is, it checks if variable k is greater than variable a. If it is, it subtracts variable k from variable a and sets variable a to 0. If it is not, it subtracts variable a from variable k and sets variable k to 0.
It checks if variable b is greater than 0 and variable k is greater than 0. If it is, it checks if variable k is greater than variable b. If it is, it subtracts variable k from variable b and sets variable b to 0. If it is not, it subtracts variable b from variable k and sets variable k to 0.
It prints the final value of variable a and variable b as output, which is 0 3.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
