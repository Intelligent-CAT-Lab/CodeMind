The variable N, variable X and variable M are initialized with 6, 2 and 1001 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable now.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable now by multiplying the value of variable prev by itself and then modulo M.
If the value of variable now is 0, it breaks the loop and prints the sum of all the values in the array A.
If the value of variable now is not 0, it checks if the value of variable now is already in the set used.
If the value of variable now is already in the set used, it calculates the value of variable L by adding 1 to the value of variable i.
It also calculates the value of variable K by finding the index of variable now in the array A.
It also calculates the value of variable sub by summing up all the values in the array A from the index of variable K to the value of variable L.
It also calculates the value of variable m by finding the remainder of the value of variable N divided by the value of variable L.
It also calculates the value of variable left by summing up all the values in the array A from the index of variable K to the value of variable m.
It also calculates the value of variable ans by summing up the value of variable sub, the value of variable left and the value of variable ((N-K)/(L-K)).
If the value of variable now is not in the set used, it adds the value of variable now to the set used and adds the value of variable now to the array A.

After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable breakflag is true. If it is, it prints the value of variable ans.
If it is not, it prints the sum of all the values in the array A.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    static public void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int M = sc.nextInt();
        ArrayList<Integer> A = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0 ; i < N ; i++){
            A.add(sc.nextInt());
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < N ; i++){
            for(int j = i+1 ; j < N ; j++){
                if(A.get(i) == A.get(j)){
                    ans++;
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N and variable M are initialized with 10 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range.
It also enters a for loop and it iterates from i+1 to 9 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable A.get(i) is equal to the value of variable A.get(j).
If it is, it increments the value of variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable ans.
