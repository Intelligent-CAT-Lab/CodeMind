The variable N and variable M are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable s by multiplying the following terms:
(100 * (N - M) + 1900 * M) * (int) Math.pow(2, M)

The value of variable s is 1900.
<<<Output>>>
1900

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int m = sc.nextInt();
        int s = (100 * (n - m) + 1900 * m) * (int) Math.pow(2, m);
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
