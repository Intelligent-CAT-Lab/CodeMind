The variable H, A and B are initialized with 100, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 4 to check each integer i in this range.
It calculates the remainder of the variable H divided by variable i. If the remainder is 0, it adds 1 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * Design of a Mansion
 */
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int H, A, B;
		H = sc.nextInt();
		A = sc.nextInt();
		B = sc.nextInt();

		int ans = 0;

		for (int i = A; i <= B; i++) {
			if (H % i == 0) ans++;
		}

		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
