The variable A and variable B are initialized with 9 and 12 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable ans by comparing the value of variable A + variable B with 23. If the value is greater than 23, it subtracts 24 from the value of variable A + variable B. Otherwise, it just adds the value of variable A + variable B.
The value of variable ans is 25.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();

        int ans = A + B > 23? A + B - 24 : A + B;
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9 12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
