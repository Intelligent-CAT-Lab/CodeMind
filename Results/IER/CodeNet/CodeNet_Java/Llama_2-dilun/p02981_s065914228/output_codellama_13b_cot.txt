The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 2 and 9 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the minimum of A*N and B, which is 16.
It prints the value of 16 as output.
<<<Output>>>
16

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();

        int ans = Math.min(A*N, B);

        System.out.println(ans);

    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 9
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
