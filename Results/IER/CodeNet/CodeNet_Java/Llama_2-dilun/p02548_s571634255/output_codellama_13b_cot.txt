The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer A in this range.
The value of variable A is also passed to variable A.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable count by repeatedly dividing the value of variable N by variable A.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {



    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int N  = sc.nextInt();

        int count = 0;
        for (int A = 1; A<N  ; A++) {//A
            count+= (N-1)/A;
        }


        System.out.println(count);

    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
