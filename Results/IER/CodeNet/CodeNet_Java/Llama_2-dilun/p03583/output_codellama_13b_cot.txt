The variable n is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3510 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3510 to check each integer j in this range.
It calculates the value of variable si by multiplying the value of variable n with the product of variable i and variable j.
It calculates the value of variable bo by multiplying the value of variable 4 with the product of variable i and variable j and subtracting the value of variable n with the value of variable j and the value of variable n with the value of variable i.
It checks if the value of variable bo is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it continues the loop.
It checks if the value of variable si is divisible by the value of variable bo. If it is, it prints the value of variable i, variable j and the value of variable si divided by the value of variable bo.
It returns the value of variable i, variable j and the value of variable si divided by the value of variable bo.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long n = sc.nextLong();
        sc.close();
        // a
        for (int i = 1; i < 3510; i++) {
            // b
            for (int j = 1; j < 3510; j++) {
                long si = n * i * j;
                long bo = 4 * i * j - n * j - n * i;
                if (bo <= 0) {
                    continue;
                }
                if (si % bo == 0) {
                    System.out.println(i + " " + j + " " + (si / bo));
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
