The variable a, b and c are initialized with 3, 5 and 7 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 7 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the amount of b by multiplying it with i.
Then it calculates the time by multiplying a with i.
It checks if the time is less than or equal to c + 0.5. If it is, it adds the amount to variable amount.
The condition is met when i is 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable amount as output, which is 15.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int amount = 0;
      	int time = a;  
      
        for(int i = 2; time <= c + 0.5; i++){
            amount += b;
          	time = a * i;
        }
        
        System.out.println(amount);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
