The variable line is initialized with the input string "w32nimda".
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the input is empty.
Inside the while loop, it creates a new StringBuffer object and appends the input string to it.
Then it reverses the string in the StringBuffer object and prints it out.
The output is "adnima32w".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] argv) throws IOException{
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String line;
		while((line = br.readLine())!= null){
			StringBuffer reverse = new StringBuffer().append(line);
			System.out.print(reverse.reverse()+"\n");
		}
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```w32nimda
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
