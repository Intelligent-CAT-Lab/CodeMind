The variable A, B and C are initialized with 3, 8 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the condition (A < C && C < B)||(B < C && C < A) is met.
The condition is met when A is 3, B is 8 and C is 5.
So it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{

	public static void main(String[] args){

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        int C = sc.nextInt();
      
       if((A < C && C < B)||(B < C && C < A)){
         System.out.println("Yes");
       }else{
         System.out.println("No");
       }
	}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
