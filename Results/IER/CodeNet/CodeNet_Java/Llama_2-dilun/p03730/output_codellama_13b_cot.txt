The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 7, 5 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5000 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of variable a and variable i and then calculates the remainder of the product by dividing it by variable b.
If the remainder is equal to variable c, it prints "YES" and returns.
After the loop finishes, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
NO

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();

		for (int i = 0; i < 5000; i++) {
			if (a * i % b == c) {
				System.out.println("YES");
				return;
			}
		}
		System.out.println("NO");
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 5 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
