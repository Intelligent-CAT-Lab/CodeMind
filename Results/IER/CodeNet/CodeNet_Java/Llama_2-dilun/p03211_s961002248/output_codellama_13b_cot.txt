The input is a string of 8 characters.
The first 4 characters are converted to ints and stored in the array arr[0], arr[1], arr[2] and arr[3].
The next 4 characters are converted to ints and stored in the array arr[4], arr[5], arr[6] and arr[7].
The function abc is called with the first 3 elements of the array as parameters.
The function abc calculates the value of the sum of the first 3 elements of the array.
The value is then subtracted by 753.
If the value is greater than or equal to 0, it is returned.
If the value is less than 0, it is multiplied by -1 and returned.
The function returns 12.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.next(); 
		int[] arr = new int[s.length()];
		for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
			arr[i] = s.charAt(i) - '0';
		}
		int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
		for (int i = 0; i + 2 < s.length(); i++) {
			int value = abc(arr[i], arr[i + 1], arr[i + 2]);
			if (min >= value) {
				min = value;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(min);
		
	}
	
	public static int abc(int a, int b, int c) {
		int value = a * 100 + b * 10 + c;
		value -= 753;
		if (value >= 0) {
			return value;
		} else {
			return value * -1;
		}
	}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1234567876
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
