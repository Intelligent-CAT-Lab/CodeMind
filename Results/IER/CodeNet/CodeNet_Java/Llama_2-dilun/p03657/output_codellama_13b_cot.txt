The variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is divisible by 3, b is divisible by 3 or (a + b) is divisible by 3.
If any of the conditions is met, it prints "Possible". Otherwise, it prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Impossible

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        if( a % 3 == 0 || b % 3 == 0 || (a + b) % 3 == 0) System.out.println("Possible");
        else System.out.println("Impossible");
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
