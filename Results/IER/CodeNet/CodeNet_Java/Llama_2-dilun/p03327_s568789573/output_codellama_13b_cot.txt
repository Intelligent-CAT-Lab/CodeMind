The variable a is initialized with 999 according to the input.
It prints the string "ABD" as output.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
public static void main(String[] args){
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  int a = sc.nextInt();
  System.out.println(a >= 1000? "ABD":"ABC");
}}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
