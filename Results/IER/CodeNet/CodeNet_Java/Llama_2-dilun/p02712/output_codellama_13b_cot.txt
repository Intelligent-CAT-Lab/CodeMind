The variable S is initialized with 15.
It creates an array list with size S + 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 to check each integer i in this range.
If i is divisible by 3 or 5, it does nothing.
Otherwise, it adds i to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 105.
<<<Output>>>
105

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int S = sc.nextInt();
		int list[] = new int[S + 1];
		long ans = 0;
		for (int i = 1; i < S + 1; i++) {
			if (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0) {
			} else {
				ans = ans + i;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```15
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
