    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    final String S = sc.next();
    final String T = sc.next();
    sc.close();
    System.out.println(T+S);
  }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```oder atc
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
