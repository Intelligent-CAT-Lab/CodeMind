The variable n, variable x and variable a are initialized with 5, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable b is initialized with 3.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable a is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable c by calling the function refrect(a, b).
It checks if the value of variable c is 0. If it is, it breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 12.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	static long sum = 0;

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long n = sc.nextLong();
		long x = sc.nextLong();
		
		long a = Math.max(x, n-x);
		long b = Math.min(x, n-x);

		sum = a + b;
		while(true){
			long c = refrect(a, b);
			if(c==0) break;
			a = b;
			b = c;
		}

		System.out.println(sum);
	}

	static long refrect(long a, long b){
		long rest = a%b;
		long times = a/b;

		sum += b*times*2;
		if(rest==0) sum -= b;

		return rest;
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
