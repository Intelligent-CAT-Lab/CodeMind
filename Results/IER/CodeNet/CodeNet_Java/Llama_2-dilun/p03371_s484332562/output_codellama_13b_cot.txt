The variable a, b and c are initialized with 1500, 2000 and 1600 respectively according to the input.
The variable x and y are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively.
The variable price is initialized with 0.

It checks if the condition (a + b + 1) / 2 > c is true.
If it is true, it checks if x > y.
If x > y, it calculates the price as c * y * 2.
If a > c * 2, it adds c * (x - y) * 2 to the price.
Otherwise, it adds c * (x - y) * 2 to the price.

If x < y, it calculates the price as c * x * 2.
If b > c * 2, it adds c * (y - x) * 2 to the price.
Otherwise, it adds c * (y - x) * 2 to the price.

Otherwise, it calculates the price as a * x.
It adds a to the price for each iteration of the for loop.

It calculates the price as b * y.
It adds b to the price for each iteration of the for loop.

It prints the final value of variable price as output, which is 16000.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1500 2000 1600 3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
