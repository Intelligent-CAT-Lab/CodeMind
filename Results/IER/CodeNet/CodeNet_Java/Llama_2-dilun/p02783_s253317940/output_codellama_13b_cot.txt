The variable H and variable A are initialized with 10 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable a is initialized with 10/4, which is 2.5.
Then it calculates the value of variable b by adding 1 to variable a, which is 3.5.
Then it checks if the value of variable H is divisible by variable A. If it is, it prints the value of variable a. Otherwise, it prints the value of variable b.
The value of variable H is 10, which is not divisible by variable A. So it prints the value of variable b, which is 3.5.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int H =sc.nextInt();
      int A =sc.nextInt();
      
      int a =H/A;
      int b =a+1;
      
      if(H%A==0){
      System.out.println(a);
      }
      else if(H%A!=0){
      System.out.println(b);
      }   
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
