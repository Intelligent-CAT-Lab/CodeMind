The variable a is initialized with the input string "happy,newyear,enjoy".
It replaces all the commas with spaces and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);) {
            solve(sc);
        }
    }

    public static void solve(Scanner sc) {
        String a = sc.next();
        System.out.println(a.replaceAll(",", " "));
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```happy,newyear,enjoy
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
