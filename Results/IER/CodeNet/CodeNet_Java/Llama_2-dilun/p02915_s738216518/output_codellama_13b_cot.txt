The variable n is initialized with 2.
It checks if the value of n is between 1 and 9. If it is, it calculates the value of variable i as n*n*n.
It prints the value of variable i as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt();

    if(1<=n && n<=9){
      int i = n*n*n;
      System.out.println(i);
    }

  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
