The variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 10, 9, 10 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates while the condition (a>0) && (c>0) is true.
Inside the loop, it subtracts d from a and c from b.
After the loop finishes, it checks if c is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int c = sc.nextInt();
    int d = sc.nextInt();
    
    while((a>0) && (c>0)){
      a -= d;
      c -= b;
    }
    
    if(c>0){
      System.out.println("No");
    }
    else{
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 9 10 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
