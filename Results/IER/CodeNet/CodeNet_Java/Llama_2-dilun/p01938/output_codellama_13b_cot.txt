The variable list is initialized with the input string "AIZU".
The variable a is initialized with the first character of the input string, which is 'A'.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the input string is less than or equal to the current value of variable a.
If it does, it increments the value of variable sum.
Then it updates the value of variable a with the current character of the input string.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        char[] list=br.readLine().toCharArray();
        char a='A';
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<list.length;i++){
            if(list[i]<=a){
                sum++;
            }
            a=list[i];
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```AIZU
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
