The variable odd is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable odd.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger odd by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable odd.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable odd as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int odd = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
			odd += sc.nextInt() % 2;
		}
		System.out.println(odd >= 2? "Hom" : "Tem");
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
