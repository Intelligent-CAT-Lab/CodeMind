The variable beforeC is initialized with true.
It iterates through the input string and checks if the first character is C. If it is, it sets the variable beforeC to false.
It iterates through the input string again and checks if the last character is F. If it is, it prints "Yes" and returns.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		char[] arr = sc.next().toCharArray();
		boolean beforeC = true;
		for (char c : arr) {
			if (beforeC) {
				if (c == 'C') {
					beforeC = false;
				}
			} else {
				if (c == 'F') {
					System.out.println("Yes");
					return;
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println("No");
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```CODEFESTIVAL
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
