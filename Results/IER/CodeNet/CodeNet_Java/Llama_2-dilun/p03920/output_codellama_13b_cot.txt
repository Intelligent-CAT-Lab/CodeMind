The variable N is initialized with 4.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until N is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the sum of the integers from 1 to i by using a for loop.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is greater than or equal to N. If it does, it prints the value of variable i and subtracts i from N.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable N as output, which is 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int N = sc.nextInt();
    while (N > 0) {
      int sum = 0;
      for (int i = 1; ; i++) {
        sum += i;
        if (sum >= N) {
          System.out.println(i);
          N -= i;
          break;
        }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
