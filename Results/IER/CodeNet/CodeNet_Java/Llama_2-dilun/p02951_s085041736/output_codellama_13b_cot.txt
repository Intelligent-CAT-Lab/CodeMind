The variable A, B and C are initialized with 6, 4 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the difference between A and B, which is 2.
It calculates the difference between C and 2, which is 1.
It prints the absolute value of the difference between A and B and C, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int A = sc.nextInt();
		int B = sc.nextInt();
		int C = sc.nextInt();

		int ans = C - (A - B);
		System.out.println(ans > 0? ans : 0);

	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 4 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
