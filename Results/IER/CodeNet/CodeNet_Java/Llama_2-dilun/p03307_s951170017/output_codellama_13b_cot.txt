The variable n is initialized with 3.
It checks if the value of n is even or odd. If it is odd, it multiplies the value of n by 2.
Then it prints the value of n.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long n = sc.nextLong();
        if (n % 2!= 0) n *= 2;
        System.out.println(n);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
