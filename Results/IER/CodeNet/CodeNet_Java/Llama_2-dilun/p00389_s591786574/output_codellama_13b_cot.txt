The variable n and variable k are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates while n is greater than or equal to row.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable w by adding the value of variable row to variable w.
Then it checks if the value of variable row*k is greater than or equal to variable w. If it is, it increments the value of variable res and variable w by variable row.
Then it checks if the value of variable n is greater than or equal to variable row+1. If it is, it increments the value of variable row.
Otherwise, it breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable res as output, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

class Main {

    void solve(){

	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	int n = sc.nextInt(), k = sc.nextInt();

	int res = 0;
	int row = 1;

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
