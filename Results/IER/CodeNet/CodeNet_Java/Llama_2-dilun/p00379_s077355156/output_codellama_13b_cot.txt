The variable a, n and m are initialized with 16, 2 and 1000 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 16 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num2.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable y by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable y.
Then it calculates the value of variable x by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable x.
It checks if the value of variable x is equal to the value of variable num2. If it is, it adds 1 to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192 and 16384.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 16.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int ans = 0;

		int a = scan.nextInt();
		int n = scan.nextInt();
		int m = scan.nextInt();

		
		for(long i = a + a == 0? 1 : 0; Math.pow(i, n) <= m && Math.pow(i, n) >= 0;i++) {

			long num2 = (long)Math.pow(i, n);
			
			
			long y = Dudeney(num2);
			long x = (int) Math.pow(y + a,n);
			
			if(num2 == x) {
				ans++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans);

		scan.close();
	}

	public static long Dudeney(long num) {
		int Ans = 0;

		while(num!= 0) {
			Ans += num%10;
			num /= 10;

		return Ans;
	}
}


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```16 2 1000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
