The variable W is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 6 respectively.
It checks if a+W<b. If it is true, it prints the value of b-a-W.
It checks if b+W<a. If it is true, it prints the value of a-b-W.
It checks if a+W<b and b+W<a are false. It prints 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int W = sc.nextInt();
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		if(a+W<b) {
			System.out.println(b-a-W);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
