The variable A, B and C are initialized with 2, 11 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable B/A is greater than or equal to the value of variable C.
If it is, it prints the value of variable C.
Otherwise, it prints the value of variable B/A.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String arg[]) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int A = sc.nextInt();
		int B = sc.nextInt();
		int C = sc.nextInt();
		
		if(B/A >= C) {
			System.out.print(C);
		} else if(B/A < C) {
			System.out.print(B/A);
		}

	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 11 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
