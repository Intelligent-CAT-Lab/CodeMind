The variable n is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from max to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable max.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the square root of variable n and stores it in variable max.
Then it checks if the current value of variable i is a factor of variable n. If it does, it calculates the quotient of variable n and variable i and stores it in variable x.
Then it prints the value of variable i - 1 and variable x - 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable i - 1 and variable x - 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long n = sc.nextLong();
        long max = (long) Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(n));
        for (long i = max; i >= 1; i--) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                long x = n / i;
                System.out.println((i - 1) + (x - 1));
                return;

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
