The variable s is initialized with the input string "101".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the input string is '1'. If it is, it increments the variable counter.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable counter as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.next();

		int counter = 0;
		for (int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
			if ( s.charAt(i) == '1') counter++;
		}
		System.out.println(counter);
	}

}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```101
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
