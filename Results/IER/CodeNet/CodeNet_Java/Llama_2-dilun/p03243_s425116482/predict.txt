The variable n is initialized with 111.
It calculates the sum of the digits of the variable n by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable san.
It checks if the calculated variable san is less than or equal to the variable ok. If it is, it prints the variable ok as output.
Otherwise, it increments the variable san by 1 and calculates the sum of the digits of the variable n again.
It checks if the calculated variable san is less than or equal to the variable ok. If it is, it prints the variable ok as output.
Otherwise, it increments the variable san by 1 and calculates the sum of the digits of the variable n again.
