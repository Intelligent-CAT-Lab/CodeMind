The variable r is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It prints the value of 3*r*r, which is 48.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
	
    public static void main(String[] args){

	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	int r = sc.nextInt();

	System.out.println(3*r*r);

  }
 }
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
