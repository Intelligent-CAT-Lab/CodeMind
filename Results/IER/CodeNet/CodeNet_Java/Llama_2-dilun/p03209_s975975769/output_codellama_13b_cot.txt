The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable x is initialized with 7.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable layer[i].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of layer[i] by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable layer[i].
The value of layer[0] is initialized with 1 and the value of layer[1] is initialized with 3.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
