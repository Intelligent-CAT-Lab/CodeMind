The variable p, variable m and variable c are initialized with 10, 10 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It prints the sum of the three variables p, m and c, which is 40.
<<<Output>>>
40

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		int p = s.nextInt();
		int m = s.nextInt();
		int c = s.nextInt();
		
		System.out.println(p+m+c);
		
		
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 10 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
