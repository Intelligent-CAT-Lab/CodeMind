The variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 12 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the remainder of variable b divided by variable a, which is 0.
Then it prints the sum of variable a and variable b, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int b = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());

        System.out.println((b % a == 0)? a + b : b - a);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
