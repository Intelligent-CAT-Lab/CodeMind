The variable N, variable A, variable B, variable C and variable D are initialized with 5, 1, 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable max and variable min.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum and minimum value of the difference between variable B and variable A.
The maximum value is calculated as D*(N-1-i)-C*i, and the minimum value is calculated as C*(N-1-i)-D*i.
Then it checks if the calculated variable max is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to the minimum value. If it does, it prints "YES" as output.
The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.
After the loop finishes, it prints "NO" as output.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Main().solve();
	}
	
	void solve(){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int N=sc.nextInt();
		long A=sc.nextLong();
		long B=sc.nextLong();
		long C=sc.nextLong();
		long D=sc.nextLong();
		
		for(int i=0;i<=N-1;i++){
			long max=D*(N-1-i)-C*i;
			long min=C*(N-1-i)-D*i;
			if(Math.abs(B-A)>=min && Math.abs(B-A)<=max){
				System.out.println("YES");
				return;
			}
		}
		System.out.println("NO");
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
