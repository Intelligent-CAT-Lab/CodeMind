The variable a and variable b are initialized with 5 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is less than or equal to b. If it is, it prints a. Otherwise, it prints a-1.
<<<Output>>>
5

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        
        if(a <= b){
            System.out.println(a);
        }else{
            System.out.println(a-1);
        }
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
