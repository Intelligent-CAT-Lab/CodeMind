The variable s is initialized with the input string.
The variable words is initialized with the character array of the input string.
The variable min is initialized with 0.
The variable max is initialized with 0.

It enters a for loop and it iterates from the length of the input string to 0.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at the current index of the input string is 'A'. If it is, it sets the variable min to the current index.

It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at the current index of the input string is 'Z'. If it is, it sets the variable max to the current index.

It prints the value of variable max - variable min + 1 as output, which is 26.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		String s = stdIn.next();
		char[] words = s.toCharArray();
		int min = 0;
		int max = 0;
		for(int i = s.length()-1; i >= 0; i--) {

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```QWERTYASDFZXCV
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
