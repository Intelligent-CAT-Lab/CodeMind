The variable n and variable m are initialized with 1 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if n * 2 <= m. If it is true, it sets c to n and subtracts n * 2 from m.
Otherwise, it sets c to m / 2 and sets m to 0.
It adds c to m / 4.
It prints the final value of c as output, which is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
		int m = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
		int c = 0;
		if (n * 2 <= m) {
			c = n;
			m -= n * 2;
		}
		else {
			c = m / 2;
			m = 0;
		}
		c += m / 4;
		System.out.println(c);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
