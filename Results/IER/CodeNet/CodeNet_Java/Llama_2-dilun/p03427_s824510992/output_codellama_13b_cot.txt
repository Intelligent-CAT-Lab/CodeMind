The variable n is initialized with the input string "100".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each character in the string.
It checks if the current character is not equal to '9'. If it is, it breaks the loop.
It calculates the sum of the digits of the string by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable ans.
It prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		char[] n = sc.next().toCharArray();
		boolean flag = false;
		for(int i = 1; i < n.length; i++) {
			if(n[i]!= '9') {
				flag = true;
				break;
			}
		}
		int ans = (n[0]-'0')+9*(n.length-1);
		if(flag) {
			 ans = (n[0]-'1')+9*(n.length-1);
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
