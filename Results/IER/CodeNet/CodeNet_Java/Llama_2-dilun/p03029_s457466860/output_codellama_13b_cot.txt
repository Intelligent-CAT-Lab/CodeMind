The variable a and variable p are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
Then it calculates the value of variable p by multiplying variable a with 3 and adding variable p to it.
Then it prints the value of variable p divided by 2.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int p = sc.nextInt();

		sc.close();

		p = a * 3 + p;

		System.out.print(p / 2);

	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
