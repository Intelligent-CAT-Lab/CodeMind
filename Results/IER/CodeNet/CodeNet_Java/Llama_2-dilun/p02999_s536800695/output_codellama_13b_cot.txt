The variable x is initialized with 3 and variable a is initialized with 5.
It checks if x is less than a. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 10.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

      int x=sc.nextInt();
      int a=sc.nextInt();

      if(x<a){
          System.out.println("0");
      }
      else{
        System.out.println("10");
      }

    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
