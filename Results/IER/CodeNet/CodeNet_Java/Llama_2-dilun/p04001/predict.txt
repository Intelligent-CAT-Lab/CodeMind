The input is 125.

The code first converts the input to a string and stores it in variable S.

Then it initializes an array N with the length of S.

It then calculates the pattern count as 1.

It then initializes a string tmpBit with an empty string.

It then iterates through the array N and calculates the value of each element.

It then calculates the value of variable patternCount as 2.

It then calculates the value of variable tmpBit as "1".

It then iterates through the array N and calculates the value of each element.

It then calculates the value of variable sum as 0.

It then iterates through the array N and calculates the value of each element.

It then calculates the value of variable sum as 125.
