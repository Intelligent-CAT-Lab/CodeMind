The variable x1, y1, x2 and y2 are initialized with 0, 0, 0 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable x3, y3, x4 and y4 are initialized with 0, 0, 0 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable diffX and variable diffY are initialized with 0 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable x3 is initialized with x2 - diffY, which is 0 - 1, which is -1.
The variable y3 is initialized with y2 + diffX, which is 0 + 0, which is 0.
The variable x4 is initialized with x3 - diffX, which is -1 - 0, which is -1.
The variable y4 is initialized with y3 - diffY, which is 0 - 1, which is -1.
The output is -1 -1 -1 -1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x1 = sc.nextInt();
		int y1 = sc.nextInt();
		int x2 = sc.nextInt();
		int y2 = sc.nextInt();

		int x3;
		int y3;
		int x4;
		int y4;

		int diffX = x2-x1;
		int diffY = y2-y1;
		x3 = x2 - diffY;
		y3 = y2 + diffX;
		x4 = x3 - diffX;
		y4 = y3 - diffY;
		System.out.println(x3 + " " + y3 + " " + x4 + " " + y4);
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0 0 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
