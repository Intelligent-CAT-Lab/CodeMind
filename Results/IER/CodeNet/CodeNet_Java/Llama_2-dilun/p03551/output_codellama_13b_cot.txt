The variable n and variable m are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the base value of the number by multiplying n and 100 and adding m and 1800.
It prints the result of the calculation.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Main m = new Main();
		m.run();
	}

	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	void run() {

		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();
		
		
		long base = n*100+m*1800;
		
		System.out.println(base << m);
		
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
