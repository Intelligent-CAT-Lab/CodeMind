The variable s is initialized with the input string "sardine".
The variable l is initialized with the length of the input string.
The variable ans is initialized with an empty string.

It iterates from 0 to l to process each character in the input string.
For each character, it appends "x" to the variable ans.

After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is "xxxxx".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.nextLine();
		int l = s.length();
		String ans = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < l; i++) {
        	ans += "x";
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
		}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```sardine
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
