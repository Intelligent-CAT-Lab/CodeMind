The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 8, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the sum of variable a and variable b, which is 7.
It calculates the remainder of variable n divided by 7, which is 1.
It calculates the quotient of variable n divided by 7, which is 1.
It calculates the product of variable a and variable div, which is 3.
It calculates the minimum of variable mod and variable a, which is 3.
It prints the final value of variable div * a + variable min, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long n = sc.nextLong();
        long a = sc.nextLong();
        long b = sc.nextLong();
        long sum = a + b;
        long mod = n % sum;
        long div = n / sum;
        System.out.println(div * a + Math.min(mod, a));
    }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
