The variable X is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by repeatedly multiplying ans by 2 and adding 2 to ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
                try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
                        int X = sc.nextInt();
                        long ans = 2;
                        for (int i = X; i > 0; i--) {
                                ans = ans * 2 + 2;
                        }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
