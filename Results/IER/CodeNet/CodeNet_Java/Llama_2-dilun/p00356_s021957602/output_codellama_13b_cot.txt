The variable x and y are initialized with 4 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until x1 is equal to y1.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the difference between x1 and y1.
If x1 is smaller than y1, it subtracts x1 from y1.
Otherwise, it subtracts y1 from x1.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of x1 as output, which is 0.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
