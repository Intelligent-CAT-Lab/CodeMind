The variable acnt is initialized with 0.
It iterates through the input string s and checks if the current character c is 'A'. If it is, it increments the value of variable acnt.
It checks if the current character c is 'B' and the next character is 'C'. If it is, it increments the value of variable acnt and increments the index i by 1.
It checks if the current character c is not 'A' or 'B' and 'C'. If it is, it resets the value of variable acnt to 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        int acnt = 0;
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (c == 'A') {
                acnt++;

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ABCABC
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
