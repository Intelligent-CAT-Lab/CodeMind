The variable s is initialized with the input string "internationalization".
The variable word is initialized with a character array of length s.length()-2.
The variable len is initialized with s.length()-2.
The for loop iterates from 0 to s.length()-1.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character at index i of the input string s and stores it in the character array word at index i.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of word[0] + len + word[s.length()-1] as output, which is "internationalizat".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main (String [] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s =sc.next();
        char [] word = new char[s.length()];
        int len = s.length()-2;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
            word[i] = s.charAt(i);
        }
        System.out.println(String.valueOf(word[0])+len+String.valueOf(word[s.length()-1]));
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```internationalization
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
