The variable a and variable b are initialized with 54 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until variable b is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the remainder of variable a divided by variable b and assigns it to variable ans.
Then it assigns variable b to variable a and variable a to variable b.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable a as output, which is 54.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void calcu(int a,int b){
		int ans=a;
		while(b!=0){
			ans = a % b; 
			a = b; 
			b = ans; 
		}
		System.out.println(a);
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = scan.nextInt();
		int b = scan.nextInt();
		if(a>b)
			calcu(a,b);
		else
			calcu(b,a);
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```54 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
