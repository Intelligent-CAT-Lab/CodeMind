The input is 2 2 4.
The first line of code calculates the capacity of the bottle as a*a*b.
The second line of code calculates the capacity of the bottle as a*a*a*tan8/2.
The third line of code calculates the capacity of the bottle as 2*(bottleCapacity-x)/(a*a*a).
The fourth line of code calculates the capacity of the bottle as Math.atan(2*(bottleCapacity-x)/(a*a*a)).
The fifth line of code calculates the capacity of the bottle as Math.toDegrees(Math.atan(2*(bottleCapacity-x)/(a*a*a))).
The sixth line of code prints the capacity of the bottle as 108.
<<<Output>>>
108

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        double a = sc.nextDouble();
        double b = sc.nextDouble();
        double x = sc.nextDouble();

        double bottleCapacity = a*a*b;

        if(x*2 < bottleCapacity){
            //solve a*b*b/2tan8 == x
            System.out.println(Math.toDegrees(Math.atan(a*b*b/(2*x))));
        }else{
            //solve a*a*a*tan8/2 = cap-x
            System.out.println(Math.toDegrees(Math.atan(2*(bottleCapacity-x)/(a*a*a))));
        }

    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
