The variable a, b and c are initialized with 1500, 2000 and 1600 respectively according to the input.
The variable x and y are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively.
The variable nc is initialized with c*2, which is 3200.
The variable price is initialized with Long.MAX_VALUE, which is 2^64-1.
The variable tmpPrice is initialized with 0.

It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100000 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of tmpPrice by multiplying the value of nc with i and adding the value of a with the maximum value of x-i and the value of b with the maximum value of y-i.
If the value of tmpPrice is greater than the value of price, it updates the value of price with tmpPrice.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of price as output, which is 16000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
