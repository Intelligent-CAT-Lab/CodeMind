The variable s is initialized with the input string "29".
Then it checks if the first character of the string is '9' or the second character of the string is '9'.
If it is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    void solve(){
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scan.next();
        System.out.println(s.charAt(0) == '9' || s.charAt(1) == '9'? "Yes" : "No");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        new Main().solve();
    }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```29
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
