The variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer m in this range. The value of variable m is also passed to variable m.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger m by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it prints the final value of variable sum as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		
		int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
		
		for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
			for(int j=0; j<n; j++) {
				dp[i][j] = 0;
			}
		}
		
		for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
			for(int j=0; j<n; j++) {
				dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] + dp[i][j-1];
			}
		}
		
		for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
			for(int j=0; j<n; j++) {
				System.out.print(dp[i][j] + " ");
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
