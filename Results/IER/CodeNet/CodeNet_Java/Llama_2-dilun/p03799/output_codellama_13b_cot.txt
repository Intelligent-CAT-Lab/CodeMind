The variable N and variable M are initialized with 1 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if N is greater than M. If it is, it prints the value of M/2 as output and exits the program.
It checks if N is 1 and M is 1. If it is, it prints 0 as output and exits the program.
It checks if N is 2 and M is 1. If it is, it prints 0 as output and exits the program.
It checks if N * 2 is greater than M. If it is, it prints the value of M/2 as output and exits the program.
It calculates the value of variable ans by adding N and the value of M - N * 2 divided by 4.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
