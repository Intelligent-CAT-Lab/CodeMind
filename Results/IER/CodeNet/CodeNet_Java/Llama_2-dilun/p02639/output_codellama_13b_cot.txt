The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the integer value of variable x and adds it to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int[] x = new int[5];
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
            x[i] = sc.nextInt();
            sum += x[i];
        }
        System.out.println(15-sum);
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 2 3 4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
