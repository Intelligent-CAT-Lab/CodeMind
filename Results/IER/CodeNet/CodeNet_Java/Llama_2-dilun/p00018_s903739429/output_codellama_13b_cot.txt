The input is 3 6 9 7 5.
The first element is 3, so the first element is inserted into the array at index 0.
The second element is 6, so the second element is inserted into the array at index 1.
The third element is 9, so the third element is inserted into the array at index 2.
The fourth element is 7, so the fourth element is inserted into the array at index 3.
The fifth element is 5, so the fifth element is inserted into the array at index 4.
The quick sort algorithm is applied to the array.
The output is 3 6 9 7 5.

class Main{

	public static void quickSort(int[] arr, int left, int right){

		while(l <= r) {
			while(arr[l] < p){ l++; }
			while(arr[r] > p){ r--; }

			if (l <= r) {
				int tmp = arr[l];
				arr[l] = arr[r];
				arr[r] = tmp;
				l++; 
				r--;
			}
		}
		quickSort(arr, left, r);
		quickSort(arr, l, right);
		}
	}
