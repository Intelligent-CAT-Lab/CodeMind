The variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized with 3, 8 and 2 respectively according to the input.

It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable A.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger A by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 8]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable nums. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,6,7.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable nums as output, which is 2,3,4,5,6,7.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = scan.nextInt();
		int M = scan.nextInt();
		int K = scan.nextInt();
		int[][] arr = new int[N][M];

		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
				arr[i][j] = scan.nextInt();
			}
		}

		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
				if (arr[i][j] == 1) {
					arr[i][j] = 0;
					arr[i][j - 1] = 1;
					arr[i][j + 1] = 1;
				}
			}
		}

		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
				System.out.print(arr[i][j] + " ");
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
	}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
