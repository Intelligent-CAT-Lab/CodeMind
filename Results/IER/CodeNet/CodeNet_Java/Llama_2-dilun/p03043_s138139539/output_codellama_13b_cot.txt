The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable p by repeatedly dividing 1 by 2 until the value of variable tmp is greater than or equal to 10.
Then it calculates the value of variable ans by adding the value of variable p to the value of variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 0.16666666666666666.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();

        double ans = 0.0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

            double p = 1;
            int tmp = i;

            while (tmp < k) {
                p *= 0.5;
                tmp *= 2;
            }
            ans += p / n;
        }

        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
