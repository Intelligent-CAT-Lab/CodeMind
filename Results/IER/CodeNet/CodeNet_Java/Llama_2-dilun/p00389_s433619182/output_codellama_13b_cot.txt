The variable count is initialized with 4 and variable strength is initialized with 2.
The variable total is initialized with 1 and variable size is initialized with 1.
The variable count is decremented by 1.
The variable total is calculated as the sum of variable total and variable strength minus 1.
The variable x is calculated as the quotient of variable total and variable strength.
The variable count is compared with variable x.
If the variable count is greater than or equal to variable x, the variable size is incremented by 1.
The variable total is updated with the variable x.
The variable count is decremented by variable x.
The loop continues until the variable count is less than variable x.
The variable size is printed as the output.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int count = sc.nextInt();
		int strength = sc.nextInt();
		int total = 1;
		int size = 1;
		count--;
		while (true) {
		    int x = (total + strength - 1) / strength;
		    if (count >= x) {
		        size++;
		        total += x;
		        count -= x;
		    } else {
		        break;
		    }

		System.out.println(size);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
