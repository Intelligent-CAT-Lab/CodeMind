The variable s is initialized with the input.
It checks if the first character of the input is "Y". If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] a = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            a[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += a[i];
        }
        System.out.println(sum);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1 2 3```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It initializes an array a with 3 elements.
It iterates from 0 to 2 to fill the array a with the input values.
It calculates the sum of the elements of array a by iterating from 0 to 2 and adding the elements of array a.
It prints the final value of variable sum as output, which is 6.
