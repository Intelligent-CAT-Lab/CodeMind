The variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable count.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
		int count = 0;
		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
