The variable n is initialized with 6.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cnt.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable cnt by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable cnt.
Then it checks if the calculated variable cnt is greater than 0. If it is, it multiplies the value of variable ans by the value of variable i raised to the power of variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt(),ans=1,cnt;
        for(int i=2;i<=n;i++){
            cnt=0;
            while(n%i==0){
                cnt++;
                n/=i;
            }
            if(cnt>0) ans*=(int)(Math.pow(i,cnt)-Math.pow(i,cnt-1));
        }
        System.out.println(ans);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
