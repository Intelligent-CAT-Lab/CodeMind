The variable a is initialized with 1, 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It sorts the array a in ascending order.
It prints the product of a[2] * 10 + a[1] + a[0], which is 152.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int[] a = new int[3];

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            a[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        Arrays.sort(a);

        System.out.println(a[2] * 10 + a[1] + a[0]);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 5 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
