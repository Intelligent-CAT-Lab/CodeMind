The variable w and variable h are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable w is 1 or variable h is 1. If it is, it prints 1 as output and returns.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable c by calculating the product of variable w and variable h and then dividing it by 2. If the remainder of the division is 0, it prints 1 as output. Otherwise, it prints the value of variable c as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = scan.nextInt();
		int m = scan.nextInt();

		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = scan.nextInt();
		}

		int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
		for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
			for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
				if(i == 0) {
					dp[i][j] = arr[j];
				} else {
					dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1]) + arr[j];

		System.out.println(dp[m-1][n-1]);
	}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It creates an array of size n to store the input values.
It creates a 2D array of size m x n to store the result.
It initializes the first row of the 2D array with the first input value.
It iterates from 1 to m to calculate the value of the second row.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current iteration is the first iteration. If it is, it initializes the second row with the first input value. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum value of the previous row and the previous column and adds the current input value to it.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of the last row and the last column of the 2D array as output.
