The variable sc is initialized with a Scanner object.
It prints the output of the code.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main{
public static void main(String[]args){
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
  System.out.println(sc.nextInt()<=sc.nextInt()?"unsafe":"safe");
}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
