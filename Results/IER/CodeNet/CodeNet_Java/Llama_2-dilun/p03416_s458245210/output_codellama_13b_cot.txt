The variable a and variable b are initialized with 11009 and 11332 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 11009 to 11332 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable _i.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the first and fourth character of variable _i are the same and the first and third character of variable _i are the same. If it does, it adds 1 to variable count. The condition is met when i is 11009, 11111, 11222, 11332.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 4.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) {
      String _i = new String().valueOf(i);
      if (_i.charAt(0) == _i.charAt(4) && _i.charAt(1) == _i.charAt(3)) {
        count++;
      }
    }
    System.out.println(count);
  }

}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11009 11332
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
