The variable A and variable B are initialized with 12 and 18 respectively according to the input.
The variable g is initialized with the gcd of A and B.
The variable count is initialized with 1.

It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 18 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable g.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the variable g is divisible by variable i. If it is, it increments the variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
    static long gcd(long a, long b){
        return b == 0? a : gcd(b,a % b); 
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long A = sc.nextLong();
        long B = sc.nextLong();

        long g = gcd(A, B);
        int count = 1;
        for(long i = 2; i*i <= g; i++){
            if(g % i == 0){
                count++;
                while(g % i == 0){
                    g /= i;
                }
            } 
        }
        if(g > 1) count++;

        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12 18
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
