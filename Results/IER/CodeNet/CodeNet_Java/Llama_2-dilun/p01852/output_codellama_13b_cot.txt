The variable n is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates while n is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of n by dividing it by 2.
It increments the value of count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * A :???????????°?????? / Finger Counting
 */
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String line;

		long n = sc.nextLong();
		int count = 0;

		if (n > 0) {
			while (n >= 2) {
				n /= 2;
				count++;
			}
			count++;
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
