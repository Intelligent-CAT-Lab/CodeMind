The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the condition a <= c && c <= b is met.
If it is met, it prints "Yes" as output.
If it is not met, it prints "No" as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        
        String result = "No";
        if (a <= c && c <= b) result ="Yes";
        
        System.out.println(result);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
