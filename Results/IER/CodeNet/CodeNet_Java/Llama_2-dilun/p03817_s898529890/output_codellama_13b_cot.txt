The variable x is initialized with 7.
The variable rest is initialized with 7%11, which is 4.
The variable result is initialized with (7-4)/11, which is 2.
The variable result is multiplied by 2, which is 4.
The variable result is incremented by 1 if the variable rest is greater than 0, which is 5.
The variable result is incremented by 1 if the variable rest is greater than 6, which is 6.
The variable result is printed as output, which is 6.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		long x = scan.nextLong();
		long rest = x%11L;
		long result = (x-rest)/11L;
		result*=2L;
		if(rest>0) result++;
		if(rest>6) result++;
		System.out.println(result);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
