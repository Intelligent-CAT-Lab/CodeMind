The variable day is initialized with 25.
It enters a switch statement and it checks the value of variable day with the cases 25, 24, 23 and 22.
If the value of variable day is 25, it prints "Christmas".
If the value of variable day is 24, it prints "Christmas Eve".
If the value of variable day is 23, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve".
If the value of variable day is 22, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve Eve".
<<<Output>>>
Christmas

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    int day = scan.nextInt();
    switch(day){
      case 25:
        System.out.println("Christmas");
        break;
      case 24:
        System.out.println("Christmas Eve");
        break;
      case 23:
        System.out.println("Christmas Eve Eve");
        break;
      case 22:
        System.out.println("Christmas Eve Eve Eve");
        break;
    }
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```25
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
