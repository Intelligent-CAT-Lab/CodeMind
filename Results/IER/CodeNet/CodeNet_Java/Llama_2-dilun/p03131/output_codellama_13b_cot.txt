The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 2 and 6 respectively according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with 1+K, which is 5.
The variable sum1 is initialized with 1.
The variable A is compared with variable sum1. Since A is greater than sum1, the variable sum1 is set to A.
The variable sum1 is initialized with A, which is 2.
The variable sum1 is initialized with B-A, which is 4.
The variable sum1 is initialized with (B-A)*(K/2), which is 8.
The variable sum1 is initialized with Math.max(sum, sum1), which is 5.
The variable sum is initialized with sum1, which is 5.
The variable sum is printed as output, which is 5.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        long K = sc.nextLong();
        long A = sc.nextLong();
        long B = sc.nextLong();
        sc.close();

        long sum = 1+K;
        if(A < B){
            long sum1 = 1;
            if(A > sum1){
                K -= (A-sum1);
                sum1 = A;
            }
            sum1 += (B-A)*(K/2);
            if(K%2 == 1)
                sum1 += 1;
            sum = Math.max(sum, sum1);
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
   }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
