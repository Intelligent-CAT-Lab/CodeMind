The variable r is initialized with the square root of the input.
Then it multiplies the value of variable r with itself to get the output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {
			execute(scanner);
		}
	}

	private static void execute(Scanner scanner) {
		int r = (int) Math.sqrt(scanner.nextInt());
		System.out.println(r * r);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
