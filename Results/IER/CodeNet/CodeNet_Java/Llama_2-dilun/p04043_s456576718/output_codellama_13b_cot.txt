The input is 5 5 7.
The first element of the array is 5, the second element is 5 and the third element is 7.
The array is sorted in ascending order.
The output is YES.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    static Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
    public static void main(String __[]) {
        int in[]= {s.nextInt(),s.nextInt(),s.nextInt()};
        Arrays.sort(in);
        System.out.println(in[0]==5&&in[1]==5&&in[2]==7?"YES":"NO");

    }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 5 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
