    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        char[] s = sc.next().toCharArray();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```B
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
