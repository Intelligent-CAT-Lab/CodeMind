The variable c is initialized with the first character of the input.
The variable next is initialized with the value of variable c + 1.
The variable next is converted to a character with the method Character.toChars().
The character is printed with the method System.out.println().

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		char c = sc.next().charAt(0);
		sc.close();
		int next = c + 1;
		System.out.println(Character.toChars(next));

	}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```a
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
