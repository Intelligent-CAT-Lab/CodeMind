The variable a is initialized with 68.
The variable sum is initialized with (a - 30) / 2.
The value of variable sum is 19.
The value of variable sum is printed as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a,b,c,sum;
		a = scan.nextInt();
		
		sum = (a - 30) / 2;
		
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```68
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
