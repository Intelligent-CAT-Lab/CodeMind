The variable S is initialized with the input string. The variable length is initialized with the length of the input string.
The variable c is initialized with the first character of the input string and the variable d is initialized with the last character of the input string.
The variable cnt is initialized with 0.

It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to length/2 to check each character pair in this range.
Inside the for loop, it compares the value of variable c with the value of variable d. If they are different, it increments the value of variable cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable cnt as output, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
//Atcoder ABC147 C

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		String S = sc.next();
		int length = S.length();
		char c =' ';
		char d =' ';
		int cnt = 0;

		for(int i=0;i<length/2;i++) {
			c = S.charAt(i);
			d = S.charAt(length-i-1);
			if(c!=d) {
				cnt++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(cnt);
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```redcoder
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
