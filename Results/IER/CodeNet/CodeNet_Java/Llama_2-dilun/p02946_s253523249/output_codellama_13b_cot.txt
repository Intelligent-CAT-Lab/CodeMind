The variable k is initialized with 3 and variable x is initialized with 7.
It calculates the minimum value of variable x - k + 1 and the maximum value of variable x + k - 1.
It prints the values of variable i from variable min to variable max.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    int k = sc.nextInt();
    int x = sc.nextInt();
    
    int min = x - k + 1;
    int max = x + k - 1;

    for (int i = min; i <= max; i++) {
      System.out.print(i + (i == max? "": " "));
    }
    System.out.println();
    
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
