The input is "needed".
The first if statement checks if the input is a single character. If it is, it prints "-1 -1" and returns.
The second if statement checks if the input is a two character string. If it is, it checks if the two characters are the same. If they are, it prints "1 2" and returns. If they are not, it prints "-1 -1" and returns.
The third for loop iterates from 1 to the length of the input minus 1. It checks if the current character is the same as the previous character or the next character. If it is, it prints the current index and the next index and returns.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "-1 -1" and returns.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		char s[] = scanner.next().toCharArray();
		if (s.length == 1) {

			System.out.println("-1 -1");
			return;
		}
		if(s.length == 2){
			if(s[0]==s[1]){
				System.out.println("1 2");
				return;
			}else{
				System.out.println("-1 -1");
				return;
			}
		}
		for (int i = 1; i < s.length - 1; i++) {
			if (s[i - 1] == s[i] || s[i + 1] == s[i] || s[i - 1] == s[i + 1]) {
				System.out.println(i + " " + (i + 2));
				return;
			}
		}
		System.out.println("-1 -1");
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```needed
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
