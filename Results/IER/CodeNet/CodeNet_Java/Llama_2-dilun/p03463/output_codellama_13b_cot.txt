<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the difference between variable a and variable b, which is 2.
It checks if the difference is odd or even. If it is odd, it prints "Borys". If it is even, it prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Borys

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = in.nextInt();
		int a = in.nextInt();
		int b = in.nextInt();
		
		int k = b - a;
		if(k % 2 == 1) System.out.println("Borys");
		else System.out.println("Alice");
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
