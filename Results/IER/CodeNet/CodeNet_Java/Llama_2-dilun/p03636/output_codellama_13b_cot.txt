The variable s is initialized with the input string "internationalization".
The variable leng is initialized with the length of the input string.
The variable leng is printed as output.
The variable leng is subtracted by 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.next();
		int leng = s.length();
		System.out.print(s.charAt(0));
		System.out.print(leng-2);
		System.out.println(s.charAt(leng-1));
	}

}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```internationalization
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
