The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable k. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable k as output, which is 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
