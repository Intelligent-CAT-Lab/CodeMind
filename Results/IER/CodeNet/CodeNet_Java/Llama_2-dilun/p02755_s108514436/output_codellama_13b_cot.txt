The variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 1 to Integer.MAX_VALUE to check each integer mid in this range.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the consumption rate of the current integer mid with the function consumptionRate(mid,8) and consumptionRate(mid,10).
If the consumption rate of mid is 2 and 2, it returns the value of mid as the output.
If the consumption rate of mid is less than 2 and 2, it increases the value of low by 1.
If the consumption rate of mid is greater than 2 and 2, it decreases the value of high by 1.
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of ans as output, which is 10.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
