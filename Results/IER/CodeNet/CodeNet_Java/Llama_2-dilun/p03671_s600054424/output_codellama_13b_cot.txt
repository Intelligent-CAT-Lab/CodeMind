The variable a, b and c are initialized with 700, 600 and 780 respectively according to the input.
The variable result is initialized with 0.
The variable result is calculated as a+b+c-max(a, max(b, c)).
The variable result is printed as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import static java.lang.Math.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		// 入力
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		
		// 計算
		int result = 0;
		result = a+b+c-max(a, max(b, c));
		
		// 出力
		System.out.println(result);
	}

}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```700 600 780
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
