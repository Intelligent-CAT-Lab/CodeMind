The variable r, d and x are initialized with 2, 10 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of x by multiplying r and x and subtracting d.
Then it prints the value of x.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int r = sc.nextInt();
		int d = sc.nextInt();
		int x = sc.nextInt();

		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			x = r * x - d;
			System.out.println(x);
		}

		sc.close();
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 10 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
