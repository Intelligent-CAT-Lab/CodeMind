    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import static java.lang.System.*;

public class Main {
	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		out.println(sc.nextInt()+sc.nextInt()+sc.nextInt());
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 10 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
