The variable a, b and k are initialized with 2, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if k is greater than or equal to a. If it is, it subtracts k from b and sets a to 0. Otherwise, it subtracts k from a.
Then it checks if b is less than 0. If it is, it sets b to 0.
Finally, it prints the value of a and b.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*; 

class Main{
public static void main(String[] args){
	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        long a=sc.nextLong();
        long b=sc.nextLong();
		long k=sc.nextLong();
	
 	if(k>=a){
      	b=b-(k-a);
        a=0;
    	}else{
     	a=a-k;

	if(b<0){
    	b=0;

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
