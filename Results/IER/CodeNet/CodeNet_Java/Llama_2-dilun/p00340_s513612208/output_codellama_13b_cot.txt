The variable e[] is initialized with 1, 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable e[i].
It checks if the value of variable e[1] is equal to the value of variable e[2] and the value of variable e[3] is equal to the value of variable e[4].
If it does, it prints "yes" as output.
If it does not, it prints "no" as output.
<<<Output>>>
no

Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int e[] = new int[5] ;
        for(int i = 1;i<=4;i++){
            e[i] = scan.nextInt();
        }
        if(e[1]==e[2]&&e[3]==e[4]||e[1]==e[4]&&e[2]==e[3]||e[1]==e[3]&&e[2]==e[4]){
            System.out.println("yes");

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
