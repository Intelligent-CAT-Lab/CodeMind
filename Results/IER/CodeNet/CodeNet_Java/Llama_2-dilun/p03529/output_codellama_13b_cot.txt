The variable n and variable k are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable l by calling the function f(n,k).
It initializes a 2D array dp with the size of n+1 and l+1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by calling the function powerMod(k+1,i-1).
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to l to check each integer u in this range. The value of variable u is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by calling the function dp[i-1][u+(u+j)/i].
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to Math.min(i,k) to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by calling the function ((u+j)%i)*m%MOD.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to Math.min(i,k) to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by calling the function t+=dp[i-1][u]+(j+u)*m.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to Math.min(i,k) to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by calling the function t=(t+dp[i-1][u]+(j+u)*m)%MOD.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to l to check each integer u in this range. The value of variable u is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by calling the function dp[i][u]=t.
