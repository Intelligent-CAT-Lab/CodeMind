The variable num, variable blue and variable red are initialized with 8, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the remainder of the division of num by (blue+red) and assigns it to variable remainder.
It calculates the number of blue by the division of num by (blue+red) and assigns it to variable countBlue.
If the remainder is greater than or equal to blue, it adds blue to variable countBlue.
Otherwise, it adds the remainder to variable countBlue.
It prints the value of variable countBlue as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//入力の読み込み
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int num = sc.nextInt();
		int blue = sc.nextInt();
		int red = sc.nextInt();

		//青と赤のセットを置いた際の余りの数で判断
		int remainder = num%(blue+red);  //置いた際の余り
		int countBlue = num/(blue+red)*blue;  //上記の際の青の数

		if(remainder >= blue) {  //余りが青の数よりも多い場合
			countBlue += blue;  //全ての青の数を足す
		}
		else {                      //余りが青よりも少ない場合
			countBlue += remainder;  //余りの分だけ青を足す
		}
		System.out.print(countBlue);
		sc.close();
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
