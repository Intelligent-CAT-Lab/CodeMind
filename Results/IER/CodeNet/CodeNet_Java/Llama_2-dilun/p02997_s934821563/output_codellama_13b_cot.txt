The variable n and variable k are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 5 to calculate the number of pairs of integers (u, v) such that u + v = n.
The number of pairs is calculated as (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2.
It checks if the number of pairs is less than k. If it is, it prints -1 as output.
Otherwise, it enters a while loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to calculate the number of pairs of integers (u, v) such that u + v = n.
The number of pairs is calculated as (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2.
It checks if the number of pairs is less than k. If it is, it prints -1 as output.
Otherwise, it adds the pair (from, to) to the list l.
It decreases the value of variable now by 1.
It checks if the value of variable to is equal to the value of variable n. If it is, it increments the value of variable from by 1.
Otherwise, it increments the value of variable to by 1.
It checks if the value of variable now is less than k. If it is, it prints -1 as output.
Otherwise, it prints the size of the list l.
It iterates through the list l and prints each pair (u, v) in the list.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
