The variable N and variable K are initialized with 7 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable N is divisible by variable K. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to 0. Otherwise, it sets the value of variable ans to 1.
It prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int N = sc.nextInt();
    int K = sc.nextInt();
    int ans;

    if(N % K == 0){
      ans = 0;
    }else{
      ans = 1;
    }

    System.out.println(ans);
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
