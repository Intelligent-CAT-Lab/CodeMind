The variable MAX is initialized with 10000002.
The boolean array isPrime is initialized with all true values.
The first two elements of the array are initialized with false values.
The for loop iterates from 2 to MAX and checks if the current value of i is prime.
If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it checks if the current value of i is a multiple of the next prime number.
If it is, it sets the value of the next prime number to false.

The while loop iterates until the end of the input.
It reads the next integer N from the input and sets the variable ans to 0.
It iterates from 3 to N and checks if the current value of p is prime.
If it is, it checks if the next prime number is 2.
If it is, it adds 2 to the variable ans.

It prints the value of variable ans as output.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
