The variable testNumber is initialized with 3.
The variable in is initialized with the input stream of the first line of the input.
The variable out is initialized with the output stream of the second line of the input.
The variable solver is initialized with a new instance of ABC086AProduct.
The variable solver.solve is called with the variable testNumber, the variable in and the variable out as parameters.
