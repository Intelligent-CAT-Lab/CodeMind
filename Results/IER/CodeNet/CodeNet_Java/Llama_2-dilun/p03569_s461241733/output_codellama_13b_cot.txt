The input is "xabxa".
The variable s is initialized with 0 and the variable f is initialized with 3.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
The variable c is initialized with the character array of the input.

The while loop iterates from 0 to 3.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the character at the current position of variable s and the character at the current position of variable f are the same.
If they are the same, it increments the value of variable s and decrements the value of variable f.
If they are not the same, it checks if the character at the current position of variable f is 'x' and the character at the current position of variable s is not 'x'.
If they are not the same, it returns -1.
If the character at the current position of variable f is 'x' and the character at the current position of variable s is not 'x', it increments the value of variable count and decrements the value of variable f.
If the character at the current position of variable f is not 'x' and the character at the current position of variable s is 'x', it increments the value of variable count and increments the value of variable s.

After the loop finishes, it returns the value of variable count, which is 2.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```xabxa
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
