The variable a and variable b are initialized with -13 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the maximum value of a and b by comparing a+b, a-b and a*b.
It prints the maximum value of a and b, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
  public static void main(String args[]){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int max = a+b;
    if(max<a-b)max = a-b;   
    if(max<a*b)max = a*b;
    System.out.println(max);
  } 
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-13 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
