The variable a, variable t and variable r are initialized with 180, 120 and 90 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the quotient of variable t and variable a and stores it in variable q.
It calculates the product of variable r and variable q and stores it in variable p.
It prints the value of variable p as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        double t = sc.nextInt();
        int r = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(t / a * r);
    }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```180 120 90
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
