The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 6, 4 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the difference between variable a and variable b, which is 2.
It calculates the difference between variable c and variable a-b, which is 0.
It checks if the difference between variable c and variable a-b is less than 0.
If it is, it prints 0 as output.
If it is not, it prints the difference between variable c and variable a-b as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c =sc.nextInt();
        //System.out.println(max);
        if(c-(a-b)<0){
            System.out.println("0");
        }else{
        System.out.println(c-(a-b));
        }

    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 4 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
