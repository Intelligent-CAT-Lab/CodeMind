The variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a * b is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Zero".
It checks if a is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "Positive".
It checks if the difference between a and b is odd. If it is, it prints "Positive".
Otherwise, it prints "Negative".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);) {
            new Main().solve(sc);
        }
    }

    void solve(Scanner sc) {
        long a = sc.nextLong();
        long b = sc.nextLong();

        if (a * b <= 0l) {
            System.out.println("Zero");
            return;
        }

        if (a > 0l) {
            System.out.println("Positive");
            return;
        }

        if ((b - a) % 2l == 1l) {
            System.out.println("Positive");
        } else {

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
