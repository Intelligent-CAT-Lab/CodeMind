The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of nComb by multiplying n with (n-1) and then dividing it by 2.
It calculates the value of mComb by multiplying m with (m-1) and then dividing it by 2.
It prints the sum of nComb and mComb as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		try(Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
			

			int n = sc.nextInt();
			int m = sc.nextInt();

			int nComb = n * (n-1) / 2;
			int mComb = m * (m-1) / 2;
			
			System.out.println(nComb + mComb);
			
		}
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
