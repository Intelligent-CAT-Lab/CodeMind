The variable N is initialized with 111.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 8 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of N is greater than THRESHOLD * i and less than or equal to THRESHOLD * (i + 1). If it does, it prints the value of THRESHOLD * (i + 1) as output. The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of THRESHOLD * 9 as output, which is 1000.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    static int N;
    static int THRESHOLD = 111;

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        N = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            if(N > THRESHOLD * i && N <= THRESHOLD * (i + 1)) {
                System.out.println(THRESHOLD * (i + 1));
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```111
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
