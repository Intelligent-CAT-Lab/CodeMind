The variable a, b and c are initialized with 4, 12 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1000000000 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable d.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable e.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable f.
Then it assigns the value of variable d to variable a, the value of variable e to variable b and the value of variable f to variable c.
Then it checks if the value of variable a is equal to the value of variable b and the value of variable b is equal to the value of variable c.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable a, b and c are all odd numbers.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000 - 1.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000 - 2.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000 - 3.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000 - 4.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000 - 5.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000 - 6.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000 - 7.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000 - 8.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000 - 9.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000 - 10.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000 - 11.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000 - 12.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000 - 13.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
If it does not, it checks if the value of variable i is equal to 1000000000 - 14.
If it does, it
