The variable p is initialized with 5700.
It prints the value of p / 500 * 500, which is 285000.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int p = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(p / 500 * 500);
	}
}


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5700
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
