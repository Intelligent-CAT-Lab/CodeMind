The variable cnt is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the power of i by multiplying i with itself and then modulo with the product of 10^9 and 7.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of power as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int cnt = sc.nextInt();
        double power = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= cnt; i++) {
            power = (power*i)%(Math.pow(10, 9) + 7);
        }
        System.out.println((int)power);
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
