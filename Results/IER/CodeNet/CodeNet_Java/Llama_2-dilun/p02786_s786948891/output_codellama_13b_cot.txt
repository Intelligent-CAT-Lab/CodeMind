The variable h is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until h is greater than or equal to t.
It calculates the value of t by multiplying it by 2.
It calculates the value of ans by adding t to ans.
It prints the value of ans as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		long h=sc.nextLong();
		long ans=0;
		long t=1;
		while(h>=t){
			ans+=t;
			t*=2;
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
