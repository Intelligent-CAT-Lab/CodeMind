The variable s is initialized with the input string "ASSA".
It sorts the string s by using Arrays.sort(s) method.
It checks if the first character of the sorted string is equal to the second character and the third character is equal to the first character.
If it is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			sum += arr[i];
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 2 3 4 5```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable n is initialized with 3.
It initializes the array arr with 3 elements.
It iterates from 0 to 2 to fill the array with the input values.
It iterates from 0 to 2 to calculate the sum of the elements in the array.
It prints the sum of the array elements.
