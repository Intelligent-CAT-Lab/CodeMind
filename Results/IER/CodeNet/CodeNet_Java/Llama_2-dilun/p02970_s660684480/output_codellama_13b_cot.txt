The variable n and variable d are initialized with 6 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until n becomes 0.
Inside the while loop, it increments the variable ans by 1.
Then it calculates the value of n by subtracting 1 from n and multiplying it by 2*d.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        solve();
    }

    private static void solve() {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = input.nextInt();
        int d = input.nextInt();

        int ans = 0;

        while(n > 0) {
        	ans++;
        	n = n - 1 - 2*d;
        }

        System.out.println(ans);

    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
