The variable x is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It calculates the value of kakeru by multiplying x with itself three times.
It prints the value of kakeru as output, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	
	public void solve(){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int x=sc.nextInt();
		int kakeru;
		kakeru=x*x*x;
		System.out.println(kakeru);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Main obj=new Main();
		obj.solve();
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
