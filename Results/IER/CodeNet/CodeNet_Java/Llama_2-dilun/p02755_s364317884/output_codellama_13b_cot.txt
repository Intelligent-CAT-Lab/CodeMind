The variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable tax8pricemin by dividing the value of variable a by 0.08.
It calculates the value of variable tax8pricemax by adding 1 to the value of variable a and then dividing the result by 0.08.
It iterates from variable tax8pricemin to variable tax8pricemax to check each integer i in this range.
It calculates the value of variable tax8 by multiplying the value of variable i by 0.08.
It calculates the value of variable tax10 by multiplying the value of variable i by 0.1.
It checks if the value of variable tax8 is equal to the value of variable a and the value of variable tax10 is equal to the value of variable b.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
The condition is met when i is 20.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable i as output, which is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        int tax8pricemin = (int)(((double)a) / 0.08);
        int tax8pricemax = (int)(((double)a + 1) / 0.08);

        for(int i = tax8pricemin ; i < tax8pricemax; i++){
            int tax8 = (int)(i * 0.08);
            int tax10 = (int)(i * 0.1);

            if(tax8 == a && tax10 == b){
                System.out.println(i);
                System.exit(0);
            }
        }
        System.out.println(-1);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
