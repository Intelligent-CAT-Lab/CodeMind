The variable N and variable D are initialized with 6 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable ans by dividing N by (D * 2 + 1.0).
It sets the scale of variable ans to 0 and uses the rounding mode CEILING to round the value of ans.
It prints the value of ans as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		final int N = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
		final int D = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());

		BigDecimal ans = BigDecimal.valueOf(N / (D * 2 + 1.0));
		ans =  ans.setScale(0, RoundingMode.CEILING);
		System.out.println(ans);


	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
