The variable N is initialized with 1 according to the input. And variable d1 and variable x are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable N.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger N by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable ans.
Then it calculates the value of variable d1 by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable d1.
Then it calculates the value of variable x by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable x.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		double d1 = sc.nextInt();
		double x = sc.nextInt();
		
		double ans = 0;
		
		for(; N>0; N--) {
			ans += d1 + (N-0.5)*x;
			d1 = ((2*N+2)*d1 + 5*x)/(2*N);
			x = ((double)N+2)/N*x;
		}
		
		System.out.println(ans);
		sc.close();
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
