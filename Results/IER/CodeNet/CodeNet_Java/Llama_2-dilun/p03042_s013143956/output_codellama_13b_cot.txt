The variable m is initialized with 1905 according to the input. And variable y is initialized with 0.
It checks if m is less than 12 and y is less than 12 and y is greater than 0 and m is greater than 0.
If it is true, it prints "AMBIGUOUS".
If m is greater than 0 and m is less than 12, it prints "YYMM".
If y is greater than 0 and y is less than 12, it prints "MMYY".
If none of the above conditions is met, it prints "NA".
<<<Output>>>
AMBIGUOUS

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int m = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int[] dp = new int[m + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] <= i) {
                    dp[i] += dp[i - arr[j]];
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(dp[m]);
    }

</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 10 10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input. And variable m and variable k are initialized with 10 respectively.
It initializes the array arr with 10 elements and each element is initialized with 0.
It initializes the array dp with 10 elements and each element is initialized with 1.
It iterates from 1 to m and calculates the sum of dp[i] for each i.
It iterates from 0 to n and calculates the sum of dp[i] for each i.
It prints the final value of dp[m].
<<<Output>>>
