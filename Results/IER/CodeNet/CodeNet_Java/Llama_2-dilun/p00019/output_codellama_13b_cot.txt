The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 5 to 1 to check each integer N in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans by repeatedly multiplying N with itself.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		//input
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		//calculation
		Long ans = 1L;
		for(Long N = sc.nextLong();N>1;N--){
			ans *= N;
		}
		//output
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
