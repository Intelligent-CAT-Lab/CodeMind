The variable s is initialized with the input string "BBBWW".
The variable c is initialized with a character array of length s.length().
The variable count is initialized with 0.

It iterates from 1 to s.length() to check each character in the string.
If the current character is not equal to the previous character, it increments the variable count.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = scan.next();
		char[] c = new char[s.length()];
		for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
			c[i] = s.charAt(i);
		}
		int count = 0;
		for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
			if (c[i]!= c[i-1]) {
				count++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```BBBWW
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
