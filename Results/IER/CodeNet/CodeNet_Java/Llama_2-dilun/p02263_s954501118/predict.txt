The input is 1 2 +. The first input is 1, which is pushed into the stack. The second input is 2 +, which is split into two parts. The first part is 2, which is pushed into the stack. The second part is +, which is pushed into the stack.
Then the code checks the top two elements in the stack. The first element is 1, which is popped out. The second element is +, which is popped out.
Then the code calculates the result of 1 + 2, which is 3. The result is pushed into the stack.
Then the code checks the top element in the stack. The top element is +, which is popped out.
Then the code calculates the result of 3 + 2, which is 5. The result is pushed into the stack.
