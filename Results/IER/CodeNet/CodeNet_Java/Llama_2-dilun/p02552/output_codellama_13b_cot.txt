The variable n is initialized with 1.
It checks if the value of variable n is 0. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
Otherwise, it prints 0 as output.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
