The variable a is initialized with 1000.
It checks if the value of variable a is greater than or equal to 1200. If it is, it prints "ARC" as output. Otherwise, it prints "ABC" as output.
<<<Output>>>
ABC
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[INST]
    Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		//BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		//String line = br.readLine();
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

		int a = scan.nextInt();
		

		if(a>=1200)
			System.out.println("ARC");
		else
			System.out.println("ABC");
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
