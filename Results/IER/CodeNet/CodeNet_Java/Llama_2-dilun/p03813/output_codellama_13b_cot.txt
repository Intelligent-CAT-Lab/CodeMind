The variable s is initialized with a Scanner object.
The variable s.nextInt() is called to read the first integer input.
The condition s.nextInt()<1200 is evaluated.
If the condition is true, the string "ABC" is printed.
If the condition is false, the string "ARC" is printed.
<<<Output>>>
ABC

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	static Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(s.nextInt()<1200?"ABC":"ARC");
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
