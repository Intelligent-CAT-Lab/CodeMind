The variable n is initialized with 105 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 105 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of divisors of the current interger tmp by repeatedlly extracting the divisors of number with a while loop.
Then it checks if the number of divisors of tmp is 8. If it does, it adds 1 to variable ans. The condition is met when tmp is 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 14, 16, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56, 63, 70, 84, 91, 100, 105.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int ans = 0;
		for(int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
			if(i % 2 == 1) {
				int tmp = i;
				int[] div = new int[n + 1];
				for(int j = 1; j < n + 1; j++) {
					div[j] = 0;
				}
				while(tmp!= 1) {
					for(int j = 2; j < tmp + 1; j++) {
						if(tmp % j == 0) {
							div[j]++;
							tmp /= j;
							break;
						}
					}
				}
				int count = 1;
				for(int j = 2; j < n + 1; j++) {
					count *= div[j] + 1;
				}
				if(count == 8) {
					ans++;
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```105
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
