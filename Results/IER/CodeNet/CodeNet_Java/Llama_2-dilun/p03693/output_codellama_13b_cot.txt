The variable r, g and b are initialized with 4, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It calculates the sum of the variables r, g and b and stores it in variable sum.
It checks if the value of variable sum is divisible by 4. If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
        int r=scan.nextInt()*100;
        int g=scan.nextInt()*10;
        int b=scan.nextInt();
 
        int sum=r+g+b;
        System.out.println(sum%4==0?"YES":"NO");
 
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
