The variable h, w, s and t are initialized with 4, 5, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the product of h and w is odd and the sum of s and w is odd. If both conditions are met, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
The condition is met when h = 4, w = 5, s = 2 and t = 3.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, m and k are initialized with 3, 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It creates an array arr with 3 elements. It initializes the first element of arr with 0, the second element with 1 and the third element with 2.
It creates a dp array with m + 1 elements. It initializes the first element of dp with 1.
It iterates from 1 to m to calculate the value of dp[i].
Inside the loop, it iterates from 0 to n to calculate the value of dp[i] for each element of arr.
If the value of arr[j] is less than or equal to i, it adds the value of dp[i - arr[j]] to dp[i].
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of dp[k], which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
