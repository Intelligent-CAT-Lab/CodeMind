The variable num1 is initialized with 575.
The variable a is initialized with the first character of the input, which is '5'.
The variable b is initialized with the second character of the input, which is '7'.
The variable c is initialized with the third character of the input, which is '5'.
The variable num2 is initialized with 100*c+10*b+a.
The value of variable num2 is 5750.
The condition is met when num1==num2, which is true.
So the output is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    String str = sc.nextLine();
    int num1 = Integer.parseInt(str);
    int a = Integer.parseInt(""+str.charAt(0));
    int b = Integer.parseInt(""+str.charAt(1));
    int c = Integer.parseInt(""+str.charAt(2));
    int num2 = 100*c+10*b+a;
    if(num1==num2){
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }else{
      System.out.println("No");
    }
  }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```575
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
