The variable N, variable X and variable T are initialized with 20, 12 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable N is divisible by variable X. If it is, it prints the value of variable N divided by variable X multiplied by variable T.
Otherwise, it prints the value of variable N divided by variable X multiplied by variable T plus variable T.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
                Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

                int N = scan.nextInt();
                int X = scan.nextInt();
                int T = scan.nextInt();

                if (N%X == 0) {
                	System.out.println(N/X * T);
                } else {
                	System.out.println(N/X * T + T);
                }

                scan.close();

        }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 12 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
