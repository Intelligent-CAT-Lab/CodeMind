The variable S is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It calculates the value of S * S * S, which is 8.
It prints the value of S * S * S as output, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 4```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
