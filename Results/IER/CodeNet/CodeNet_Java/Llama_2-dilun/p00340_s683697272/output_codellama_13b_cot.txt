The variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 1, 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a == b && c == d, a == c && b == d and a == d && b == c.
It prints "yes" if any of the conditions is met.
It prints "no" if none of the conditions is met.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
