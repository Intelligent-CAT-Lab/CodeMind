The variable H1, M1, H2 and M2 are initialized with 10, 0, 15 and 0 respectively according to the input. And variable K is initialized with 30.
It calculates the difference between H2 and H1, which is 5. Then it calculates the difference between M2 and M1, which is 0.
It calculates the difference between K and 60, which is 30.
It calculates the sum of the difference between H2 and H1 and the difference between M2 and M1, which is 5+0=5.
It calculates the difference between the sum of the difference between H2 and H1 and the difference between M2 and M1 and 60, which is 5-30=-25.
It prints the final value of variable ans, which is -25.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int H1 = sc.nextInt();
    int M1 = sc.nextInt();
    int H2 = sc.nextInt();
    int M2 = sc.nextInt();
    int K = sc.nextInt();
    
    int ans = (H2-H1)*60+(M2-M1)-K;
    System.out.println(ans);
  }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 0 15 0 30
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
