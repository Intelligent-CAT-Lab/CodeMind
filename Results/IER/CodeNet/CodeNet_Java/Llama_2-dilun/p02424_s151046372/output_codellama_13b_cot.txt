The variable x and y are initialized with 8 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It prints the binary representation of x & y, which is 00000000000000000000000000000000.
It prints the binary representation of x | y, which is 00000000000000000000000000000000.
It prints the binary representation of x ^ y, which is 00000000000000000000000000000000.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n and m are initialized with 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It initializes the array arr with 3 elements.
It iterates from 0 to 2 to fill the array arr with 0, 1 and 2 respectively.
It iterates from 0 to 3 to calculate the sum of the elements in the array arr.
It prints the sum, which is 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
