The variable n is initialized with 21 according to the input.
It calculates the square root of n and checks if the floor of the square root is equal to the square root.
Since the floor of the square root of 21 is 4.472135954999577, which is not equal to the square root of 21, the output is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.next() + sc.next();

		int n = Integer.parseInt(s);
		double sqr = Math.sqrt((double) n);
		if (Math.floor(sqr) == sqr) {
			System.out.println("Yes");
		} else {
			System.out.println("No");
		}

		sc.close();
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 21
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
