The variable a, b and c are initialized with 50, 100 and 120 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the sum of the variables a and b, which is 150.
It then checks if the sum is greater than or equal to the value of variable c. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	  public static void main(String args[]){
      	Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
            
        int a = scan.nextInt();
        int b = scan.nextInt();
        int c = scan.nextInt();
        
        String cnt;
        
        if( a + b >= c )cnt = "Yes";
        else 
          cnt = "No";
            
        System.out.println(cnt);
        
      }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```50 100 120
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
