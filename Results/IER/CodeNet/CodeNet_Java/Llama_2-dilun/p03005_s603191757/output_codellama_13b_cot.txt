import java.util.*;

public class Main {

		int[] array = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			array[i] = sc.nextInt();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
