The variable s is initialized with the input string "takahashi".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each character in the string.
Inside the for loop, it prints the character at the current index of the string.
The output is "takahashi".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.nextLine();
        
        for(int i = 0;i < 3;i++)System.out.print(s.charAt(i));
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```takahashi
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
