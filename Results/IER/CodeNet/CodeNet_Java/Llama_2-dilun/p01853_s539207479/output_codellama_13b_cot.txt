The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable m is initialized with 100.
The array ns is initialized with 3 elements.
The first element of the array is initialized with 100.
The second element of the array is initialized with 100.
The third element of the array is initialized with 100.
The output is 100 100 100.

/**
 * B :??????????????? / Lie with Mean Value
 */
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		//?????????: 0 - m

		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();

		int[] ns = new int[n];

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
