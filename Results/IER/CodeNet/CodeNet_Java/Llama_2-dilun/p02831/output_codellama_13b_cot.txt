The variable A and B are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to Math.max(A, B) to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is a divisor of both A and B. If it is, it sets the variable gcd to i.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the lcm of A and B by dividing A and B by the variable gcd.
It prints the value of variable lcm as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n;
		n = sc.nextInt();
		sc.close();

		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
			sum += i;
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current integer i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable sum as output, which is 55.
<<<Output>>>
