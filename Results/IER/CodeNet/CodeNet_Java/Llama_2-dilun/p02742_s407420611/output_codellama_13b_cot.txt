The variable H and W are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if H or W is 1. If it is, it prints 1 as output and returns.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable h by dividing H by 2 and adding 1.
It iterates from 1 to W and calculates the value of variable ans by adding h to ans if i is even and h - 1 to ans if i is odd.
It prints the final value of variable ans as output.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N and M are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It initializes the 2D array dp with the value 1.
It iterates from 1 to N and iterates from 1 to M.
It checks if i is 1 or j is 1. If it is, it prints 1 as output and returns.
Otherwise, it checks if i is 1. If it is, it prints dp[i][j - 1] as output and returns.
Otherwise, it checks if j is 1. If it is, it prints dp[i - 1][j] as output and returns.
Otherwise, it checks if i is N and j is M. If it is, it prints 1 as output and returns.
Otherwise, it checks if i is N and j is not M. If it is, it prints dp[i - 1][j - 1] as output and returns.
Otherwise, it checks if i is not N and j is M. If it is, it prints dp[i - 1][j] as output and returns.
Otherwise, it checks if i is not N and j is not M. If it is, it prints dp
