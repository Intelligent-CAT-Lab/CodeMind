The variable W, H, x, y and r are initialized with 5, 4, 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the condition (x-r) >= 0 && (x+r) <= W && (y-r) >= 0 && (y+r) <= H is met.
The condition is met when r = 1.
So it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner cin = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = cin.nextInt();
		int M = cin.nextInt();
		int K = cin.nextInt();
		int[][] arr = new int[N][M];
		for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			for(int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
				arr[i][j] = cin.nextInt();
			}
		}
		int[][] dp = new int[N][M];
		for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			for(int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
				if(arr[i][j] == 0) {
					dp[i][j] = 0;
				}else {
					dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j];
				}
			}
		}
		int ans = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			for(int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
				if(arr[i][j] == 0) {
					ans = ans + dp[i][j];
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4 2 2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, M, K and arr are initialized with 5, 4, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It initializes the 2D array dp with all 0s.
It iterates through the 2D array arr and calculates the value of dp[i][j] for each element of arr[i][j].
If arr[i][j] is 0, it sets dp[i][j] to 0.
Otherwise, it sets dp[i][j] to the sum of dp[i][j-1] and dp[i-1][j].
After the loop finishes, it iterates through the 2D array dp and calculates the value of ans for each element of dp[i][j].
If dp[i][j] is 0, it adds dp[i][j] to ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
