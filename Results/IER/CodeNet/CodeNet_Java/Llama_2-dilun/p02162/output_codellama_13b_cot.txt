The variable t1 and t2 are initialized with 9 and 8 respectively according to the input.
The variable r1 and r2 are initialized with 1000 and 999 respectively according to the input.
The condition r1 == -1 || r2 == -1 is true, so r1 and r2 are set to -t1 and -t2 respectively.
The condition r1 == r2 is false, so the output is "Draw".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int t1 = sc.nextInt();
		int t2 = sc.nextInt();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9 8 1000 999
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
