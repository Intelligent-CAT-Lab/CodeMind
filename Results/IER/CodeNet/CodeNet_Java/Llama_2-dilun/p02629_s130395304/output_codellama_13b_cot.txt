The variable N is initialized with 2.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 2 to 0 to check each integer N in this range.
Inside the while loop, it decreases the value of N by 1.
Then it calculates the remainder of N divided by 26 and adds it to variable sb.
Then it divides the value of N by 26 and checks if it is less than 0. If it is, it breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the reverse of variable sb as output, which is "z".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long N = sc.nextLong();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while(0 < N) {
            N--;
            sb.append((char)('a' + N%26));
            N /= 26;
        }
        System.out.println(sb.reverse());
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
