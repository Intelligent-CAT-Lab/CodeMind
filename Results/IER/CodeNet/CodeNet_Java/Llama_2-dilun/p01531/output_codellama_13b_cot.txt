The input is 5R2D.
The first character is 5, which is the index of the first row of the array in.
The second character is R, which is the index of the first column of the array in.
The third character is 2, which is the index of the second row of the array in.
The fourth character is D, which is the index of the second column of the array in.
The code prints the characters in the array in[5][R] and in[2][D].
The output is:
```
a

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
        new Main().run();
    }
	String[][] in = {
			{"wa","nn","wo","",""},
			{"a","u","o","i","e"},
			{"ka","ku","ko","ki","ke"},
			{"sa","su","so","si","se"},
			{"ta","tu","to","ti","te"},
			{"na","nu","no","ni","ne"},
			{"ha","hu","ho","hi","he"},
			{"ma","mu","mo","mi","me"},
			{"ya","yu","yo","",""},
			{"ra","ru","ro","ri","re"}
	};
	public void run(){
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		while(scan.hasNext()){
			char[] fl = scan.nextLine().toCharArray();
			for(int i = 0;i < fl.length;i+=2){
				int c = 0;
				switch(fl[i+1]){
				case 'T':c = 0;break;
				case 'L':c = 3;break;
				case 'U':c = 1;break;
				case 'R':c = 4;break;
				case 'D':c = 2;break;
				default:break;
				}
				System.out.print(in[fl[i]-'0'][c]);
			}
			System.out.println();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5R2D
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
