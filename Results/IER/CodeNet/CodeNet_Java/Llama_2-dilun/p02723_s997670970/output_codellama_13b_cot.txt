The variable s is initialized with the input string "sippuu".
It checks if the third and fourth characters of the string are the same.
It checks if the fifth and sixth characters of the string are the same.
If the third and fourth characters are the same and the fifth and sixth characters are the same, it prints "Yes".
Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);    //scanner
        String s = sc.next();
        if(s.charAt(2)==s.charAt(3) && s.charAt(4)==s.charAt(5)){
            System.out.println("Yes");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```sippuu
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
