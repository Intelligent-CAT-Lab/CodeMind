The variable A, variable B, variable H and variable M are initialized with 3, 4, 9 and 0 respectively according to the input.
The variable mins is initialized with 60*9+0, which is 540.
The variable M_angle is initialized with M*6, which is 54.
The variable H_angle is initialized with 540*0.5, which is 270.

The variable x1 is initialized with 3*Math.cos(Math.toRadians(270)), which is 2.386.
The variable y1 is initialized with 3*Math.sin(Math.toRadians(270)), which is 1.732.
The variable x2 is initialized with 4*Math.cos(Math.toRadians(54)), which is 3.846.
The variable y2 is initialized with 4*Math.sin(Math.toRadians(54)), which is 2.538.

The variable x2-x1 is initialized with 3.846-2.386, which is 1.46.
The variable y2-y1 is initialized with 2.538-1.732, which is 0.806.

The variable sqrt is initialized with Math.sqrt((1.46*1.46) + (0.806*0.806)), which is 1.732.

The variable sqrt is printed as output, which is 1.732.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4 9 0
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
