The variable num is initialized with the array of integers {1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512,  9, 27, 81, 243, 729,  16, 64, 256, 1024, 25, 125, 625,  36, 216,  49, 343,  64, 512,  81, 729,  100, 1000, 121,  144,  169,  196,  225,  256,  289,  324,  361,  400, 441, 484,  529,  576,  625,  676,  729,  784,  841, 900,  961}.
The variable X is initialized with the input 10.
The variable max is initialized with -1.
The for loop iterates from num.length to 0.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable n, which is the last element of the array num.
It checks if the value of variable n is less than or equal to the value of variable X.
If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the value of variable n.
It breaks the loop when the value of variable n is less than the value of variable X.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable max as output, which is 100.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int[] num = {1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512,  9, 27, 81, 243, 729,  16, 64, 256, 1024, 25, 125, 625,  36, 216,  49, 343,  64, 512,  81, 729,  100, 1000, 121,  144,  169,  196,  225,  256,  289,  324,  361,  400, 441, 484,  529,  576,  625,  676,  729,  784,  841, 900,  961};
        Arrays.sort(num);
        int X = sc.nextInt();
        int max = -1;
        for(int i = num.length; i > 0; i--){
            int n = num[i - 1];
            if(n <= X){

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
