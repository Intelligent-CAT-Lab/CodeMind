The variable a and variable b are initialized with 20 and 30 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the absolute value of a-b, which is 10.
It prints the absolute value of a-b as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int ans=0;

        int a=sc.nextInt();
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        
        ans=Math.abs(a-b);

        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 30
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
