The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It prints the value of variable n-k+1, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(n-k+1);
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
