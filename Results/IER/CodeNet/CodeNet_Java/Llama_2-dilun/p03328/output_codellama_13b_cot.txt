The variable a and variable b are initialized with 8 and 13 respectively according to the input. And variable n is initialized with b - a, which is 5.
It calculates the value of n * (n + 1) / 2, which is 15.
Then it calculates the value of b - n * (n + 1) / 2, which is 13 - 15 = -2.
Finally, it prints the value of -2.
<<<Output>>>
-2

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = scanner.nextInt();
    int b = scanner.nextInt();
    int n = b - a;
    System.out.println(n * (n + 1) / 2 - b);
  }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 13
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
