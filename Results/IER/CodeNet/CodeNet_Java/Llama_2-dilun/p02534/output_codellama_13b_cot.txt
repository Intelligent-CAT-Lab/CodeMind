The variable K is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it adds "ACL" to the variable answer.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is "ACLACLACL".
<<<Output>>>
ACLACLACL

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        Main m = new Main(sc);
        m.show(m.solve());
        sc.close();
    }
    
	//フィールド
    Scanner sc;
    int K;;
    
    //入力
    Main(Scanner sc) {
        this.sc = sc;
        this.K = sc.nextInt();
    }
    
    //解答処理
    private String solve() {
        String answer = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < K; i++) {
        	answer += "ACL";
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
    
    //出力
    public void show(String answer) {
        System.out.println(answer);
    }

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
