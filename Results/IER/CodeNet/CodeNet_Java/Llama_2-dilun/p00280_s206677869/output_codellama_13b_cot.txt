The input is 2 2.
The first line of code is executed.
The value of variable j is initialized with 2 and the value of variable y is initialized with 2.
The value of variable r is initialized with an empty string.
The value of variable j is compared with 2 and the value of variable y is compared with 2.
Since both are true, the if statement is true and the code inside the if statement is executed.
The value of variable r is printed as output.

Consider the following code:

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

import static java.lang.Integer.parseInt;

/**

			int j, y;
			j = parseInt(line.substring(0, line.indexOf(' ')));
			y = parseInt(line.substring(line.indexOf(' ') + 1));

			play(0, 0, "", j, y);

		}//end while

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
