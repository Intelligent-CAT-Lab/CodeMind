The variable age is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable age is 3, 5 or 7. If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.math.BigDecimal;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
  		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int age = sc.nextInt();
      
      	if(age == 3 || age == 5 || age == 7) {
        	System.out.println("YES");
        } else {
          	System.out.println("NO");
        }

    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
