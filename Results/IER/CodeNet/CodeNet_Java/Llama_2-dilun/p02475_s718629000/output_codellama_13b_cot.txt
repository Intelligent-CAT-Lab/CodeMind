The variable A and variable B are initialized with 5 and 8 respectively according to the input.
It prints the result of the division of variable A by variable B.
<<<Output>>>
0.625

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine());
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine());
		}
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			sum += arr[i];
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It creates an array of size 5 and initializes it with 0.
It iterates from 0 to 4 to read the input of each element of the array.
It iterates from 0 to 4 to calculate the sum of each element of the array.
It prints the final value of variable sum as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
