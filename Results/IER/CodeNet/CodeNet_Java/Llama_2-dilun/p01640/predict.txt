The variable w, h, gx, gy, n; xs, ys; run; are initialized with 10, 10, 0, 0, 10, new int[10], new int[10], "LRLRRRRRR" respectively according to the input.
It enters a run() method and calls the solve() method.
Inside the solve() method, it calls the solve1() method.
Inside the solve1() method, it creates a TreeSet[][] sets1, sets2;
It initializes the sets1[] array with 10 TreeSet objects.
It initializes the sets1[] array with 10 TreeSet objects.
It initializes the sets1[i] array with -1 and h.
It initializes the sets2[i] array with -1 and w.
It iterates through the n array and adds the ys[i] value to the sets1[xs[i]] array.
It iterates through the n array and adds the xs[i] value to the sets2[ys[i]] array.
It adds the gx value to the sets1[gx] array.
It adds the gy value to the sets2[gy] array.
It iterates through the n array and checks if the ys[i] value is in the sets1[xs[i]] array.
If it is, it checks if the ys[i] value is not the same as the py value.
If it is not the same, it checks if the ys[i] value is in the range [py+1, y-1].
If it is in the range, it adds the ys[i] value to the sum.
It iterates through the n array and checks if the xs[i] value is in the sets2[ys[i]] array.
If it is, it checks if the xs[i] value is not the same as the py value.
If it is not the same, it checks if the xs[i] value is in the range [py+1, y-1].
If it is in the range, it adds the xs[i] value to the sum.
It iterates through the run string and checks if the run[k] value is 'L'.
If it is, it checks if the wx value is gx and the wy value is gy.
If it is, it returns true.
It iterates through the run string and checks if the run[k] value is 'R'.
If it is, it checks if the wx value is gx and the wy value is gy.
If it is, it returns true.
It iterates through the run string and checks if the run[k] value is 'L'.
If it is, it checks if the wx value is gx and the wy value is gy.
If it is, it returns true.
It iterates through the run string and checks if the run[k] value is 'R'.
If it is, it checks if the wx value is gx and the wy value is gy.
If it is, it returns true.
It iterates through the run string and checks if the run[k] value is 'L'.
If it is, it checks if the wx value is gx and the wy value is gy.
If it is, it returns true.
It iterates through the run string and checks if the run[k] value is 'R'.
If it is, it checks if the wx value is gx and the wy value is gy.
If it is, it returns true.

If it is, it checks if the wx value is gx and the wy value is gy.
If it is, it returns true.
It iterates through the run string and checks if the run[k] value is 'R'.
If it is, it checks if the wx value is gx and the wy value is gy.
If it is, it returns
