The variable n is initialized with 100.
It calculates the result of n/25, which is 4.
It calculates the result of n%25, which is 5.
It calculates the result of n/10, which is 10.
It calculates the result of n%10, which is 0.
It calculates the result of n/5, which is 2.
It calculates the result of n%5, which is 0.
It prints the final result, which is 45.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
