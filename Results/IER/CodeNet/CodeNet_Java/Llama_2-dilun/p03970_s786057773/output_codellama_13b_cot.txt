The variable s is initialized with the input string.
The variable m is initialized with the string "CODEFESTIVAL2016".
The variable k is initialized with 0.

It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 15 to check each character in the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of the string s is not equal to the character at index i of the string m. If it is not, it increments the variable k.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable k as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
	Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
	String s = scan.next();
	String m ="CODEFESTIVAL2016";
	int k = 0;
	for(int i=0;i<16;i++){
	    if(s.charAt(i)!=m.charAt(i))
		k++;
		//String.valueOf(s.charAt(i));
	}
	System.out.println(k);
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```C0DEFESTIVAL2O16
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
