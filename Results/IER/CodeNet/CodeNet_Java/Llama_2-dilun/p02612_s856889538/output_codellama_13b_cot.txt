The variable n is initialized with 1900 according to the input.
It calculates the remainder of n divided by 1000, which is 0.
Then it calculates the difference between 1000 and 0, which is 1000.
It prints the value of 1000 as output.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String line = sc.nextLine();
      	int n = Integer.parseInt(line);
      
      	int x = n % 1000;
      	int answer = 0;
      	if(x > 0){
          answer = 1000 - x;
        }
      System.out.println(String.valueOf(answer));
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1900
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
