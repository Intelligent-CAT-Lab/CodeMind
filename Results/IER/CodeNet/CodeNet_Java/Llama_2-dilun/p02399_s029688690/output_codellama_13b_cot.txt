The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
Then it calculates the quotient d and remainder r of the division of variable a by variable b.
It also calculates the fraction f of variable a by variable b.
Then it prints the value of d, r and f as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a,b;
		int d,r;
		double f;

		a = sc.nextInt();
		b = sc.nextInt();

		d = a/b;
		r =a%b;
		f = (double)a/(double)b;

		System.out.print(d+" "+r+" ");
		System.out.println(String.format("%.5f", f));


		sc.close();
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
