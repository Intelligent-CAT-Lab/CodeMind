The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable x is initialized with 7.
It calls the function calc(n, x) to calculate the sum of the digits of the number x.
The function first calculates the length of the number x, which is 1 + 4 * ((long)Math.pow(2, n) -1) = 1 + 4 * ((long)Math.pow(2, 2) -1) = 1 + 4 * 3 = 11.
Then it calculates the value of p(n-1), which is 1 +2 * ((long)Math.pow(2, n) -1) = 1 +2 * ((long)Math.pow(2, 2) -1) = 1 +2 * 3 = 5.

It then calls the function calc(n-1, x) to calculate the sum of the digits of the number x.
The function first calculates the length of the number x, which is 1 + 4 * ((long)Math.pow(2, n) -1) = 1 + 4 * ((long)Math.pow(2, 1) -1) = 1 + 4 * 1 = 5.
Then it calculates the value of p(n-1), which is 1 +2 * ((long)Math.pow(2, n) -1) = 1 +2 * ((long)Math.pow(2, 1) -1) = 1 +2 * 1 = 3.

It then calls the function calc(n-1, x) to calculate the sum of the digits of the number x.
The function first calculates the length of the number x, which is 1 + 4 * ((long)Math.pow(2, n) -1) = 1 + 4 * ((long)Math.pow(2, 0) -1) = 1 + 4 * 0 = 0.
Then it calculates the value of p(n-1), which is 1 +2 * ((long)Math.pow(2, n) -1) = 1 +2 * ((long)Math.pow(2, 0) -1) = 1 +2 * 0 = 0.

It then calls the function calc(n-1, x) to calculate the sum of the digits of the number x.
The function first calculates the length of the number x, which is 1 + 4 * ((long)Math.pow(2, n) -1) = 1 + 4 * ((long)Math.pow(2, -1) -1) = 1 + 4 * (-1) = -3.
Then it calculates the value of p(n-1), which is 1 +2 * ((long)Math.pow(2, n) -1) = 1 +2 * ((long)Math.pow(2, -1) -1) = 1 +2 * (-1) = -2.

It then calls the function calc(n-1, x) to calculate the sum of the digits of the number x.
The function first calculates the length of the number x, which is 1 + 4 * ((long)Math.pow(2, n) -1) = 1 + 4 * ((long)Math.pow(2, -2) -1) = 1 + 4 * (-2) = -7.
Then it calculates the value of p(n-1), which is 1 +2 * ((long)Math.pow(2, n) -1) = 1 +2 * ((long)Math.pow(2, -2) -1) = 1 +2 * (-2) = -4.

It then calls the function calc(n-1, x) to calculate the sum of the digits of the number x.
The function first calculates the length of the number x, which is 1 + 4 * ((long)Math.pow(2, n) -1) = 1 + 4 * ((long)Math.pow(2, -3) -1) = 1 + 4 * (-3) = -11.
Then it calculates the value of p(n-1), which is 1 +2 * ((long)Math.pow(2, n) -1) = 1 +2 * ((long)Math.pow(2,
