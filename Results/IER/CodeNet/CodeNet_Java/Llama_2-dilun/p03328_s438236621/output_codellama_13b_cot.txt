The variable a and variable b are initialized with 8 and 13 respectively according to the input.
It calls the function solve(a, b) to calculate the output.
The function solve(a, b) calculates the output by the following formula:
(b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2 - b

The output is calculated as follows:
(13 - 8 + 1) * (13 - 8) / 2 - 13
(5 + 1) * (5) / 2 - 13
6 * 5 / 2 - 13
30 / 2 - 13
15 - 13

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        System.out.println(solve(a, b));

        sc.close();
    }

    static int solve(int a, int b) {
        return (b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2 - b;
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 15
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
