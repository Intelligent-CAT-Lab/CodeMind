The variable s is initialized with the input string.
The variable ch is initialized with the character array of the input string.
The variable x is initialized with 0.

It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character ch[i] is '+'. If it is, it increments the value of variable x.
Otherwise, it checks if the current character ch[i] is '-'. If it is, it decrements the value of variable x.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable x as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.* ;
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    String s = scan.next() ;
    char ch[] = s.toCharArray();
    int x = 0 ;
    for(int i = 0 ; i < s.length() ; i++){
      if(ch[i] == '+')
        x++;
      else if(ch[i]=='-')
        x--;

    System.out.println(x) ;
  }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```+-++
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
