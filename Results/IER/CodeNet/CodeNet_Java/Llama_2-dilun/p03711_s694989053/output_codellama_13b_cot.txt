The variable x and variable y are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable A[i] and variable B[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable x is equal to the value of variable A[i] or variable B[i]. If it does, it adds the string "A" to variable Xans.
It also checks if the value of variable y is equal to the value of variable A[i] or variable B[i]. If it does, it adds the string "A" to variable Yans.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable x is equal to 2. If it does, it adds the string "C" to variable Xans.
It also checks if the value of variable y is equal to 2. If it does, it adds the string "C" to variable Yans.
If the value of variable Xans is equal to the value of variable Yans, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int x, y;

		int B[] = { 4, 6, 9, 11 };
		String Xans, Yans;
		Xans = "";
		Yans = "";
		x = sc.nextInt();
		y = sc.nextInt();

		for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
