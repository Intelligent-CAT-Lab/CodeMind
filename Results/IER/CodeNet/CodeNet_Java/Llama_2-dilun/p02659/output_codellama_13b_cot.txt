    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    long a = sc.nextLong();
    double b = sc.nextDouble();
    long bb = (long)((double)100 * b + 0.1);
    long ans = (a * bb) / (long)100;
    System.out.println(ans);
  }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```198 1.10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
