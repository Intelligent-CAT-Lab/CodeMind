The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable total.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable total.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable total as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自动生成的方法存根
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int N=sc.nextInt();
		int total=0;
		for(int i=1;i<=N;i++) {
			total=total+i;
		}
		System.out.println(total);
	}

}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
