The variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 99999999 to check each integer i in this range.
It checks if the value of variable i is equal to the value of variable A and variable B.
If it does, it prints the value of variable i as output.
The condition is met when i is 16000.
<<<Output>>>
16000

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Main().run();
    }

    private void run() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();

        if(A > B) {
            System.out.println(-1);
            return;
        }

        for(int i = 1; i < 99999999; i ++) {
            if((int)(i * 0.08) == A &&  (int)(i * 0.10) == B) {
                System.out.println(i);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
