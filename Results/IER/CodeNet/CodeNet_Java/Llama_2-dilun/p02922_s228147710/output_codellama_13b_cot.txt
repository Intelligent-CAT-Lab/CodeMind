The variable tap is initialized with 1.
The variable a is initialized with 4 and variable b is initialized with 10.
The while loop iterates until the value of variable tap is less than the value of variable b.
Inside the while loop, it adds the value of variable a to variable tap.
Then it increments the value of variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int ans = 0;
		while(a > 0) {
			ans += a;
			a = a/10;
		}
		System.out.println(ans);

	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable a is initialized with 10 and variable b is initialized with 2.
The while loop iterates until the value of variable a is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it adds the value of variable a to variable ans.
Then it divides the value of variable a by 10 and assigns the result to variable a.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
