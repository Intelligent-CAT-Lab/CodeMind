The variable n is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range.
It calculates the value of variable odd by counting the number of odd numbers in the range [1, 4] and variable notOdd by counting the number of even numbers in the range [1, 4].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable odd / n, which is 0.25.
<<<Output>>>
0.25

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    int n = sc.nextInt();

    int odd = 0;
    int notOdd = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      if (i % 2 == 0) {
        notOdd++;
      } else {
        odd++;
      }
    }
    System.out.println(odd / n);
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
