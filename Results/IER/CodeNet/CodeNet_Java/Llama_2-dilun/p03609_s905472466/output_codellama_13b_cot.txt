The variable sum is initialized with 100-17, which is 83.
Then it checks if the value of variable sum is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 as output. Otherwise, it prints the value of variable sum as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int sum = sc.nextInt()-sc.nextInt();
		if(sum<=0)
			System.out.println(0);
		else
			System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100 17
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
