The variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the product of variable a and variable b, which is 3.
It checks if the product is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Negative" as output.
Otherwise, it checks if variable a is less than 0. If it is, it calculates the difference between variable b and variable a plus 1.
If the difference is odd, it prints "Positive" as output. Otherwise, it prints "Zero" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Positive

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long a = sc.nextLong(), b = sc.nextLong();
		sc.close();
		String ans[] = { "Positive", "Negative", "Zero" };
		int an = 0;
		long tmp = a * b;
		if (tmp <= 0)
			an = 2;
		else {
			if (a < 0) {
				tmp = b - a + 1;
				if (tmp % 2!= 0)
					an = 1;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans[an]);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
