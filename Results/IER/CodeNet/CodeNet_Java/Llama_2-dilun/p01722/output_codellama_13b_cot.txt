The variable n is initialized with 0.
It enters a switch statement and it checks the value of variable n.
If the value of variable n is 0, it prints 1 as output.
If the value of variable n is 1, it prints 2 as output.
If the value of variable n is 2, it prints 1 as output.
If the value of variable n is not 0, 1 or 2, it prints 0 as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		switch (n) {
		case 0:
			System.out.println(1);
			break;
		case 1:
			System.out.println(2);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
