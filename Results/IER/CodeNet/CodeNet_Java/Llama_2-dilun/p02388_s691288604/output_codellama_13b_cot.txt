The variable x is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It prints the value of x*x*x, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x =sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(x*x*x);
    }
 
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
