The variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the remainder of variable a and variable b with respect to 3.
It calculates the sum of variable a and variable b and calculates the remainder of the sum with respect to 3.
It checks if the remainder of variable a, variable b and the sum of variable a and variable b are all 0. If it is, it prints "Possible". Otherwise, it prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Impossible

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
 
    int c = a % 3;
    int d = b % 3;
    int e = ( a + b ) % 3;
 
    if ((c==0) || (d==0) || (e==0) ){
      System.out.println("Possible");
    }
    else {
      System.out.println("Impossible");
    }
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
