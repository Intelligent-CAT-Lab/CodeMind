The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 2, 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the sum of the variables a, b, c and d by adding them together.
It calculates the absolute value of the difference between the sum and the product of the variables a and b multiplied by 2.
It calculates the absolute value of the difference between the sum and the product of the variables a and c multiplied by 2.
It calculates the absolute value of the difference between the sum and the product of the variables a and d multiplied by 2.
It calculates the minimum of the three absolute values.
It prints the minimum value as output, which is 1.
