The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 10, 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the minimum value of variable A and variable B, which is 3.
It calculates the maximum value of variable A and variable B, which is 8.
It calculates the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value, which is 5.
It calculates the minimum value of variable A and variable B, which is 3.
It calculates the maximum value of variable A and variable B, which is 8.
It calculates the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value, which is 5.
It prints the minimum value of variable A and variable B, which is 3.
It prints the maximum value of variable A and variable B, which is 8.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int A = sc.nextInt();
		int B = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(Math.min(A, B) + " " + Math.max(0, A + B - N));
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
