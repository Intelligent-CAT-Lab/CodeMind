The code takes the input as a string and stores it in variable s.
Then it iterates through the string s and checks if it contains "LR".
If it does, it stores the substring of s from the first index of "LR" to the last index of "RL" in variable firstRLBlock.
It then removes the substring of s from the first index of "LR" to the last index of "RL" and stores the remaining string in variable s.
It repeats the above process until the string s is empty.

Then it iterates through the string s and checks if it contains "R".
If it does, it stores the substring of s from the first index of "R" to the last index of "L" in variable rlBlock.
It then removes the substring of s from the first index of "R" to the last index of "L" and stores the remaining string in variable s.
It repeats the above process until the string s is empty.

Then it iterates through the string rlBlock and checks if it contains "R".
If it does, it stores the substring of rlBlock from the first index of "R" to the last index of "L" in variable rlBlock.
It then removes the substring of rlBlock from the first index of "R" to the last index of "L" and stores the remaining string in variable rlBlock.
It repeats the above process until the string rlBlock is empty.

Then it iterates through the string rlBlock and checks if it contains "L".
If it does, it stores the substring of rlBlock from the first index of "L" to the last index of "R" in variable rlBlock.
It then removes the substring of rlBlock from the first index of "L" to the last index of "R" and stores the remaining string in variable rlBlock.
It repeats the above process until the string rlBlock is empty.
