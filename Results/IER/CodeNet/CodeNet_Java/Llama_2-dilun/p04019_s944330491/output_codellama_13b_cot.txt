The input is "SENW".
The first character is 'S', which is true for the first condition.
The second character is 'E', which is true for the second condition.
The third character is 'N', which is true for the third condition.
The fourth character is 'W', which is true for the fourth condition.
Since the first and the third condition are true, the output is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		BufferedReader f = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);
		
		String line = f.readLine();
		boolean[] dir = new boolean[4];
		for(int i = 0; i < line.length(); i++) {
			char now = line.charAt(i);
			if(now == 'N') dir[0] = true;
			if(now == 'S') dir[1] = true;
			if(now == 'E') dir[2] = true;
			if(now == 'W') dir[3] = true;
		}
		if(dir[0] == dir[1] && dir[2] == dir[3]) System.out.println("Yes");

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```NESW
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
