The variable s is initialized with the input string "5 8".
The variable str is initialized with the string array of s.
The variable a is initialized with the BigInteger of str[0].
The variable b is initialized with the BigInteger of str[1].
The variable c is initialized with the BigInteger of a.subtract(b).
The output of the code is the value of variable c, which is 7.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
