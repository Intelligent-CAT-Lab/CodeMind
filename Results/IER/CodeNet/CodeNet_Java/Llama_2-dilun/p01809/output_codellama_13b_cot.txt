The variable p and q are initialized with 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable qs by dividing q by the value of variable buf, which is 1.
Then it iterates from 2 to Math.sqrt(qs) to check each integer i in this range.
If the value of variable qs is divisible by i, it calculates the value of variable qs by dividing it by i.
It also calculates the value of variable ans by multiplying it by i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		ArrayList<Long> yaku = new ArrayList<Long>();

		Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
		long p = scn.nextLong(), q = scn.nextLong();
		scn.close();
		long qs;
		long ans = 1;
		long bp = p,bq = q,buf = p;

		while(bq % bp!= 0) {
			buf = bq % bp;
			bq = bp;
			bp = buf;
		}
		qs = q/buf;
		for(long i = 2;i <= Math.sqrt(qs);i++) {
			if(qs % i ==0) {
				while(qs % i == 0) {
					qs /=i;
				}
				ans *= i;
			}
		}
		ans*= qs;
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
