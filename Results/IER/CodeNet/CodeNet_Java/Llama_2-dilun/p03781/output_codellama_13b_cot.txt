The variable x is initialized with 6 according to the input.
The for loop iterates from 1 to 6.
The condition of the for loop is i * (i + 1) / 2 < x.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
The value of variable i is 5.
The value of variable i is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scan.nextInt(), i = 1;
        for (; i * (i + 1) / 2 < x; i++) {}
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
