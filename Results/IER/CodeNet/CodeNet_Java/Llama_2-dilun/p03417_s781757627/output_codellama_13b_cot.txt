The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the absolute value of (n-2)*(m-2) and prints the result as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long n = sc.nextLong();
        long m = sc.nextLong();
        long ans =(Math.abs((n-2)*(m-2)));
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
