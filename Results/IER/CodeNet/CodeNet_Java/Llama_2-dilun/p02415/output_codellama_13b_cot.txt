The input is split into a string array by the split method.
The length of the string array is stored in variable num.
Then it iterates from 0 to num-1 to process each character in the string array.
If the character is lowercase, it is converted to uppercase and printed.
If the character is uppercase, it is converted to lowercase and printed.
If the character is a space, it is printed as a space.
If the character is any other character, it is printed as it is.

    Consider the following code:

//8-B
import java.util.Scanner;

        String n = sc.nextLine();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
