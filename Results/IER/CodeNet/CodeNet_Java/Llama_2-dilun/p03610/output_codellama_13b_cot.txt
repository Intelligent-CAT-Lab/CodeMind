The variable s is initialized with the input string "atcoder".
It splits the input string into an array of strings by using the split method of String class.
It iterates through the array of strings and prints the even-indexed elements of the array.
The output is "atcoder".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        String[] array = s.split("");

        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 2){
            System.out.print(array[i]);
        }
        
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```atcoder
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
