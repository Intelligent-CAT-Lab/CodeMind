The variable x and variable y are initialized with 2 and 16 respectively according to the input.
Then it calls the function solution(x,y) to calculate the output.
The function solution(x,y) first checks if the sum of x and y is even. If it is, it prints the value of (x+y)/2 as output. Otherwise, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" as output.
The sum of x and y is even, so the function prints the value of (x+y)/2 as output, which is 14.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void solution(int x, int y) {
		if((x+y)%2==0) {
			System.out.println((x+y)/2);
		}
		else {
			System.out.println("IMPOSSIBLE");
		}
	}
		
	
	public static void main(String args []) {
		Scanner obj = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x = obj.nextInt();
		int y = obj.nextInt();
		solution(x,y);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 16
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
