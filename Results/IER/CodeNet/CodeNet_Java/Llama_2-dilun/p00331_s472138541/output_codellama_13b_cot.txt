The variable a and variable b are initialized with -3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
Then it checks if the value of variable a + b is greater than 0. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable a + b is less than 0. If it is, it prints -1 as output.
Otherwise, it prints 0 as output.

        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scan.nextInt();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
