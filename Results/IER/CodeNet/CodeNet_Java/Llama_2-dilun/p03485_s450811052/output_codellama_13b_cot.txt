The variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the ceiling of (a + b) / 2.0, which is 2.
It prints the result 2 as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();

		System.out.println((int) Math.ceil((a + b) / 2.0));
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
