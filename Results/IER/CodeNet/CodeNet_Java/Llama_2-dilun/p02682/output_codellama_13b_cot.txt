The variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 2, 1, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if statement and it checks if d is less than or equal to a. If it is, it prints the value of d and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes the variable sum with a and subtracts d from it.
It enters another if statement and it checks if d is less than or equal to b. If it is, it prints the value of sum and returns.
Otherwise, it subtracts b from d and subtracts the result from sum.
It prints the value of sum.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = scan.nextInt();
    int b = scan.nextInt();
    int c = scan.nextInt();
    int d = scan.nextInt();
    int sum = 0;
    if (d<=a){
      System.out.println(d);
      return;
    }
    sum = a;
    d -= a;
    if(d<=b){
      System.out.println(sum);
      return;
    }
    d-=b;
    sum -= d;
    System.out.println(sum);
  }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1 1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
