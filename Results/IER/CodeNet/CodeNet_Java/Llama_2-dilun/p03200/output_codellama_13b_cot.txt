The variable count is initialized with 0.
The variable s is initialized with the input string "BBW".
The variable i is initialized with 0.
The variable black is initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates from 0 to the length of the input string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the input string is 'W'. If it is, it adds the value of variable black to variable count.
Otherwise, it increments the value of variable black.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable count as output, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long count =0;
		String s = sc.next();

		int i=0;
		int black=0;
		for (;i<s.length();i++) {
			if (s.charAt(i)=='W') {
				count +=black;
			} else {
				black++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```BBWBBW
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
