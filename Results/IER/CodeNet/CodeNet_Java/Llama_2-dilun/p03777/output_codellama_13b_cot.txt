The input is "H H".
The first line of code is executed.
The variable a is initialized with "H" and the variable b is initialized with "H".
The if statement is executed.
The condition is met and the code inside the if statement is executed.
The output is "H".
The code execution finishes.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    String a = sc.next();
    String b = sc.next();
    if(a.equals(b)){
      System.out.println("H");
    }else{
      System.out.println("D");
    }
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```H H
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
