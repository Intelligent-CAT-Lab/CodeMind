The variable N and variable K are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from K+1 to N to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying the value of i with the value of N/i.
Then it checks if the value of N%i is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to K. If it does, it adds the value of K == 0? N%i : N%i-K+1 to ans.
The condition is met when i is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of ans as output, which is 120.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int N = sc.nextInt();
    int K = sc.nextInt();
    
    long ans = 0;
    for (int i = K+1; i <= N; i++) {
      ans += (long)(i-K)*(N/i);
      if (N%i!= 0 && N%i >= K) {
        ans += K == 0? N%i : N%i-K+1;
      }
    }
    System.out.println(ans);
  }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
