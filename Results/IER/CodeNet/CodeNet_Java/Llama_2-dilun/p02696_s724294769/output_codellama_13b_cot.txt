The variable a, variable b and variable n are initialized with 5, 7 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable x is initialized with Math.min(b-1,n), which is 3.
The variable up is initialized with a*(x%b)-(a%b)*(x%b)%b, which is 14.
The variable up is divided by b, which is 7.
The output is 14/7, which is 2.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
