The input is 0 0 0 1.
The first line of code calculates the distance between the two points (0, 0) and (0, 1).
The second line of code calculates the distance between the two points (0, 0) and (1, 0).
The third line of code calculates the distance between the two points (0, 0) and (0, 1).
The fourth line of code calculates the distance between the two points (0, 0) and (1, 0).
The output is 0 0 0 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x1 = scan.nextInt();
		int y1 = scan.nextInt();
		int x2 = scan.nextInt();
		int y2 = scan.nextInt();
		scan.close();
		//int l = (int)Math.sqrt((x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2));
		int v1x = x2 - x1;
		int v1y = y2 - y1;
		int x4 = -v1y + x1;
		int y4 = v1x + y1;
		int v2x = x1 - x4;
		int v2y = y1 - y4;
		int x3 = -v2y + x4;
		int y3 = v2x + y4;

		System.out.println(x3 + " " + y3 + " " + x4 + " " + y4);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0 0 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
