The input is "abca".

The first step is to initialize the array frequency with 0.

The second step is to iterate through the input and increment the frequency of each character.

The third step is to create a priority queue and add all the pairs of node and frequency to the queue.

The fourth step is to create a map and add all the characters and their corresponding nodes to the map.

The fifth step is to iterate through the queue and remove the pairs with the highest frequency.

The sixth step is to create a new node with a dot as its character and add it to the map.

The seventh step is to iterate through the queue and add the pairs to the new node.

The eighth step is to iterate through the map and calculate the depth of each node.

The ninth step is to iterate through the map and calculate the frequency of each node.

The tenth step is to calculate the sum of the frequency of each node multiplied by its depth.

The eleventh step is to print the sum of the frequency of each node multiplied by its depth.

The twelfth step is to close the scanner.

The output is 10.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The first step is to initialize the array dp with 0.

The second step is to iterate through the input and initialize the array arr with the values.

The third step is to iterate through the array arr and calculate the maximum value of the previous row and the current row.

The fourth step is to print the maximum value of the previous row and the current row.

The fifth step is to close the scanner.

The output is 3 3
