The variable K is initialized with 2 and variable X is initialized with 900.
It checks if the value of variable X is less than or equal to 500*K.
Since 900 is less than 500*2, the condition is met and it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
 
class Main {
 
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int N = stdIn.nextInt();
		int M = stdIn.nextInt();
		int K = stdIn.nextInt();
		
		int[] arr = new int[N];
		
		for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			arr[i] = stdIn.nextInt();
		}
		
		int[][] dp = new int[M][K+1];
		
		for(int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
			for(int j = 0; j <= K; j++) {
				dp[i][j] = 0;
			}
		}
		
		for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			for(int j = 0; j <= K; j++) {
				if(j == 0) {
					dp[i][j] = arr[i];
				}else {
					dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1];
				}
			}
		}
		
		for(int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
			for(int j = 0; j <= K; j++) {

			System.out.println();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
