The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 3, 1 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable x is greater than or equal to variable a. If it is, it calculates the value of variable figure by subtracting variable x from variable a and then dividing the result by variable a minus variable b.
It then calculates the value of variable count by adding the value of variable x modulo 1000000007 to the value of variable figure modulo 1000000007.
It prints the value of variable count modulo 1000000007 as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	long a = sc.nextLong();
	long b = sc.nextLong();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
