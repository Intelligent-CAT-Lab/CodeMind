The variable l is initialized with 2 and variable r is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable msb.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the bit position of variable i in the binary representation of variable r.
Then it checks if the bit position of variable i is 0 or 1. If it is 0, it checks if the bit position of variable i in the binary representation of variable l is 0 or 1. If it is 0, it checks if the bit position of variable i in the binary representation of variable r is 0 or 1.
If the bit position of variable i in the binary representation of variable l is 0, it checks if the bit position of variable i in the binary representation of variable r is 0. If it is 0, it adds 1 to variable dp[i][0][0][0].
If the bit position of variable i in the binary representation of variable l is 1, it checks if the bit position of variable i in the binary representation of variable r is 1. If it is 1, it adds 1 to variable dp[i][1][0][0].
If the bit position of variable i in the binary representation of variable r is 0, it checks if the bit position of variable i in the binary representation of variable r is 1. If it is 1, it adds 1 to variable dp[i][0][1][0].
If the bit position of variable i in the binary representation of variable r is 1, it checks if the bit position of variable i in the binary representation of variable r is 1. If it is 1, it adds 1 to variable dp[i][1][1][0].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp[3][0][0][0] as output, which is 1.
