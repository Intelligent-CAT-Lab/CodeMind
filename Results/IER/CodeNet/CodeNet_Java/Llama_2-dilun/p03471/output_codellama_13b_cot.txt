The variable X and variable Y are initialized with 9 and 45000 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable b.
Inside the inner for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i with variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to variable Y. If it does, it sets variable judge to true and sets variable a, variable b and variable c to the values of i, k and X-i-k respectively.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable a, variable b and variable c as output, which is 9 4 5.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int X = sc.nextInt();
		int Y = sc.nextInt();

		int sum=0;
		boolean judge=false;
		int a=0;
		int b=0;
		int c=0;

		for (int i=0; i<X+1; i++) {
			for (int k=0; k<X-i+1; k++) {
				sum = 10000*i + 5000*k + 1000*(X-i-k);
				if (sum==Y) {
					judge = true;
					a=i;
					b=k;
					c=X-i-k;
					break;
				}
			}
		}
		if (judge) {
			System.out.print(a);
			System.out.print(" ");
			System.out.print(b);
			System.out.print(" ");
			System.out.print(c);

		} else {
			System.out.println("-1 -1 -1");
		}

	}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9 45000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
