The input is a string.
The first condition is that the length of the input is greater than or equal to 6.
The second condition is that the input contains at least one lowercase letter.
The third condition is that the input contains at least one uppercase letter.
The fourth condition is that the input contains at least one number.

The first condition is true because the length of the input is 8.
The second condition is true because the input contains the letter 'a'.
The third condition is true because the input contains the letter 'A'.
The fourth condition is true because the input contains the number '0'.

Therefore, the flag is true.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.ListIterator;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		String input = sc.next();
		
		boolean flag = input.length() >= 6 && input.matches(".*[a-z]+.*") && input.matches(".*[A-Z]+.*") && input.matches(".*[0-9]+.*");
		
		System.out.println(flag? "VALID" : "INVALID");
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```password
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
