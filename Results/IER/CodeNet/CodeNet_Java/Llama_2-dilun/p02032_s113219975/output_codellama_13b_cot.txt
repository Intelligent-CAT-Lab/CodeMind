The variable n is initialized with 18.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to Math.sqrt(18) to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable nums.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of n. If it is, it adds -i and -n / i to variable nums.
After the loop finishes, it print the size of variable nums, which is 2.

It enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to Math.sqrt(-x) to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of -x. If it is, it adds i and -x / i to variable used.
After the loop finishes, it print the size of variable used, which is 2.

It enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to Math.sqrt(-x) to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
