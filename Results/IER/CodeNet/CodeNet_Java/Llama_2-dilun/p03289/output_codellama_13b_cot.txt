The variable S is initialized with the input string "AtCoder".
The variable c is initialized with the character array of S.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
The variable index is initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates from 2 to the length of c - 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is equal to 'C'.
If it is, it increments the variable count by 1.
It also sets the variable index to the current index i.

The if statement checks if the variable count is equal to 1.
If it is, it prints "WA" and returns.

The for loop iterates from 0 to the length of c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current index i is equal to 0 or index.
If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it checks if the current character c[i] is between 'A' and 'Z'.
If it is, it prints "WA" and returns.

The if statement checks if the variable count is equal to 1.
If it is, it prints "AC" and closes the scanner.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String S = sc.next();
		char[] c = S.toCharArray();
		if (c[0]!= 'A') {

		int count = 0;
		int index = 0;
		for (int i = 2; i < c.length - 1; i++) {
			if (c[i] == 'C') {
				count++;
				index = i;
			}
		}
		if (count!= 1) {
			System.out.println("WA");
			return;
		}

		for (int i = 0; i < c.length; i++) {

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```AtCoder
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
