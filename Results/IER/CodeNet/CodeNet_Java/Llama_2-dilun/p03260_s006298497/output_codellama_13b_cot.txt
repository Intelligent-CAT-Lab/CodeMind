The variable A and variable B are initialized with 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable A is 2 and the value of variable B is 2. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int A = sc.nextInt();
		int B = sc.nextInt();
		sc.close();
 
		if (A!= 2 && B!= 2) {
			System.out.println("Yes");
		} else {
			System.out.println("No");
		}
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
