The variable r is initialized with 1199 according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable r is less than 1200. If it is, it assigns the value of variable s to "ABC".
Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable r is less than 2800. If it is, it assigns the value of variable s to "ARC".
Otherwise, it assigns the value of variable s to "AGC".
After the code finishes, it prints the value of variable s as output, which is "AGC".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int r = sc.nextInt();
    String s = "";
    if(r<1200){
      s="ABC";
    }else if(r<2800){
      s="ARC";
    }else{
      s="AGC";
    }
    System.out.println(s);
  }
  

  
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1200
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
