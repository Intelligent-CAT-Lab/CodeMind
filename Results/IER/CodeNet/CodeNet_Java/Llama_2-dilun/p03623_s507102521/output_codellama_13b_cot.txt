The variable x, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 7 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the absolute value of x-a and x-b.
It prints the character 'B' if the absolute value of x-a is greater than the absolute value of x-b. Otherwise, it prints the character 'A'.
<<<Output>>>
A

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int x = sc.nextInt(), a = sc.nextInt(), b = sc.nextInt();
		
		System.out.println(Math.abs(x-a) > Math.abs(x-b)? 'B' : 'A');
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
