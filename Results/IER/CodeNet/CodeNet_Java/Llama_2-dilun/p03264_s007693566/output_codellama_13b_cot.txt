The variable k is initialized with 3.
It checks if k is even or odd. If it is even, it prints the square of k/2. If it is odd, it prints the square of (k/2+1).
The output is 9.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		if(k%2==0) {
			System.out.println((k/2)*(k/2));
		}else {
			System.out.println((k/2+1)*(k/2));
		}
		sc.close();
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
