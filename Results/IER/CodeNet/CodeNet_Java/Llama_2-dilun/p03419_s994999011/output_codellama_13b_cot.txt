The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable bin by subtracting 2 from n and then converting it to a BigInteger.
It calculates the value of variable bim by subtracting 2 from m and then converting it to a BigInteger.
It calculates the value of variable ret by multiplying the values of variable bin and variable bim and then taking the absolute value of the result.
It prints the value of variable ret as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Main m = new Main();
		m.run();
	}

	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	void run() {
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();
		
		BigInteger bin = BigInteger.valueOf(n-2);		
		BigInteger bim = BigInteger.valueOf(m-2);		
		
		BigInteger ret = bin.multiply(bim).abs();
		
		
		System.out.println(ret.toString());
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
