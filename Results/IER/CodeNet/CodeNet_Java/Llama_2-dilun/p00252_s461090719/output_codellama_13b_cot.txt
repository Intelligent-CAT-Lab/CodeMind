The variable b1, b2 and b3 are initialized with 0, 0 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of b1 is 1 and b2 is 0 and b3 is 0. If it is, it prints "Close".
Otherwise, it checks if the value of b1 is 0 and b2 is 1 and b3 is 0. If it is, it prints "Open".
<<<Output>>>
Open

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int b1 = scan.nextInt();
		int b2 = scan.nextInt();
		int b3 = scan.nextInt();
		if(b1 == 1 && b2 == 0 && b3 == 0 || b1 == 0 && b2 == 1 && b3 == 0 || b1 == 0 && b2 == 0 && b3 == 0){
			System.out.println("Close");
		} else {
			if(b1 == 1 && b2 == 1 && b3 == 0 || b1 == 0 && b2 == 0 && b3 == 1){
				System.out.println("Open");
			}
		}
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 0
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
