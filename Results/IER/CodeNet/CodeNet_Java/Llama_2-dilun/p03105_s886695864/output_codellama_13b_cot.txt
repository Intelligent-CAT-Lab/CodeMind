The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 11 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the condition b >= a is met.
Inside the while loop, it increments the variable count by 1.
Then it subtracts the variable a from the variable b.
It checks if the variable count is greater than or equal to the variable c. If it is, it breaks out of the while loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the variable count as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		int count = 0;

		while (b >= a) {
			count++;
			b -= a;
			if (count >= c) {
				break;
			}
		}
		System.out.print(count);

	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 11 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
