The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It prints the output of the code, which is "NO".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println((n >= k * 2 - 1)? "YES" : "NO");
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
