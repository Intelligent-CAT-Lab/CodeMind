The variable k is initialized with 0.
It reads the input and stores it in the array arr.
It sorts the array arr.
It calculates the step by comparing the difference between the first and second element and the difference between the second and third element.
If the difference between the first and second element is greater than 3, it iterates the first element by 2 until the difference between the first and second element is less than 3.
If the difference between the second and third element is greater than 3, it iterates the second element by 2 until the difference between the second and third element is less than 3.
It calculates the step by comparing the difference between the first and third element and the difference between the second and third element.
It creates a tuple3 object with the first, second and third element of the array arr.
It stores the step in the tuple3 object.
It adds the tuple3 object to the deque que.
It iterates the deque que until it is empty.
It checks if the tuple3 object is equal to the first element of the array arr.
If it is, it prints the step.
