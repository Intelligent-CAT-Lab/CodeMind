The second line of code is to check if a equals c. If it does, it prints the value of b and returns.
The third line of code is to check if b equals d. If it does, it prints the value of a and returns.
The fourth line of code is to calculate the greatest common divisor of Math.abs(a - c) and Math.abs(b - d).
The fifth line of code is to print the value of Math.abs(a - c) + Math.abs(b - d) - x.

The output is 1.
