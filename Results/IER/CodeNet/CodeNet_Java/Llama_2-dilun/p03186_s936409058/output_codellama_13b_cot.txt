The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 3, 1 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the sum of a, b and 1, which is 5.
It calculates the minimum of 5 and c, which is 4.
It adds b to 4, which is 5.
It prints 5 as output.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long a = sc.nextLong();
		long b = sc.nextLong();
		long c = sc.nextLong();
		System.out.println(b + Math.min(a + b + 1, c));
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
