The input is "erasedream".
The first step is to replace "eraser" with "".
The second step is to replace "erase" with "".
The third step is to replace "dreamer" with "".
The fourth step is to replace "dream" with "".
The final string is "".
The length of the final string is 0.
The output is "YES".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = sc.next();
        String replaced = S.replace("eraser", "").replace("erase", "").replace("dreamer", "").replace("dream", "");
        if(replaced.length() == 0) System.out.println("YES");
        else System.out.println("NO");
    }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```erasedream
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
