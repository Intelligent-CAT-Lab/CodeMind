The variable N is initialized with 2.
The variable a is initialized with 0.

It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the gcd of the current interger i and variable a by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable a.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable a as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Scanner sn = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sn.nextInt();
        int result = 0;
        int a = 0;

        for(int i=1; i<=N; i++){
            for(int j=1; j<=N; j++){
                a =gcd(i, j);
                for(int k=1; k<=N; k++){
                    result += gcd(a, k);
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(result);

    public static int gcd(int p, int q){
        if(p % q == 0){
            return q;

        return gcd(q, p%q);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
