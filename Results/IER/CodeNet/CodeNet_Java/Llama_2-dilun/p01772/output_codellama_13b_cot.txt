The variable c is initialized with 65.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 65 to 90 to check each integer c in this range. The value of variable c is also passed to variable c.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current interger c is a space character. If it is, it reads the next character.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable c as output, which is 90.
<<<Output>>>
90

<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] a = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			a[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			System.out.println(a[i]);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 2```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable a is initialized with a new int array with length 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it reads the next integer from the input and stores it in variable a[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable a as output, which is [1, 2, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3]
