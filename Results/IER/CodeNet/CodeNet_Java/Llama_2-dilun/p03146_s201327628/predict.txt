The variable n is initialized with 8.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the condition n % 2 == 0 is met.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of n / 2.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of n is 1. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
Otherwise, it enters another while loop and it iterates until the condition n == 3 * n + 1 is met.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of n = 3 * n + 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of n is 1. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of n is 2. If it is, it prints 2 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of n is 3. If it is, it prints 3 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of n is 4. If it is, it prints 4 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of n is 5. If it is, it prints 5 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of n is 6. If it is, it prints 6 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of n is 7. If it is, it prints 7 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of n is 8. If it is, it prints 8 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of n is 9. If it is, it prints 9 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of n is 10. If it is, it prints 10 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of n is 11. If it is, it prints 11 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of n is 12. If it is, it prints 12 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of n is 13. If it is, it prints 13 as output.
