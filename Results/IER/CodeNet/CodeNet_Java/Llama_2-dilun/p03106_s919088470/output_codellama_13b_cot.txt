The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized with 8, 12 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 8 to 12 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable max.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable count by checking if the current interger i is a factor of both a and b.
It checks if the value of variable count is equal to k. If it is, it sets the value of variable result to i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String args[]) {

        // 入力
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int b = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int k = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        sc.close();

        // 主処理
        int result = 0;
        int count = 0;
        int max = Math.min(a, b);
        for (int i = max; 0 < i; i--) {
            if (a % i == 0 && b % i == 0) {
                count++;
                if (count == k) {
                    result = i;
                }
            }
        }

        // 出力
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 12 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
