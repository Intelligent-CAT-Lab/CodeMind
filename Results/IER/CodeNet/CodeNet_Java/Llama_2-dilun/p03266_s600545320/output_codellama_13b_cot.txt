The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable count is initialized with 0.

The condition is met when k is even. In this case, the variable x is initialized with n / k.
The variable y is initialized with (n + k / 2) / k.
The variable count is initialized with (x * x * x) + (y * y * y).

The condition is met when k is odd. In this case, the variable x is initialized with n / k.
The variable count is initialized with (x * x * x).

After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 12.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		long count = 0;
		if (k % 2 == 0) {
			long x = n / k;
			count += (x * x * x);
			long y = (n + k / 2) / k;
			count += (y * y * y);
		} else {
			long x = n / k;
			count += (x * x * x);
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
