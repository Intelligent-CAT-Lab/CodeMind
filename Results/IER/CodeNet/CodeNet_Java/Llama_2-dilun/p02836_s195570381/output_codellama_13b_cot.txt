The variable s is initialized with the input string.
Then it calls the function fun(s) to calculate the number of pairs of characters that are not equal in the input string.
The function fun(s) iterates from 0 to len/2 to check each pair of characters in the input string.
If the characters in the pair are not equal, it increments the variable res.
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of variable res as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
    String s=sc.next();
    System.out.println(fun(s));
  }
  public static int fun(String s){
    int len=s.length(),res=0;
    for(int i=0;i<len/2;i++){
      if(s.charAt(i)!=s.charAt(len-1-i)) res++;
    }
    return res;
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```redcoder
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
