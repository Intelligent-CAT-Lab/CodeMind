The variable N and variable M are initialized with 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
Then it prints the output of the code, which is 12.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
