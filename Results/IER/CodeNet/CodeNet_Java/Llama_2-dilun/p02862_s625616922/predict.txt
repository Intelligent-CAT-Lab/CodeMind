The variable x and variable y are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if statement to check if the sum of x and y is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable n by dividing the sum of x and y by 3.
It then subtracts the value of variable n from variable x and variable y.
It then calls the function modCombination to calculate the value of variable top and variable bottom.
It then calculates the value of variable bottom by multiplying it with the value of variable i and then dividing it by mod.
It then calculates the value of variable top by multiplying it with the value of variable n and then dividing it by mod.
It then calculates the value of variable bottom by multiplying it with the value of variable i and then dividing it by mod.
It then calculates the value of variable top by multiplying it with the value of variable bottom and then dividing it by mod.
