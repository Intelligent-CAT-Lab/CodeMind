The input is 5 5 7.
The first step is to initialize the array arr with the values of the input.
The second step is to sort the array arr.
The third step is to check if the array arr is sorted in ascending order.
The condition is met when arr[0] == 5  && arr[1] == 5 && arr[2] == 7.
If the condition is met, the output is YES.
If the condition is not met, the output is NO.
<<<Output>>>
YES

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in); 
		
		int SideA = keyboard.nextInt();
		int SideB = keyboard.nextInt();
		int SideC = keyboard.nextInt();
		
		int[] arr = new int[] {SideA, SideB, SideC};
		Arrays.sort(arr);
		
		if (arr[0] == 5  && arr[1] == 5 && arr[2] == 7) {
				System.out.println("YES");					
			}else {
			System.out.println("NO");
		}	
		keyboard.close();	
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 5 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
