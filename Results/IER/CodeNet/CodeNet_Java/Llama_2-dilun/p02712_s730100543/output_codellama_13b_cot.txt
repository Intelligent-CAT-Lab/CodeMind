The variable N is initialized with 15.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 to check each integer i in this range.
It checks if the current integer i is divisible by 3 and 5. If it is, it adds i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 23.
<<<Output>>>
23

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;


public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int N = sc.nextInt();
		long sum = 0;

		for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {

			if(i % 3!= 0 && i % 5!= 0) {
				sum = sum + i;
			}
		}

		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```15
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
