The variable N is initialized with 432.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 432 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable i multiplied by 1.08 is equal to 432. If it does, it prints the value of variable i and returns.
The condition is met when i is 432.
After the loop finishes, it prints ":(".
<<<Output>>>
432

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		for (int i=0;i<=N;i++) {
			if ((int)(i*1.08)==N) {
				System.out.println(i);
				return ;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(":(");
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```432
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
