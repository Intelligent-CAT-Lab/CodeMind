The variable a and variable b are initialized with 5 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It prints "Yay!" if the condition a<9&&b<9 is met. Otherwise, it prints ":("

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
            while (sc.hasNextInt()) {
                int a = sc.nextInt();
                int b = sc.nextInt();
                System.out.println((a<9&&b<9)?"Yay!":":(");
            }
        }
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
