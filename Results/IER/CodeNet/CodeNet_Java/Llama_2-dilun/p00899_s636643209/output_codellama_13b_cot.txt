The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tail.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the length of the string s[tail] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[i] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] + s[i] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] - s[i] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] + s[i] + s[tail] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] + s[i] - s[tail] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] - s[i] - s[tail] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] + s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] + s[i] - s[tail] - s[i] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] - s[i] - s[tail] - s[i] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] + s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] + s[i] - s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] - s[i] - s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] + s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] + s[i] - s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] - s[i] - s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] + s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] + s[i] - s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail] - s[i] - s[tail] - s[i] + s[tail] - s[i] by using the method same_length.
It then calculates the length of the string s[tail]
