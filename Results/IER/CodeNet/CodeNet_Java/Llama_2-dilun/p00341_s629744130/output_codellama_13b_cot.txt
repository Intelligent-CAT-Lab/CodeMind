<<<Analysis>>>
The variable e is initialized with 12 according to the input. And variable t is initialized with 12 elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11 to fill the elements of variable t with the input.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 10 to check each element of variable t.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 10 - x to check each element of variable t.
It checks if the current element of variable t is less than the next element of variable t. If it is, it swaps the two elements.
It checks if the first element of variable t is equal to the second element of variable t, the second element of variable t is equal to the third element of variable t, the third element of variable t is equal to the fourth element of variable t, the fifth element of variable t is equal to the sixth element of variable t, the sixth element of variable t is equal to the seventh element of variable t, the eighth element of variable t is equal to the ninth element of variable t, the ninth element of variable t is equal to the tenth element of variable t and the tenth element of variable t is equal to the eleventh element of variable t.
If it is, it prints "yes". Otherwise, it prints "no".
<<<Output>>>
no
