The variable n, variable x and variable t are initialized with 20, 12 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until n is greater than tako.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the sum of variable t and variable x and adds it to variable ans.
Then it increments variable tako by variable x.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output, which is 126.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n, x, t;
        n = sc.nextInt();
        x = sc.nextInt();
        t = sc.nextInt();
        long ans = 0, tako = 0;
        while (n > tako) {
            ans += t;
            tako += x;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
        sc.close();
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 12 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
