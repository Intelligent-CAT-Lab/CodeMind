<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string of 10 digits.
The code first converts the string to a char array.
Then it calculates the length of the string.
Then it initializes a variable p with 2019.

The code calculates the number of 2019's multiples in the string by iterating from the last digit to the first digit.
It calculates the remainder of the current digit divided by 2019.
If the remainder is 0, it means the current digit is a multiple of 2019.
It adds the current digit to the answer.

The code calculates the remainder of the current digit divided by 2019.
