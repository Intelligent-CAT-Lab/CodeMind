The variable c1, c5, c10, c50, c100 and c500 are initialized with 3, 1, 4, 0, 4 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the sum of the variables c1, c5, c10, c50, c100 and c500 by multiplying each variable with its corresponding coefficient and adding them together.
It checks if the calculated sum is greater than or equal to 1000. If it is, it prints 1 as output. Otherwise, it prints 0 as output.

Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int c1 = scan.nextInt();
        int c5 = scan.nextInt();
        int c10 = scan.nextInt();
        int c50 = scan.nextInt();
        int c100 = scan.nextInt();
        int c500 = scan.nextInt();
        if ((c1 * 1 + c5 * 5 + c10 * 10 + c50 * 50 + c100 * 100 + c500 * 500) >= 1000) {

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 4 0 4 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
