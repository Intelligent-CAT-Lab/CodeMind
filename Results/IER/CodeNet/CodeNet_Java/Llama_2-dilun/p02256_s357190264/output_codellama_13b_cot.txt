The variable x and y are initialized with 54 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It enters the method gcd() and it calculates the gcd of x and y by repeatedly calling the method gcd() until y is 0.
The gcd of 54 and 20 is 4.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x = in.nextInt();
		int y = in.nextInt();
		
		Main program = new Main();
		System.out.println(program.gcd(x, y));
	}
	
	public int gcd(int x, int y) {
		if(y == 0) {
			return x;
		}
		return gcd(y, x%y);
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```54 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
