The variable x, y and z are initialized with 5, 14 and 80 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 5 to 14 to check each integer i in this range.
It calculates the remainder of variable z divided by variable i and checks if it is equal to 0.
If it is, it increments the value of variable t.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable t as output, which is 4.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	    int x = sc.nextInt();
	    int y = sc.nextInt();
	    int z = sc.nextInt();
	    int t = 0;
	    for (int i = x; i <= y; i++) {
	    	if (z % i == 0)
	    		t++;
	    } System.out.println(t);
     }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 14 80
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
