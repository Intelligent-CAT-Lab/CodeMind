The variable n is initialized with 0.
It calculates the value of ans1 by dividing n by 30.
It calculates the value of ans2 by multiplying n by 2.
It prints the value of ans1 and ans2 as output.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String ar[]){
        Scanner cin=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=cin.nextInt();
        int ans1=n/30;
        n%=30;
        int ans2=n*2;
        System.out.println(ans1+" "+ans2);
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
