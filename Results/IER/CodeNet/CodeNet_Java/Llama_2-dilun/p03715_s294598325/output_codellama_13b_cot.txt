The variable H and variable W are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of H is divisible by 3 or the value of W is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of h1 and h2 by dividing H by 2 and 3 respectively.
It calculates the value of w1 and w2 by dividing W by 2 and 3 respectively.
It calculates the value of a1 by dividing W by 3. If the value of a1 is 0, it adds 1 to it.
It calculates the value of a2 and a3 by multiplying the value of a1 by H and W respectively.
It calculates the value of cur by taking the maximum value of a2 and a3 and the minimum value of a1*H and a1*W.
It calculates the value of a1 by dividing H by 3. If the value of a1 is 0, it adds 1 to it.
It calculates the value of a2 and a3 by multiplying the value of a1 by W and H respectively.
It calculates the value of cur by taking the minimum value of a2 and a3 and the maximum value of a1*W and a1*H.
It calculates the value of cur by taking the minimum value of H and W.
It prints the value of cur as output.
