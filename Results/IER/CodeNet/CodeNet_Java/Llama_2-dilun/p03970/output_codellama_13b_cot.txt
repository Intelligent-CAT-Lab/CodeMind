The variable S is initialized with the input string.
The variable correct is initialized with the string "CODEFESTIVAL2016".
The variable num is initialized with 0.

It iterates from 0 to 15 to check each character in the string S.
If the character at the current index i is different from the corresponding character in the string correct, it increments the variable num by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable num as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner input  = new Scanner(System.in);
		String S = input.nextLine();
		input.close();
		String correct = "CODEFESTIVAL2016";
		int num = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i < 16;i++){
			if(S.charAt(i)!= correct.charAt(i)) num++;
		}
		System.out.println(num);
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```C0DEFESTIVAL2O16
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
