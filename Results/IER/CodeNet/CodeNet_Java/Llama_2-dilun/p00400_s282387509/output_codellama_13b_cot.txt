The variable n is initialized with 67.
It checks if the value of variable n falls within the range [a, z] or [A, Z].
If it does, it prints 2 as output.
If it does not, it prints 1 as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int ans = 0;

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```67
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
