<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the difference between variable b and variable a, which is 2.
It checks if the difference is even or odd. If it is even, it prints "Alice". Otherwise, it prints "Borys".
<<<Output>>>
Borys

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
		Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = scn.nextInt();
		int a = scn.nextInt();
      	int b = scn.nextInt();
      	if((b-a)%2==0) System.out.println("Alice");
      	else System.out.println("Borys");
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
