The variable dress is initialized with 3 and variable days is initialized with 5.
It calculates the quotient of days and dress by dividing days by dress.
It prints the quotient as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int dress = sc.nextInt();
		int days = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println((days + dress - 1) / dress);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
