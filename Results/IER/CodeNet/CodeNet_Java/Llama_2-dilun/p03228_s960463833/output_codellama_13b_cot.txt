The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized with 5, 4 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2, which is the number of times the loop is executed.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable i is even or odd. If it is even, it decreases the value of variable a by 1. If it is odd, it increases the value of variable b by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable a and variable b as output, which is 1 3.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
