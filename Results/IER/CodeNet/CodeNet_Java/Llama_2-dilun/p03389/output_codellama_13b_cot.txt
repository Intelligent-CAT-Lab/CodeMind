The variable A, B and C are initialized with 2, 5 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the maximum value of A, B and C by using the Math.max() method.
It calculates the remainder of (A+B+C)%2 and M%2.
If the remainder of (A+B+C)%2 is equal to the remainder of M%2, it prints the output (3*M-(A+B+C))/2.
Otherwise, it prints the output ((3*M+3)-(A+B+C))/2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int A = sc.nextInt();
		int B = sc.nextInt();
		int C = sc.nextInt();
		int M = Math.max(A, Math.max(B, C));

		if((A+B+C)%2 == M%2) {
			System.out.println((3*M-(A+B+C))/2);
		}else {
			System.out.println(((3*M+3)-(A+B+C))/2);
		}

	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
