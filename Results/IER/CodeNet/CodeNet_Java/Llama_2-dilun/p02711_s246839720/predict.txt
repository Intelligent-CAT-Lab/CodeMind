The variable hayami saori is initialized with a new hayami object.
It calls the nextHayami() method of hayami saori to get the next hayami string.
It splits the hayami string with a space and then checks if the first three characters are 7.
If it is, it prints "Yes" and closes the hayami saori object.
Otherwise, it prints "No" and closes the hayami saori object.
