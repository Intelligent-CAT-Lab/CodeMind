The variable x and variable y are initialized with 3 and 8 respectively according to the input.
Then it calculates the value of variable crane by subtracting the value of variable y/2 from 2*x.
Then it calculates the value of variable turtle by subtracting the value of variable crane from x.
Then it checks if the value of variable turtle is less than 0 or the value of variable crane is less than 0 or the value of variable turtle is not an integer or the value of variable crane is not an integer.
If it is true, it prints "No" as output.
If it is false, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.Integer; 

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    double x = sc.nextInt(); // 頭数
    double y = sc.nextInt(); // 足の数
    double crane = -(y/2) + 2*x;
    double turtle = x - crane;
    if(turtle < 0 || crane < 0 || turtle % 1!= 0 || crane % 1!= 0 ){
      System.out.println("No");
    }else{
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
