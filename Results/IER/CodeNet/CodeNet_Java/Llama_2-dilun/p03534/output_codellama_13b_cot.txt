The variable abc is initialized with 0, 0 and 0 respectively.
It iterates through the string str and checks if the current character is equal to the character at the same index in the string "abc". If it is, it increments the corresponding element of variable abc.
After the loop finishes, it sorts the array abc.
Then it checks if the difference between the second and first element of array abc is less than 2 and the difference between the third and first element of array abc is less than 2.
If it is, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
NO

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public void main(Scanner sc) {
        String str = sc.next();
        int abc[] = new int[3];
        for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (str.charAt(i) == "abc".charAt(j)) {
                    abc[j]++;
                }
            }
        }

        Arrays.sort(abc);

        System.out.println(((abc[1] - abc[0] < 2) && (abc[2] - abc[0] < 2))? "YES" : "NO");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abac
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
