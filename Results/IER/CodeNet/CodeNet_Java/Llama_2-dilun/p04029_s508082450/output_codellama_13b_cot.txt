The variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scan.nextInt();
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        System.out.println(sum);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
