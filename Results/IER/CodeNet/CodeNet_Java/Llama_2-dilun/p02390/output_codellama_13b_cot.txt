The variable S is initialized with 46979.
It calculates the value of variable h by dividing S by 3600.
It calculates the value of variable hi by moduloing S by 3600.
It calculates the value of variable m by dividing hi by 60.
It calculates the value of variable s by moduloing hi by 60.
It prints the value of variable h, variable m and variable s as output.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```46979
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
