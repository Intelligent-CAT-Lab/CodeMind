The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 6, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable c is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [3, 2]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4,5 and 6.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 16.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
	    System.out.println(n - a - b + c);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 3 2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
