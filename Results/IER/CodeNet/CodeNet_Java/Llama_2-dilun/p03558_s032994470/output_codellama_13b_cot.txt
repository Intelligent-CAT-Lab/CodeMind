The variable k is initialized with 6 according to the input.
It creates a Vertex array with 6 elements.
It initializes the first element of the array with a Vertex object with value 0.
It initializes the second element of the array with a Vertex object with value 1.
It initializes the third element of the array with a Vertex object with value 2.
It initializes the fourth element of the array with a Vertex object with value 3.
It initializes the fifth element of the array with a Vertex object with value 4.
It initializes the sixth element of the array with a Vertex object with value 5.
It sets the edge of the first element with the second element with cost 0.
It sets the edge of the second element with the third element with cost 1.
It sets the edge of the third element with the fourth element with cost 2.
It sets the edge of the fourth element with the fifth element with cost 3.
It sets the edge of the fifth element with the sixth element with cost 4.
It sets the edge of the sixth element with the first element with cost 5.
It calls the dijkstra method with start vertex 1 and goal vertex 0.
It returns the value 10.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
