The variable a, b and c are initialized with 4, 3 and 90 respectively according to the input.
The first line of output is 0.5 * 4 * 3 * Math.sin(Math.toRadians(90)).
The second line of output is a + b + Math.sqrt(a*a+b*b - (2 * (a * b * Math.cos(Math.toRadians(90))))).
The third line of output is b * Math.sin(Math.toRadians(90)).

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.math.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        double a, b, c;
        a = sc.nextDouble();
        b = sc.nextDouble();
        c = sc.nextDouble();
        System.out.println(0.5 * a * b * Math.sin(Math.toRadians(c)));
        System.out.println(a + b + Math.sqrt(a*a+b*b - (2 * (a * b * Math.cos(Math.toRadians(c))))));
        System.out.println(b * Math.sin(Math.toRadians(c)));
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 3 90
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
