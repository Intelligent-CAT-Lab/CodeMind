The variable n is initialized with 6.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [1, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 15.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
    	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    	int n = sc.nextInt();
        int num[] = {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 14, 1, 5, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 15, 2, 2, 5, 4, 1, 4, 1, 51};
        System.out.println(num[n - 1]);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
