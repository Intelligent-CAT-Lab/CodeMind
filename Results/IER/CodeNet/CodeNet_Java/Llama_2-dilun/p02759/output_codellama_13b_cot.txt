The variable N is initialized with 5.
It prints the value of (N + 1) / 2, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int N = sc.nextInt();
    System.out.printf("%d", (N + 1) / 2);
    sc.close();
    return;
  }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
