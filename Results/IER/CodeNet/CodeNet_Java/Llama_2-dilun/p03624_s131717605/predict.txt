The variable table is initialized with a HashSet.
The variable str is initialized with the input string.
The variable c is initialized with the character 'a'.
The variable i is initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates from 0 to str.length() to check each character in the input string.
The variable c is assigned with the character at the current index of the input string.
The variable table is checked if it contains the character c.
If it does, the for loop breaks and the program terminates.
If it does not, the variable c is assigned with the next character in the input string and the for loop iterates again.

After the for loop finishes, the variable c is assigned with the character 'z'.
The for loop iterates again.
The variable c is assigned with the character 'a'.
The variable i is assigned with 0.
