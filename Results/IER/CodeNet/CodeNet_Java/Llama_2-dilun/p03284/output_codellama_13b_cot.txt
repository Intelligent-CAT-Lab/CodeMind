The variable n and variable k are initialized with 7 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the remainder of n divided by k is 0. If it is, it prints 0 as output. Otherwise, it prints 1 as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt(),k=sc.nextInt();
        if(n%k == 0){
            System.out.println(0);
        }else{
            System.out.println(1);
        }
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
