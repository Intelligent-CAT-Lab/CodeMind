The variable A, B and C are initialized with rng, gorilla and apple respectively according to the input.
It checks if the last character of variable A is equal to the first character of variable B and the last character of variable B is equal to the first character of variable C.
If it is true, it prints YES as output. Otherwise, it prints NO as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner Input = new Scanner(System.in);
        String A = Input.next();
        String B = Input.next();
        String C = Input.next();
        if (A.charAt(A.length() - 1) == B.charAt(0) && B.charAt(B.length() - 1) == C.charAt(0)) {
            System.out.println("YES");
        } else {
            System.out.println("NO");}
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```rng gorilla apple
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
