The variable s is initialized with the input string "aabbaa".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to s.length()-1 to check each character in the string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is the last character of the string. If it is, it checks if the next character is the same as the current character. If it is, it increments the variable i and increments the variable ans.
If the current character is not the last character of the string, it checks if the next character is the same as the current character. If it is, it increments the variable i and increments the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String [] Args)
	{
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s=in.next();
		int ans=0;
		for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
		{
			if(i==s.length()-2) {
				if(s.charAt(i)==s.charAt(i+1)) {
					i++;
				}
			}else if(i!=s.length()-1){
				if(s.charAt(i)==s.charAt(i+1)) {
					i++;
					ans++;
					i++;
				}
			}
			ans++;
		}

		System.out.println(ans);
			
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```aabbaa
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
