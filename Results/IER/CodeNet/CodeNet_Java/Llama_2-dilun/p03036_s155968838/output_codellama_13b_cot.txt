The variable r is initialized with 2 and variable d is initialized with 10.
The variable ary is initialized with an array of 11 integers.
The first element of the array is initialized with 20.
The for loop iterates 10 times.
In each iteration, it multiplies the current element of the array with variable r and subtracts variable d from the result.
Then it prints the result.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int[] ary = new int [11];
		int r = sc.nextInt();
		int d = sc.nextInt();
		ary[0] = sc.nextInt();
		for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
			ary[i + 1] = ary[i] * r - d;
			System.out.println(ary[i + 1]);
		}
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 10 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
