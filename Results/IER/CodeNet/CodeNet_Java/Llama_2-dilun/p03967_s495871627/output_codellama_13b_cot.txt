The variable s is initialized with the input string "gpg".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the substring of s at index i is equal to "p". If it is, it increments the variable count.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the length of the string s divided by 2 minus the value of variable count.
The result is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0 ; i < s.length() ; i++) {
            if (s.substring(i, i + 1).equals("p")) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(s.length()/2 - count);

    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```gpg
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
