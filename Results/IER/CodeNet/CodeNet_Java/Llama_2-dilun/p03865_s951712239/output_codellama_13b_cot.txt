The variable S is initialized with the input string "aba".
The variable even is initialized with false because the length of the input string is odd.
The variable match is initialized with false because the first and last character of the input string are not the same.
The output is "Second".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    char[] S = sc.next().toCharArray();
    boolean even = S.length % 2 == 0;
    boolean match = S[0] == S[S.length - 1];
    System.out.println((even ^ match)? "Second" : "First");
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```aba
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
