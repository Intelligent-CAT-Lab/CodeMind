The variable s is initialized with the input string.
The variable A is initialized with the index of the first 'A' in the string.
The variable Z is initialized with 0.

It iterates through the string and checks if the current character is 'Z'. If it is, it updates the variable Z.

After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable Z - variable A + 1, which is 10.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.next();
		int A = s.indexOf("A");
		int Z = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
			if(s.charAt(i) == 'Z')
				Z = i;
		}
		System.out.println(Z - A + 1);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```QWERTYASDFZXCV
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
