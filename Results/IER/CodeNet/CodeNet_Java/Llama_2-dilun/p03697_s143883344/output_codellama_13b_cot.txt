The variable A and variable B are initialized with 6 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of A and B is greater than or equal to 10. If it is, it prints "error". Otherwise, it prints the sum of A and B.
<<<Output>>>
6

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int A = sc.nextInt();
		int B = sc.nextInt();
		
		if(A+B >= 10)
			System.out.println("error");
		else
			System.out.println(A+B);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
