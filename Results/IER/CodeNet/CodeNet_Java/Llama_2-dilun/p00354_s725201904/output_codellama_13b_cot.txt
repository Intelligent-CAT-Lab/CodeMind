The variable X is initialized with 1 according to the input.
Then it enters a switch statement and it checks the value of X modulo 7.
If the value of X modulo 7 is 4, it prints "mon" as output.
If the value of X modulo 7 is 5, it prints "tue" as output.
If the value of X modulo 7 is 6, it prints "wed" as output.
If the value of X modulo 7 is 0, it prints "thu" as output.
If the value of X modulo 7 is 1, it prints "fri" as output.
If the value of X modulo 7 is 2, it prints "sat" as output.
If the value of X modulo 7 is 3, it prints "sun" as output.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
