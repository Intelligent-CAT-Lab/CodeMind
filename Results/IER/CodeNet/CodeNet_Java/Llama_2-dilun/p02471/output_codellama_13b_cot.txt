The variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 12 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable b is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor of variable a and variable b by using the method gcd(a,b).
Then it calculates the quotient of variable a and variable b by dividing variable a by variable b.
It calculates the remainder of variable a and variable b by subtracting the quotient from variable a.
It updates the value of variable r1 with the value of variable a and the value of variable r2 with the value of variable b.
It updates the value of variable x1 with the value of variable x2 and the value of variable y1 with the value of variable y2.
It updates the value of variable x2 with the value of variable x3 and the value of variable y2 with the value of variable y3.
After the loop finishes, it print the value of variable x1 and variable y1 as output, which is 2 and 0.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
