The variable a is initialized with 3 + 8 = 11 and variable b is initialized with 7 + 1 = 8.
Then it prints the output based on the comparison of a and b.
If a is greater than b, it prints "Left".
If a is equal to b, it prints "Balanced".
If a is less than b, it prints "Right".
In this case, a is greater than b, so it prints "Left".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt() + sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt() + sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(a > b? "Left" : a == b? "Balanced" : "Right");
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8 7 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
