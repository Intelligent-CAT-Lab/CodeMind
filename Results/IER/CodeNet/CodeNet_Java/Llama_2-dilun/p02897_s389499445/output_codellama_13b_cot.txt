The variable N is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It prints the output of the code, which is 0.625.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {
	Scanner sc;

	Main() {
		sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	}
	
	void calc() {
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println((double)((N+1)/2)/N);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Main().calc();
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
