The variable s is initialized with the input string "5 8".
The variable str is initialized with the string array of s.
The variable a is initialized with the BigInteger object of the first element of the array str.
The variable b is initialized with the BigInteger object of the second element of the array str.
The variable c is initialized with the BigInteger object of the multiplication of a and b.
The output is printed as the value of variable c.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
