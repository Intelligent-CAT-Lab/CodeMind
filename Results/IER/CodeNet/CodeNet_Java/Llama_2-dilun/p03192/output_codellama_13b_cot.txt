The variable string is initialized with the input string "1222".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to string.length() to check each character in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is '2'. If it is, it increments the variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{



	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);			//文字の入力
		String string = sc.next();
		int count =0 ;
		for(int i = 0;i < string.length();i++){
			if(string.charAt(i) == '2'){
				count++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1222
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
