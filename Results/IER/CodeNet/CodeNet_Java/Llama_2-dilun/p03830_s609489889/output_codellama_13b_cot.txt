The input is 3.
The code first initializes the variable N with 3.
Then it initializes the variable memo with a 2D array of size 1000 x 10000.
It initializes the first element of the array with 1.

It then iterates from 2 to 1000 to calculate the number of prime numbers less than or equal to N.
It does this by iterating from 2 to N and checking if the current number is prime.
If it is prime, it increments the number of primes by 1.
