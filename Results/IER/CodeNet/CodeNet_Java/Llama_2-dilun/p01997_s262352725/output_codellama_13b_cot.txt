The variable A and variable B are initialized with 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of B * B * B * Math.PI / 3.0 * 4.0.
It prints the result of the calculation.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        while (sc.hasNextInt()) {
            int A = sc.nextInt();
            int B = sc.nextInt();

            System.out.printf("%.10f\n", B * B * B * Math.PI / 3.0 * 4.0);
        }
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
