The variable W, variable H, variable x and variable y are initialized with 2, 3, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the area of the rectangle with width W and height H as variable men.
It calculates the area of the rectangle with width x and height H as variable a.
It calculates the area of the rectangle with width W and height y as variable b.
It calculates the area of the rectangle with width x and height W as variable c.
It calculates the area of the rectangle with width W and height y as variable d.
It calculates the minimum value of variable a and variable b as variable xx.
It calculates the minimum value of variable c and variable d as variable yy.
It calculates the number of times variable xx is equal to variable men as variable hou.
It calculates the number of times variable yy is equal to variable men as variable hou.
It checks if variable hou is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it sets variable hou to 0. Otherwise, it sets variable hou to 1.
It prints the value of variable men and variable hou as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in); 
		
		int n = keyboard.nextInt();
		int m = keyboard.nextInt();
		
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = keyboard.nextInt();
		}
		
		int sum = 0;
		
		for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
			int x = arr[i];
			int y = arr[i+1];
			
			if(x > y) {
				sum += x;
			}else {
				sum += y;
			}
		}
		
		System.out.println(sum);
		keyboard.close();	
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It initializes an array arr with 3 elements.
It iterates from 0 to 2 to initialize the elements of array arr with the values of the input.
It iterates from 0 to 1 to calculate the sum of the elements of array arr.
It prints the value of variable sum as output.
