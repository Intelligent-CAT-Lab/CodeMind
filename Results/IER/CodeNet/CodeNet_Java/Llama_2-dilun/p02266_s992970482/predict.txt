The input is ```\\//```
The first character is ```\```, which is a backslash. It is a special character that is used to escape the following character.
The second character is ```//```, which is a slash. It is a special character that is used to indicate a comment.
The third character is ```\```, which is a backslash. It is a special character that is used to escape the following character.
The fourth character is ```//```, which is a slash. It is a special character that is used to indicate a comment.

The code starts by initializing a variable rand with the input string.
It then creates a Stack object called down and initializes it with an empty Stack.
It then creates a Deque object called s and initializes it with an empty Deque.
It then creates a variable sum and initializes it with 0.
It then iterates through the input string character by character.
For each character, it checks if the character is a backslash. If it is, it pushes the index of the current character into the Stack object down.
It then checks if the character is a slash. If it is, it checks if the Stack object down is not empty. If it is not empty, it pops the top element from the Stack object down and checks if the Deque object s is empty. If the Deque object s is empty, it adds a new Pool object to the Deque object s with the index of the current character as the j value and the sum of the j values of all the elements in the Deque object s as the s value.
It then adds the sum of the index of the current character and the index of the top element of the Stack object down to the variable sum.
It then checks if the Deque object s is not empty. If it is not empty, it iterates through the elements in the Deque object s and prints the j value and the s value of each element.
It then prints the value of the variable sum.
It then closes the Scanner object sc.

The output of the code is 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
