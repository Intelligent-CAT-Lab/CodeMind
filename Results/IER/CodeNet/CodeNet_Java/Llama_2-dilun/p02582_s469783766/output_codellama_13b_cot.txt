<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string.
The variable left is initialized with 0.
The variable max is initialized with 0.

It iterates through the input string and checks if the current character is 'R'. If it is, it calculates the maximum value of the variable max by adding the current index of the character to the value of variable left.
The variable left is initialized with the index of the current character.

After the loop finishes, it returns the value of variable max as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        Solver solverObj = new Solver();
        System.out.println(solverObj.solve(s));
    }
}

class Solver {
    public int solve(String s){
        int max = 0;

        int left = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
             char c = s.charAt(i);
             if(c == 'R'){
                 max = Math.max(max, i - left + 1);
             } else {
                 left = i + 1;
             }
        }
        return max;
    }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
