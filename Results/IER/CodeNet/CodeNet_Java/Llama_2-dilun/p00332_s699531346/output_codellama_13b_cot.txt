The variable E is initialized with 0 and variable Y is initialized with 2015.
The if statement checks if E is 0. If it is, it checks if Y is less than or equal to 1911. If it is, it prints "M" and prints the difference between Y and 1867.
If Y is less than or equal to 1925, it prints "T" and prints the difference between Y and 1911.
If Y is less than or equal to 1988, it prints "S" and prints the difference between Y and 1925.
If Y is greater than 1988, it prints "H" and prints the difference between Y and 1988.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 2015
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
