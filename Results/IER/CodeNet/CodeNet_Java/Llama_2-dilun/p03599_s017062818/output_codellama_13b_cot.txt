The variable A, B, C, D, E and F are initialized with 1, 2, 10, 20, 15 and 200 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 to check each integer a in this range. The value of variable a is also passed to variable A.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 to check each integer b in this range. The value of variable b is also passed to variable B.
Inside the inner for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 to check each integer c in this range. The value of variable c is also passed to variable C.
Inside the inner for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 to check each integer d in this range. The value of variable d is also passed to variable D.
Inside the inner for loop, it calculates the value of variable buf by dividing the value of variable C*c+D*d by the value of variable (100 * (A*a+B*b) + C*c+D*d).
It checks if the value of variable buf is greater than the value of variable ans. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to the value of variable buf.
It also sets the value of variable water to the value of variable (A*a+B*b)*100 and the value of variable sugar to the value of variable C*c+D*d.
It checks if the value of variable sugar is greater than the value of variable water. If it is, it prints the value of variable water and the value of variable sugar.
If it is not, it prints the value of variable water and the value of variable sugar.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
