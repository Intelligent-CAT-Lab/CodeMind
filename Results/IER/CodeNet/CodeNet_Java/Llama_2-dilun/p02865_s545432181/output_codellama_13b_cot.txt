The variable a is initialized with 4.
It checks if the value of variable a is even or odd. If it is even, it calculates the value of variable ans by dividing a by 2 and then subtracting 1 from it.
If it is odd, it calculates the value of variable ans by dividing a by 2.
Then it prints the value of variable ans as output.
<<<Output>>>

<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[]args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		int d = sc.nextInt();
		int ans = 0;
		if(a == b && b == c && c == d) {
			ans = 1;

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable a is equal to the value of variable b, the value of variable b is equal to the value of variable c and the value of variable c is equal to the value of variable d.
If it is true, it sets the value of variable ans to 1.
Otherwise, it sets the value of variable ans to 0.
Then it prints the value of variable ans as output.
