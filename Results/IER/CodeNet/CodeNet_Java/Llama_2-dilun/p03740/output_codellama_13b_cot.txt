The variable sc is initialized with a Scanner object.
It prints the output of the code, which is "Brown".
<<<Output>>>
Brown
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[INST]
    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
		try{
			Scanner sc  = new Scanner(System.in);
			System.out.println(Math.abs(sc.nextLong() - sc.nextLong()) <= 1? "Brown" : "Alice");
		}catch(Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
