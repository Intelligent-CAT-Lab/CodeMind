The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each character c in this range.
The variable step is initialized with 0.
The variable sb is initialized with a StringBuilder object.
It appends the character c to the StringBuilder object.
If the character c is 'A', it sets the variable step to 1.
If the variable step is 1 and the character c is 'B', it sets the variable step to 2.
If the variable step is 2 and the character c is 'C', it sets the variable step to 0.
It sets the length of the StringBuilder object to the length of the StringBuilder object minus 3.
It appends the character 'X' to the StringBuilder object.
It sets the variable ns to the StringBuilder object.
It checks if the variable ns contains the character 'X'.
If it does, it checks if the variable ns contains the character 'BX' or the character 'XB'.
If it does, it returns false.
It checks if the variable ns contains the character 'B'.
If it does, it sets the variable r to the variable ns with the character 'X' replaced with the character 'B'.
It checks if the variable r contains the character 'BX' or the character 'XB'.
If it does, it returns true.
It checks if the variable ns contains the character 'A'.
If it does, it sets the variable r to the variable ns with the character 'X' replaced with the character 'A'.
It checks if the variable r contains the character 'AX' or the character 'XA'.
If it does, it returns true.
It checks if the variable ns contains the character 'C'.
If it does, it sets the variable r to the variable ns with the character 'X' replaced with the character 'C'.
It checks if the variable r contains the character 'XC' or the character 'CX'.
If it does, it returns true.
It checks if the variable ns contains the character 'A' or the character 'C'.
If it does, it returns true.
It checks if the variable ns contains the character 'X' or the character 'C'.
If it does, it returns true.
It returns false.
