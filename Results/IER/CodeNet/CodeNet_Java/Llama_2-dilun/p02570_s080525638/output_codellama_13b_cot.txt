The variable d, variable t and variable s are initialized with 1000, 15 and 80 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the product of variable s and variable t, which is 1200.
Then it checks if the product is less than variable d. Since 1200 is less than 1000, the condition is met and it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int d = sc.nextInt();
    int t = sc.nextInt();
    int s = sc.nextInt();
    sc.close();
    if( (s * t) < d){
      System.out.println("No");
    } else {
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }
  }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000 15 80
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
