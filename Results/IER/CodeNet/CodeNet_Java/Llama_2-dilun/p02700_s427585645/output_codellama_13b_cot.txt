The variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 10, 9, 10 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the quotient of variable c and variable b, which is 1.
It calculates the quotient of variable a and variable d, which is 1.
It checks if the remainder of variable c and variable b is 0, which is false.
It checks if the remainder of variable a and variable d is 0, which is false.
It prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int d = sc.nextInt();
        int cntT = c / b;
        if(c % b!= 0) cntT++;
        int cntA = a / d;
        if(a % d!= 0) cntA++;
        System.out.println( cntT <= cntA? "Yes" : "No");
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 9 10 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
