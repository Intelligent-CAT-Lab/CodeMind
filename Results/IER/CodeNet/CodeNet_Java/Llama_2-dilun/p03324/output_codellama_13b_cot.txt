The variable D is initialized with 0 and variable A is initialized with 10000.
The variable N is initialized with 5.
The variable ser is initialized with 0 and variable count is initialized with 0.
The while loop iterates until ser reaches N.
Inside the while loop, the variable count is incremented by 1.
If the condition search(count*A,D) is true, the variable ser is incremented by 1.
After the while loop finishes, the variable ser is printed as output, which is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    Long D = sc.nextLong();
    Long A = (D==2)?10000L:(D==1)?100L:1L;
    Long N = sc.nextLong();
    Long ser = 0L;
    Long count = 0L;
    while(ser < N){
      count += 1L;
      if(search(count*A,D)){
        ser += 1L;
      }
      
    }
    System.out.println(count*A);
    sc.close();
  }
  public static boolean search(Long a,Long b){
    Long o = (a%1000000 == 0)?3L:(a%(10000)==0)?2L:(a%100==0)?1L:0L;
    if (b == o){

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
