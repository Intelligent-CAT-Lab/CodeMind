The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input.
It prints the value of s[0]==s[n-1]&&s[0]=='x'? 'x' : 'o' as output.
The value of s[0] is 'x' and the value of s[n-1] is 'x' as well.
So the condition is met and the output is 'x'.
<<<Output>>>
x

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

//Simple Othello
public class Main{

	void run(){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		char[] s = sc.next().toCharArray();
		int n = s.length;
		System.out.println(s[0]==s[n-1]&&s[0]=='x'?'x':'o');
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Main().run();
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```oxxoxoo
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
