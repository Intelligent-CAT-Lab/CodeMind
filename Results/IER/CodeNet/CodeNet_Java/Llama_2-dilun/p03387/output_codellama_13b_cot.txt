The variable x is initialized with 2, 5 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It sorts the array x.
It calculates the value of variable temp by multiplying 2 with the last element of array x, subtracting the second element of array x and the first element of array x.
It calculates the value of variable ans by adding 1 to the value of variable temp if the remainder of variable temp divided by 2 is 1. Otherwise, it divides the value of variable temp by 2.
It prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 10.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import static java.lang.System.*;
import static java.lang.Math.*;
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args){
Scanner sc = new Scanner(in);
int[] x=new int[3];
x[0]=sc.nextInt();
x[1]=sc.nextInt();
x[2]=sc.nextInt();
Arrays.sort(x);
int temp=2*x[2]-x[1]-x[0];
int ans;
if(temp%2==1){ans=(temp+2)/2+1;}else{ans=temp/2;}
out.println(ans);
}}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
