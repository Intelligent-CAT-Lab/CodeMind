The variable n and variable k are initialized with 7 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the remainder of n divided by k, which is 1.
Then it prints 1 as the output.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args){
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int n=Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
int k=Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
//String s=sc.next();
//int[] a=new int[n];
//for(int i=0;i<n;i++){}
int ans;
if(n%k==0){ans=0;}else{ans=1;}
System.out.println(ans);
}}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
