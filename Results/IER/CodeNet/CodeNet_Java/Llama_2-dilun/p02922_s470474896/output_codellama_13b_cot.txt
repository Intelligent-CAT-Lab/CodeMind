The variable X and Y are initialized with 4 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
The condition of the while loop is that the value of variable i is less than the value of variable Y.
The value of variable i is also passed to variable X.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable i by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable i as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int X = sc.nextInt();
        int Y = sc.nextInt();

        int i = 0;
        while(((X-1)*i +1 )<Y){
            i++;
        }
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
