The input is 1 2 +. The first string is 1 2. The second string is +.
The first string is split by space and the first element is 1 and the second element is 2.
The first element is pushed into the stack.
The second string is +.
The stack is popped and the first element is 1.
The second element is popped and the first element is 2.
The first element is added to the second element and the result is 3.
The result is pushed into the stack.
The stack is popped and the first element is 3.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 +
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
