The variable S is initialized with 1905.
It calculates the value of variable yy by dividing S by 100.
It calculates the value of variable mm by modulo operation of S and 100.

It checks if the value of variable yy is between 1 and 12. If it is, it checks if the value of variable mm is between 1 and 12. If it is, it prints "AMBIGUOUS".
If the value of variable yy is not between 1 and 12, it checks if the value of variable mm is between 1 and 12. If it is, it prints "YYMM".
If the value of variable yy is not between 1 and 12 and the value of variable mm is not between 1 and 12, it prints "NA".

The value of variable yy is 19 and the value of variable mm is 5.
The condition is met when yy is 19 and mm is 5.
So it prints "AMBIGUOUS".
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>


import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int S = sc.nextInt();
		int yy = S / 100;
		int mm = S % 100;

		if(1 <= yy && yy <= 12) {
			if(1 <= mm && mm <= 12) {
				System.out.println("AMBIGUOUS");
			}else {
				System.out.println("MMYY");
			}
		}else {
			if(1 <= mm && mm <= 12) {
				System.out.println("YYMM");
			}else {
				System.out.println("NA");
			}
		}

	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1905
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
