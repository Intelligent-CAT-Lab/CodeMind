The variable j and variable y are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a dfs() function and passes the values of variable j and variable y to the function.
The dfs() function starts by checking if the value of variable j is 0. If it is, it checks if the value of variable y is 0. If it is, it checks if the string ans is ok. If it is, it prints the string ans.
If the value of variable j is not 0, it calls the dfs() function again with the value of variable j decreased by 1 and the value of variable y unchanged.
If the value of variable y is not 0, it calls the dfs() function again with the value of variable j unchanged and the value of variable y decreased by 1.
