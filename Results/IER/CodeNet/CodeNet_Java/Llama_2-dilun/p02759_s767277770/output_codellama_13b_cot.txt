The variable N is initialized with 5.
It checks if N is even or odd. If it is even, it prints the value of N/2. If it is odd, it prints the value of N/2 + 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		if(N%2 == 0) {
			System.out.println(N/2);
		} else {
			System.out.println(N/2 + 1);
		}

	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
