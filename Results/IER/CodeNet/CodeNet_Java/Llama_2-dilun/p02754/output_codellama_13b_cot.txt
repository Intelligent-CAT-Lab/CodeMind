The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 8, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 8 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [3, 4]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 3,4,5,6,7,8.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 28.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
