The variable x is initialized with 1000.
It checks if the value of variable x is less than 1200. If it is, it prints "ABC" as output. Otherwise, it prints "ARC" as output.
<<<Output>>>
ABC

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x = sc.nextInt();
		if(x<1200) {
			System.out.println("ABC");
		}else {
			System.out.println("ARC");
		}
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
