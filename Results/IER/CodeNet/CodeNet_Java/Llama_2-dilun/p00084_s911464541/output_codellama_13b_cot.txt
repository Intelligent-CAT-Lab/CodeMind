The input is split into a string array by the split method.
The string array is iterated and each string is checked if it is between 2 and 7 characters long.
If it is, it is appended to the StringBuilder object.
The StringBuilder object is then converted to a string and printed.
<<<Output>>>
Rain, rain, go to Spain.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
    	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    	String[] arr = sc.nextLine().split( "[,. ]" );
    	StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    	for(String s : arr)
    		if(2 < s.length() && s.length() < 7)
    			sb.append(s+" ");
    	System.out.println(sb.toString().trim());
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```Rain, rain, go to Spain.
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
