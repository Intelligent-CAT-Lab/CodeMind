The variable x is initialized with 3 and variable y is initialized with 20.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the condition x>y is met.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of x by multiplying it by 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the value of variable count, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
	public static void main(String[] $) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long x=sc.nextLong(),y=sc.nextLong(),count=1;
		while(true) {
			x*=2;
			if(x>y)break;
			count++;
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
