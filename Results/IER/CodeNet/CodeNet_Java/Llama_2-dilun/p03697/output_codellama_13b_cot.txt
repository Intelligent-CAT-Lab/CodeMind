The variable a and variable b are initialized with 6 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to 10. If it is, it prints "error" as output.
Otherwise, it prints the sum of a and b as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		if (a + b >= 10) {
    		System.out.println("error"); 
		}
		else {
		    System.out.println(a + b);
		}
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
