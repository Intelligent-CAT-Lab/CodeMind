The variable X is initialized with 3 and variable Y is initialized with 20.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until X is greater than Y.
Inside the loop, it increments the value of variable i by 1.
Then it calculates the value of X by multiplying it by 2.
It checks if the value of X is greater than Y. If it is, it exits the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the value of variable i as output, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        Long X = sc.nextLong();
        Long Y = sc.nextLong();

        int i=0;
        while(X<=Y){
            i++;
            X*=2;
        }

        System.out.println(i);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
