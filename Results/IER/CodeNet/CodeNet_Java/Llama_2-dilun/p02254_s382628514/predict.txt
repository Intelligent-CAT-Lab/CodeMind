The variable alphabets[] is initialized with 26 zeros.
It iterates through the input string and increments the corresponding element in alphabets[] according to the input.
It creates a priority queue pq with the elements in alphabets[] as the keys.
It iterates through the priority queue and removes the first two elements.
