The variable y1, variable m1 and variable d1 are initialized with 2015, 3 and 13 respectively according to the input. And variable y1s, variable y1a and variable c1 are initialized with 0, 0 and 0 respectively.
The variable y2, variable m2 and variable d2 are initialized with 2015, 3 and 13 respectively according to the input. And variable y2s, variable y2a and variable c2 are initialized with 0, 0 and 0 respectively.

It calculates the value of variable y1s by dividing variable y1 by 400 and then it calculates the value of variable y1a by extracting the remainder of variable y1 by 400.
It calculates the value of variable c1 by calling the function get13f(y1a, m1, d1) and it calculates the value of variable c2 by calling the function get13f(y2a, m2, d2).
It calculates the value of variable y2s by dividing variable y2 by 400 and then it calculates the value of variable y2a by extracting the remainder of variable y2 by 400.

It calculates the value of variable c2 - c1 by subtracting the value of variable c2 from the value of variable c1.
It calculates the value of variable y2s - y1s by subtracting the value of variable y2s from the value of variable y1s.

It prints the value of variable c2 - c1 - (y2s - y1s) as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
