The code first reads the input and stores it in a string s.
Then it initializes a boolean array poss with poss[0] = true.
It iterates through the string s and checks if the current character is a valid character for the string.
If it is, it checks if the current character is the first character of the string.
If it is, it sets poss[s.length()] = true.
If it is not, it checks if the current character is the last character of the string.
If it is, it sets poss[s.length()] = true.
If it is not, it checks if the current character is the first character of the string.
If it is, it sets poss[s.length()] = true.
If it is not, it checks if the current character is the last character of the string.
If it is, it sets poss[s.length()] = true.
