The variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable a is less than or equal to 9 and the value of variable b is less than or equal to 9.
If the condition is met, it prints the product of variable a and variable b as output.
If the condition is not met, it prints -1 as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        if (a <= 9 && b <= 9)
            System.out.println(a*b);
        else
            System.out.println(-1);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
