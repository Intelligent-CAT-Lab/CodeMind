The variable s is initialized with the input string "1222".
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character c in the string s.
It checks if the current character c is equal to '2'. If it is, it increments the variable rs by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable rs as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = "" + in.nextInt();

        int rs = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '2') rs++;
        }

        System.out.println(rs);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1222
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
