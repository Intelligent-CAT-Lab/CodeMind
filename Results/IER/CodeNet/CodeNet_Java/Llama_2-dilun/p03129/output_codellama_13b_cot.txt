The variable sc is initialized with a Scanner object.
It reads the first input, which is 3.
It reads the second input, which is 2.
It calculates the sum of the first input and 1, which is 4.
It calculates the quotient of the sum and the second input, which is 2.
It checks if the quotient is greater than or equal to the second input, which is true.
It prints "YES" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        if((sc.nextInt() + 1) / 2 >= sc.nextInt()) System.out.println("YES");
        else System.out.println("NO");
    }

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
