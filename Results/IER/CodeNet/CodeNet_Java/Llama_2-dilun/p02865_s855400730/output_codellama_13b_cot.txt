The variable N is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It prints the value of (N-1)/2, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        System.out.println((N-1)/2);
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
