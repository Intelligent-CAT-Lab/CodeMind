The variable n is initialized with 117.
It prints the string representation of variable n, which is "117".
It checks if the string contains the character "7".
Since the string contains the character "7", it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = s.nextInt();
        String string = String.valueOf(n);
        System.out.println(string.contains("7")? "Yes" : "No");
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```117
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
