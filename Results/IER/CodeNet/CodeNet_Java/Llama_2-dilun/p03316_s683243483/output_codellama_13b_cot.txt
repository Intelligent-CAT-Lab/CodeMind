The variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input.
It calculates the length of the string strn, which is 2.
It calculates the sum of the digits of the string strn, which is 3.
It checks if the remainder of n divided by the sum is 0, which is false.
It prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n;

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        n = sc.nextInt();

        String strn = String.valueOf(n);
        int len = strn.length();

        String ans;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            sum += Integer.parseInt(strn.substring(i, i + 1));
        }
        if (n % sum == 0) ans = "Yes";

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```123456789

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
