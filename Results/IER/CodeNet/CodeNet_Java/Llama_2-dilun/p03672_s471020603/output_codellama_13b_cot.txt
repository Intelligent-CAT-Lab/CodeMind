The variable s is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from s.length()-2 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the substring of s from 0 to i/2 is equal to the substring of s from i/2 to i. If it does, it prints the value of i and breaks the loop. The condition is met when i is 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable i, which is 20.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.next();
		for(int i=s.length()-2; i>=1; i-=2){
			if(s.substring(0, i/2).equals(s.substring(i/2,i))){
				System.out.println(i);
				break;
			}
		}
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abaababaab
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
