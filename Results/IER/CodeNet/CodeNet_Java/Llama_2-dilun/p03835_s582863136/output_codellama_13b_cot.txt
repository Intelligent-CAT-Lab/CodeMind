The variable k is initialized with 2 and variable s is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer x in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer y in this range.
Then it checks if the condition 0<=s-x-y&&s-x-y<=k is met. If it does, it increments the variable count.
The condition is met when x=0, y=0, x=1, y=1, x=1, y=0, x=0, y=1 and x=0, y=0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 6.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();
		int count=0;
		for(int i=0; i<=n; i++) {
			for(int j=0; j<=m; j++) {
				if(0<=i-j&&i-j<=n) {
					count++;
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
