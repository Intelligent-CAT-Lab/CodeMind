The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the absolute value of n-m is greater than 1. If it is, it prints 0 and returns.
Otherwise, it calculates the answer by repeatedly calling the function solve(n,m) and adding the result to the answer.
The function solve(n,m) calculates the answer by repeatedly calling the function solve(max,x) and multiplying the result by x.
The function solve(max,x) calculates the answer by repeatedly calling the function solve(max,x) and multiplying the result by x.
