The variable N and variable M are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
Then it calculates the absolute value of (N-2) * (M-2) and prints it as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        final long N = sc.nextLong();
        final long M = sc.nextLong();

        System.out.println(Math.abs((N-2) * (M-2)));
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
