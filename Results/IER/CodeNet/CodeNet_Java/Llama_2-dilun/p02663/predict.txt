The variable h1, m1, h2 and m2 are initialized with 10, 0, 15 and 0 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 30.
It calculates the difference between the hours and minutes of the two time points by subtracting the value of variable h2 from variable h1 and the value of variable m2 from variable m1.
Then it calculates the difference between the hours and minutes of the two time points by subtracting the value of variable h2 from variable h1 and the value of variable m2 from variable m1.
