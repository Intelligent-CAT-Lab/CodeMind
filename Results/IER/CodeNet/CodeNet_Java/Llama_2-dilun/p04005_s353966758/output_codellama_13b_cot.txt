The variable A, B and C are initialized with 3, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It sorts the array arr with the values of A, B and C.
It checks if all the values of A, B and C are odd. If it is, it calculates the product of A and B, and then calculates the product of A and C, and then calculates the product of B and C. It then prints the minimum of the three products.
The minimum of the three products is 3 * 3 * 3 = 27.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args ){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    long A = sc.nextLong();
    long B = sc.nextLong();
    long C = sc.nextLong();

    long [] arr = new long[]{ A,B,C };
    Arrays.sort(arr);

    long result = 0 ;
    if (A % 2 == 1 && B % 2 == 1 && C % 2 == 1 ) {
      result = arr[0] * arr[1];
      // result = Math.min(A * B, Math.min(A * C, B * C));
    }
    System.out.println(result);
  }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
