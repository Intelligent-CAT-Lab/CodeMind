The variable a, b and c are initialized with 10, 30 and 20 respectively according to the input.
Then it calculates the sum of a, b and c, which is 60.
Then it calculates the discriminant of the triangle with sides a, b and c, which is 0.
Then it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int c = sc.nextInt();
    int sum = a + b + c;
    int discr = (2 * a - sum) * (2 * b - sum) * (2 * c - sum);
    if (discr == 0) {
      System.out.println("Yes");
    } else {
      System.out.println("No");
    }
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 30 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
