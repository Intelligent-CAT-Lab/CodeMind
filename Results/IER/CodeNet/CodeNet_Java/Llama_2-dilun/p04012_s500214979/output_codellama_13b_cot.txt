The variable w is initialized with the input string "abaccaba".
The variable c is initialized with a character array of length w.length().
The variable a is initialized with an integer array of length 1000.
The variable flag is initialized with true.

The for loop iterates from 0 to w.length() and extracts the character at index i from the input string w.
It then stores the character at index i in the variable c[i].

The for loop iterates from 0 to 1000 and increments the value of variable a[i] by 1.

The for loop iterates from 0 to 1000 and checks if the value of variable a[i] is odd.
If it is odd, it sets the value of variable flag to false and breaks the loop.

If the value of variable flag is true, it prints "Yes" as output.
If the value of variable flag is false, it prints "No" as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		String w = scan.next();
		char[] c = new char[w.length()];
		for (int i = 0; i < w.length(); i++) {
			c[i] = w.charAt(i);
		}
		int[] a = new int[1000];
		for (int i = 0; i < w.length(); i++) {
			a[c[i]]++;
		}
		boolean flag = true;
		for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
			if (a[i]%2==1) {
				flag = false;
				break;
			}
		}
		if (flag) {
			System.out.println("Yes");			
		}
		else {
			System.out.println("No");
		}
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abaccaba
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
