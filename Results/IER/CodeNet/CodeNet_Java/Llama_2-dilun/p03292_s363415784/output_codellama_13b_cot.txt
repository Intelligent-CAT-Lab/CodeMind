The variable data is initialized with 3 elements. The first element is initialized with 1, the second element is initialized with 6 and the third element is initialized with 3.
Then the variable sum is initialized with 0.
The variable sum is calculated by the following steps:
1. The absolute value of the difference between the first element and the second element is calculated.
2. The absolute value of the difference between the second element and the third element is calculated.
3. The sum of the two absolute values is calculated.

The final value of variable sum is 11.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[]args){
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

      int[] data = new int[3];
      int sum = 0;
      for(int i =0;i<3;i++){
        data[i] = sc.nextInt();
      }

      Arrays.sort(data);

      sum = Math.abs(data[1]-data[0]);
      sum = sum + Math.abs(data[1]-data[2]);

      System.out.println(sum);

      }

  }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
