The variable N and variable K are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer alpha in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable b by adding variable K and variable alpha.
Then it calculates the value of variable n by dividing the value of variable N by the value of variable b.
It adds the value of variable n to variable ans.
If the value of variable K+n*b is less than or equal to the value of variable N, it adds the value of variable ans to the value of variable ans.
If the value of variable K+n*b is greater than the value of variable N, it subtracts the value of variable N from the value of variable ans.
If the value of variable K is 0, it subtracts the value of variable N from the value of variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scan.nextInt();
        int K = scan.nextInt();
        long ans = 0;
        for(int alpha = 1; K+alpha<=N;++alpha){
            int b = K+alpha;
            int n = (N-K)/b;
            ans += n*alpha;
            if(K+n*b<=N)ans += Math.min(N, K+n*b+alpha-1) - (K+n*b)+1;
        }
        if(K==0)ans -=N;
        System.out.println(ans);
    }   
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
