The variable a is initialized with 2.
It prints the value of a + a * a + a * a * a, which is 2 + 4 + 8 = 14.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    System.out.println(a + a * a + a * a * a);
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
