The code is a simple program that calculates the number of ways to arrange n distinct objects in a row such that the first k objects are distinct.

The code first initializes the variable n with 2 and the variable k with 1.

Then it calculates the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row.

It calculates the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row by calculating the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct.

It calculates the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct by calculating the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct.

It calculates the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct by calculating the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct and the third object is distinct.

It calculates the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct and the third object is distinct by calculating the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct and the third object is distinct and the fourth object is distinct.

It calculates the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct and the third object is distinct and the fourth object is distinct by calculating the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct and the third object is distinct and the fourth object is distinct and the fifth object is distinct.

It calculates the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct and the third object is distinct and the fourth object is distinct and the fifth object is distinct by calculating the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct and the third object is distinct and the fourth object is distinct and the fifth object is distinct and the sixth object is distinct.

It calculates the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct and the third object is distinct and the fourth object is distinct and the fifth object is distinct and the sixth object is distinct by calculating the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct and the third object is distinct and the fourth object is distinct and the fifth object is distinct and the sixth object is distinct and the seventh object is distinct.

It calculates the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct and the third object is distinct and the fourth object is distinct and the fifth object is distinct and the sixth object is distinct and the seventh object is distinct by calculating the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct and the third object is distinct and the fourth object is distinct and the fifth object is distinct and the sixth object is distinct and the seventh object is distinct and the eighth object is distinct.

It calculates the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct and the third object is distinct and the fourth object is distinct and the fifth object is distinct and the sixth object is distinct and the seventh object is distinct and the eighth object is distinct by calculating the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct and the third object is distinct and the fourth object is distinct and the fifth object is distinct and the sixth object is distinct and the seventh object is distinct and the eighth object is distinct and the ninth object is distinct.

It calculates the number of ways to arrange the first k objects in a row such that the first object is distinct and the second object is distinct and the third object is distinct and the fourth object is distinct and the fifth object is distinct and the sixth object is distinct and the seventh object is distinct and the eighth object is distinct and the ninth object is distinct by calculating the number of ways
