The variable R, G and B are initialized with 1, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable N is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable R.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable r by subtracting the value of variable R from the value of variable N.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable G.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable r by subtracting the value of variable G from the value of variable r.
It checks if the value of variable r is divisible by the value of variable B. If it is, it increments the value of variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    int N = scanner.nextInt();
    int M = scanner.nextInt();

    int[] arr = new int[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      arr[i] = scanner.nextInt();
    }

    int[] dp = new int[M + 1];
    dp[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= M; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        if (arr[j] <= i) {
          dp[i] += dp[i - arr[j]];
        }
      }
    }
    System.out.println(dp[M]);
  }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N and variable M are initialized with 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable N.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the value of variable dp with 1.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable N.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable arr[j] is less than or equal to the value of variable i. If it is, it adds the value of variable dp[i - arr[j]] to the value of variable dp.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp as output, which is 2.
