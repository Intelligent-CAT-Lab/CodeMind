The code first initializes the variable n with the length of the input string.
Then it initializes the TreeMap<Double, Integer> sumIdx with the key-value pair of 0.0 and -1.
It iterates through the input string and calculates the sum of the input string.
It then checks if the sum is equal to 0.0. If it is, it returns the output.
Otherwise, it iterates through the TreeMap<Double, Integer> sumIdx and checks if the sum is equal to the key of the entry.
If it is, it returns the output.
Otherwise, it checks if the sum is greater than the key of the entry.
If it is, it returns the output.
Otherwise, it checks if the sum is less than the key of the entry.
If it is, it returns the output.
Otherwise, it returns the output "-1 -1".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scan.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = scan.nextInt();
        }
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
        System.out.println(sum);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 2```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized with 3.
The variable arr is initialized with 3 elements.
The first element is initialized with 1, the second element is initialized with 2 and the third element is initialized with 3.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It iterates through the array arr and adds the elements to the variable sum.
It prints the final value of the variable sum as output, which is 6.
