The variable n is initialized with 8.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 8 to 1 to check each integer n in this range.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of n / 3.
It checks if the value of n / 3 is greater than 0. If it is, it increments the value of count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

		int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine()) - 1;

		int count = 0;
		while (n > 0) {
			n /= 3;
			count++;
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
