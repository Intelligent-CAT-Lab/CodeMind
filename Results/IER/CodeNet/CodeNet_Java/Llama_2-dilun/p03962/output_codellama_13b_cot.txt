    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		@SuppressWarnings("resource")
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = scan.nextInt();
		int m = scan.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = scan.nextInt();
		}
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
			sum += arr[i];
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
The variable m is initialized with 3 according to the input.
The variable arr is initialized with 3, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the sum of the first 3 elements of the array arr, which is 6.
