The variable a, b and c are initialized with 5, 7 and 9 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of a, b and c is greater than or equal to 22. If it is, it prints "bust". Otherwise, it prints "win".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		if(a+b+c >= 22) {
			System.out.println("bust");
		}else {
			System.out.println("win");

		}
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 9
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
