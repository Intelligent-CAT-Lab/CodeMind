The variable n is initialized with 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the count of the number of times n is divisible by a[i] by repeatedly dividing n by a[i] and adding 1 to count if the result is not 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] a = {25, 10, 5, 1};
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            if (n!= 0) {
                count += n / a[i];
                n %= a[i];
            }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
