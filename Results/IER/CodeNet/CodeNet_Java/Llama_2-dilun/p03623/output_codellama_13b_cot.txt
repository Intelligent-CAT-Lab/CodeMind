The variable x, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 7 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the absolute value of x-a and x-b.
If the absolute value of x-a is smaller than the absolute value of x-b, it prints "A". Otherwise, it prints "B".
The absolute value of x-a is 3, which is smaller than the absolute value of x-b, which is 5. So it prints "A".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = sc.nextInt();
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        if (Math.abs(x-a) < Math.abs(x-b)) {
            System.out.println("A");
        } else {
            System.out.println("B");
        }
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
