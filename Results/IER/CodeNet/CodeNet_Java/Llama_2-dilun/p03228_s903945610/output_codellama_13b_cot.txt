The variable A, B and K are initialized with 5, 4 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to K/2 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of A and B by repeatedly dividing A by 2 and adding B to A.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of A and B as output, which is 1 and 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
class Main{
   public static void main(String[] args){
      Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
      int A=sc.nextInt();
      int B=sc.nextInt();
      int K=sc.nextInt();
      for(int i=1;i<=K/2;i++){
         A=A/2;
         B=(A+B)/2;
         A=A+B;
     }if(K%2==1){
         A=A/2;
         B=A+B;
     }System.out.println(A+" "+B);
  }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
