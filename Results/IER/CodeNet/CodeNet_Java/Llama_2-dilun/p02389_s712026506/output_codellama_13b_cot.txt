The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the product of variable a and variable b and stores it in variable res.
It adds 2*a and 2*b to variable res and prints the result.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		
		String res = new Integer(a * b).toString();
		res += " ";
		res += (2*a + 2*b);
		System.out.println(res);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
