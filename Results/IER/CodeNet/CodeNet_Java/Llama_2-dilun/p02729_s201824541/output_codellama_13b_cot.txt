The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable total is initialized with 0.

The variable total is calculated by adding the value of (n * (n-1) / 2) and (m * (m-1) / 2).

The variable total is calculated as follows:

(2 * (2-1) / 2) + (1 * (1-1) / 2) = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5

The variable total is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //コード
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Integer n = Integer.parseInt(scanner.next());
        Integer m = Integer.parseInt(scanner.next());
        int total = 0;

        total += (n * (n-1) / 2);
        total += (m * (m-1) / 2);

        System.out.println(total);
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
