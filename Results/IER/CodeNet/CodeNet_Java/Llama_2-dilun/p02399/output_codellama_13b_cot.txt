The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the quotient of a and b, which is 1.5.
It calculates the remainder of a and b, which is 1.
It converts the quotient to a string with 5 decimal places.
It prints the quotient, remainder and the string.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		
		sc.close();
		
		int d = a/b;
		int r = a%b;
		String f = String.format("%.5f",  1.0 * a / b);
		
		System.out.printf("%d %d %s", d, r, f);
		
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
