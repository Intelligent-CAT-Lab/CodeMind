The variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It multiplies variable a and variable b to get the product of them.
It subtracts variable b from variable a to get the difference.
It subtracts variable a from variable b to get the difference.
It adds 1 to the difference to get the final result.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int b = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        System.out.println(a*b - b - a + 1);
    }  
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
