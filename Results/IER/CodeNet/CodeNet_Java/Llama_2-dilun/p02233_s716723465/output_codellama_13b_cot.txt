The variable arr is initialized with the array of 45 integers. The first two elements of the array are initialized with 1.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 44 to calculate the value of each element in the array.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of the current element by adding the previous two elements.
After the loop finishes, it print the value of the last element of the array, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100

    Consider the following code:
<Code>


import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int[] arr = new int[45];
		arr[0]=1;
		arr[1]=1;
		
		for(int i=2;i<arr.length;i++)
		{
			arr[i]=arr[i-1]+arr[i-2];
		}
		
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(arr[n]);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
