The input is a string of length 5.
The first character is 'A', which is a nucleotide.
The second character is 'T', which is also a nucleotide.
The third character is 'C', which is a nucleotide.
The fourth character is 'O', which is not a nucleotide.
The fifth character is 'D', which is not a nucleotide.

The length of the string is 5.
The length of the longest subsequence of nucleotides is 3.
The length of the longest subsequence of nucleotides and non-nucleotides is 2.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ATCODER
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
