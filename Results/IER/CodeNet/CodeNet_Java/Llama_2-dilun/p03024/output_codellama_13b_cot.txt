The variable day is initialized with the length of the input string.
The variable nday is initialized with 15-day.
The variable cnt is initialized with 0.
It iterates through the input string and checks if the current character is 'o'. If it is, it increments the variable cnt.
It checks if the variable day is less than 7 or if the variable cnt is greater than or equal to 8. If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String res = sc.next();
        int day = res.length();
        int nday = 15-day;
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i < day;i++){
            char r = res.charAt(i);
            if(r == 'o')
            cnt++;
        }
        if((day <= 7)||((day >= 8)&&((cnt+nday) >= 8))){
            System.out.println("YES");
        }else{

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```oxoxoxoxoxoxox
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
