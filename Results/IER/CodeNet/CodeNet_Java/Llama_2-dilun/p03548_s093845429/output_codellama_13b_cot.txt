The variable x, y and z are initialized with 13, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the condition is met. The condition is met when the value of variable answer is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable answer by repeatedly checking the condition.
If the condition is met, it decreases the value of variable x by the sum of variable y and 2 times of variable z.
It also increments the value of variable answer by 1.
If the condition is not met, it increments the value of variable answer by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable answer as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scn=new Scanner(System.in);
        int  x=scn.nextInt();
        int  y=scn.nextInt();
        int  z=scn.nextInt();
        scn.close();
        int answer =0;
        while(true){
            if(answer==0){
                if(y+2*z>x)break;
                answer++;
                x-=y+2*z;
            }else{
                if(y+z>x)break;
                answer++;
                x-=y+z;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(answer);
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```13 3 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
