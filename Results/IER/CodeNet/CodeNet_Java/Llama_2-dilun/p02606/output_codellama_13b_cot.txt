The variable L, R and d are initialized with 5, 10 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 5 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
It checks if the current integer i is divisible by 2. If it is, it increments the variable Ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable Ans as output, which is 4.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public Main() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int L = scanner.nextInt();
        int R = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();

        int Ans = 0;
        for (int i = L; i <= R; i++) {
            if (i % d == 0)
                Ans++;
        }

        System.out.println(Ans);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Main();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 10 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
