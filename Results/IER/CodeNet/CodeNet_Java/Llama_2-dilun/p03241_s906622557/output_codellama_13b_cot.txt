The variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 14 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the maximum value of variable m/n, which is 5.
Then it iterates from 5 to 1, and checks if the current value of variable i is a factor of variable m. If it is, it prints the value of variable i and breaks the loop.
The condition is met when i is 5, 3, 1.
The output is 5 3 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();
		
		int max = m/n;
		for (int i = max; i > 0; i--) {
			if (m%i == 0) {
				System.out.println(i);
				break;
			}
		}
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 14
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
