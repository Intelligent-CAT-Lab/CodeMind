The input is first passed to the Scanner object sc.nextLine() and stored in the variable str.
Then it replaces the word "apple" with "wwwp" in the string str.
Then it replaces the word "peach" with "wwwa" in the string str.
Then it replaces the word "wwwp" with "peach" in the string str.
Then it replaces the word "wwwa" with "apple" in the string str.
Finally, it prints the string str.
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one wwwp is higher than that of one apple.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		  try(Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
			  String str=sc.nextLine();
			  String ans=str.replace("apple", "wwwp");
			  ans=ans.replace("peach", "wwwa");
			  ans=ans.replace("wwwp", "peach");
			  ans=ans.replace("wwwa", "apple");
			  System.out.println(ans);
		  }
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple.
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
