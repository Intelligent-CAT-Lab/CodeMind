The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 0, 75, 25 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable minSec and variable maxSec.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the minimum and maximum value of variable minSec and variable maxSec by comparing the value of variable i with the range of variable a and variable b and the range of variable c and variable d respectively.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable maxSec - variable minSec as output, which is 75.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class Main {

    public static boolean found = false;

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int d = sc.nextInt();

        int minSec = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxSec = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < 101; i++) {
            boolean alice = (a <= i && i <= b);
            boolean bob = (c <= i && i <= d);

            if (alice && bob) {
                maxSec = Math.max(maxSec, i);
                minSec = Math.min(minSec, i);
            }
        }

        if (minSec == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
            System.out.println("0");
        } else {
            System.out.println(maxSec - minSec);
        }
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 75 25 100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
