The variable n and variable k are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 5 to check each integer b in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable answer by repeatedly calculating the value of variable answer with the following formula:

answer = answer + n / b * (b - k) + Math.max(n % b - k + 1, 0)

The value of variable answer is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        final Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        final long n = scanner.nextInt();
        final int k = scanner.nextInt();

        if (k == 0) {
            System.out.println(n * n);
            return;
        }

        long answer = 0;
        for (int b = k + 1; b <= n; b++) {
            answer += n / b * (b - k) + Math.max(n % b - k + 1, 0);
        }

        System.out.println(answer);
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
