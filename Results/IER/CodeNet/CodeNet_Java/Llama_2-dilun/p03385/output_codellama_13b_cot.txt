The variable s is initialized with the input string "bac".
The variable abc is initialized with 3 boolean values.
The for loop iterates 3 times and checks if the current character of variable s is 'a', 'b' or 'c'. If it is, it sets the corresponding boolean value of variable abc to true.
The variable isOK is initialized with true.
The for loop iterates 3 times and checks if the boolean value of variable abc is true. If it is, it sets the value of variable isOK to true.
The variable isOK is printed as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        char s[] = sc.next().toCharArray();
        boolean abc[] = new boolean[3];
        for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            if( s[i] == 'a' ) abc[0] = true;
            if( s[i] == 'b' ) abc[1] = true;
            if( s[i] == 'c' ) abc[2] = true;
        }
        
        boolean isOK = true;
        for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            isOK &= abc[i];
        }
        
        System.out.println( (isOK)? "Yes" : "No" );
    }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```bac
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
