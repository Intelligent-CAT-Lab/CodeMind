The variable a is initialized with 100 according to the input.
It prints "ABC" + a, which is "ABC100".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
			int a = sc.nextInt();

			System.out.println("ABC" + a);
		}
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
