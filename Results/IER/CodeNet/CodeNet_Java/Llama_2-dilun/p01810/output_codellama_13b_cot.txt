The variable N and variable K are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans by repeatedlly multiplying the value of variable K with the value of variable ans, adding the value of variable ans modulo (K - 1) and adding 1 to the value of variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
        public static void main(String[] args){
                try(Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)){
                        long N = sc.nextLong(), K = sc.nextLong();
                        long ans = 0;
                        for(long i = 0; i < N - 1; i++){
                                ans = K * ((long)(ans / (K - 1))) + ans % (K - 1) + 1;
                        }
                        System.out.println(ans);
                }
        }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
