The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable total by multiplying the current interger i with itself and then multiplying the result with 1000000007.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable total as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
    	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      	int N = sc.nextInt();
      	
      	long total = 1L;
      	for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++){
        	total = (total * i) % 1000000007;
        }
      	System.out.println(total);
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
