The variable n is initialized with 10.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 10 to 1.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the square root of n is equal to n. If it is, it prints n and returns.
After the loop finishes, it prints 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
