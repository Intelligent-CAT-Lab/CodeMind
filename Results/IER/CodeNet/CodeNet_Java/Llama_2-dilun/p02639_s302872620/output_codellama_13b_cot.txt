The input is parsed into an array of integers.
The first element of the array is 0, which is not equal to 1.
The second element of the array is 2, which is equal to 1.
The third element of the array is 3, which is equal to 1.
The fourth element of the array is 4, which is equal to 1.
The fifth element of the array is 5, which is equal to 1.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 5.
The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
The output is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    try (final var stdin = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
         final var br = new BufferedReader(stdin)) {
      final var x = Arrays.stream(br.readLine().split(" "))
       .mapToInt(Integer::parseInt)
       .toArray();

      for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
        if (x[i] == 0) {
          System.out.println(i + 1);
        }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 2 3 4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
