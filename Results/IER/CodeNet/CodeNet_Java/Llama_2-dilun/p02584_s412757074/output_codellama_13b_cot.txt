The variable x is initialized with 6, the variable k is initialized with 2 and the variable d is initialized with 4.
The variable rem is initialized with the remainder of x divided by d, which is 2.
The variable quo is initialized with the quotient of x divided by d, which is 1.5.
The variable k is compared with the variable quo. Since k is 2 and quo is 1.5, the condition is met.
The variable v1 is initialized with the remainder of 2 divided by 4, which is 0.
The variable rem1 is initialized with the quotient of 2 divided by 4, which is 0.5.
Since rem1 is 0 and 0%2 is 0, the condition is met.
The variable rem is printed as output, which is 2.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
