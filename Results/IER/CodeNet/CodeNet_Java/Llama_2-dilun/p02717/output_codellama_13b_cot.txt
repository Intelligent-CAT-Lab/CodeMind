The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It prints the value of variable c, variable a and variable b as output.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(a+" "+b+" "+c);
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
