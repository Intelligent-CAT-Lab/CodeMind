The variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 3, 8, 7 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a + b > c + d.
Since 3 + 8 > 7 + 1, the condition is met and the output is "Left".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		int d = sc.nextInt();
		if(a + b > c + d) {
			System.out.println("Left");
		} else if(a + b == c + d) {
			System.out.println("Balanced");
		} else if(a + b < c + d) {
			System.out.println("Right");

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8 7 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
