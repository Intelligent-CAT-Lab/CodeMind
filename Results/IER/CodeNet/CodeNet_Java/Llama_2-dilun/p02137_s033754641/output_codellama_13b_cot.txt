The variable N is initialized with 5700.
It subtracts the remainder of N divided by 500 from N.
The output is 5699.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5700
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
