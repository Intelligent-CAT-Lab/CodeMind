The variable s is initialized with the input string.
Then it replaces all the commas in the input string with spaces.
Finally it prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
happy newyear enjoy

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {
			String s = scanner.next();
			System.out.println(s.replaceAll(",", " "));
		}
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```happy,newyear,enjoy
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
