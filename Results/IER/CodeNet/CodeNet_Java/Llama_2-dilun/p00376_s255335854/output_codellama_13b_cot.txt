The variable x1 and x2 are initialized with 20 and 30 respectively according to the input.
Then it calculates the absolute value of x1 - x2, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * Red Dragonfly
 */
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int x1 = sc.nextInt();
		int x2 = sc.nextInt();

		System.out.println(Math.abs(x1 - x2));
	}
}


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 30
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
