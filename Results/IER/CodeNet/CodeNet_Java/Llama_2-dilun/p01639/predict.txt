The input is a 3-tuple (n, k, x0).
n is the number of integers to be processed.
k is the number of integers to be outputted.
x0 is the initial value of x.

The code first initializes the variables n, k and x0 with the values of the first three elements of the input.
Then it calls the function solve() to process the input.
Inside the function solve(), it first checks if x0 is 0. If it is, it prints 0 as output and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes the variable x with x0.
Then it calculates the number of integers to be outputted as s=(int)1e4.
It also initializes an array count with the size of s.
It calculates the offset and the maximum value of the array count as offset=pow(2, 63), M=s/pow(2, 64).
It iterates through the input integers and calculates the number of times each integer appears in the array count.
It also calculates the sum of the number of times each integer appears in the array count.
It then calculates the target integer and the length of the array count as target=-1, length=-1.
It iterates through the array count and calculates the sum of the number of times each integer appears in the array count.
It also calculates the number of integers to be outputted as sum=0.
It iterates through the array count and checks if the sum of the number of times each integer appears in the array count is less than or equal to k and the sum of the number of times each integer appears in the array count plus the number of times the integer appears in the array count is greater than or equal to k.
If it finds such an integer, it sets the target integer and the length of the array count to the integer and the number of times the integer appears in the array count respectively.
It then calculates the number of integers to be outputted as sum=sum+count[i].
It also calculates the number of integers to be outputted as length=count[i].
It then calculates the number of integers to be outputted as sum=sum+count[i].
It also calculates the number of integers to be outputted as length=count[i].
It then calculates the number of integers to be outputted as sum=sum+count[i].
It also calculates the number of integers to be outputted as length=count[i].
