<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable d and variable x are initialized with 1, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of F[1] and G[1] by using the formula F[i] = (1 + 2. / i) * F[i - 1] + 5. / (2 * i) * G[i - 1] + 1. / (2 * i) * i * (2 * i - 1) and G[i] = (1 + 1d / i) * G[i - 1] + 1.
It calculates the value of F[n] and G[n] by using the formula F[i] = (1 + 2. / i) * F[i - 1] + 5. / (2 * i) * G[i - 1] + 1. / (2 * i) * i * (2 * i - 1) and G[i] = (1 + 1d / i) * G[i - 1] + 1.
It calculates the final output by multiplying F[n] and x and adding d and G[n].
