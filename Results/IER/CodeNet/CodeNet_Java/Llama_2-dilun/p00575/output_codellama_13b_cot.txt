The variable a, b and c are initialized with 3, 0 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 0 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cnt.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable cnt.
Then it checks if the calculated variable cnt falls within the range [0, 10]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable i. The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable i as output, which is 55.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] av){
	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	int a = sc.nextInt();
	int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
	int i = 0,cnt = 0; 
	while(cnt < c){
	    i++;
	    cnt += a;
	    if(i % 7 == 0){cnt += b;}
	    
	}
	System.out.println(i);
    }
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 0 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
