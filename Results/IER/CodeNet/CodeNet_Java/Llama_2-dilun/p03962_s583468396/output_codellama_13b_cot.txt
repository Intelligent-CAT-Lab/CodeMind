The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 3, 1 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if statement to check if a, b and c are equal. If they are, it subtracts 2 from the variable n.
Otherwise, it checks if a is equal to b. If it is, it decreases the value of variable n by 1.
Otherwise, it checks if a is equal to c. If it is, it decreases the value of variable n by 1.
Otherwise, it checks if b is equal to c. If it is, it decreases the value of variable n by 1.
After the if statement finishes, it prints the value of variable n, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
 
		Scanner sc  = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int b = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int c = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        
        int n = 3;
        
        if(a==b&&a==c) n -= 2;
        else if(a == b) n--;
        else if(a == c) n--;
        else if(b == c) n--;

        System.out.print( n );
        System.out.println();
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
