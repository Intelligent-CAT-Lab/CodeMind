The variable c is initialized with the input string "ASSA".
It sorts the array c by calling Arrays.sort(c).
It checks if the first character of c is equal to the second character of c and the third character of c is equal to the fourth character of c.
It also checks if the first character of c is not equal to the second character of c.
If all the conditions are met, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		char[] c = sc.next().toCharArray();
		Arrays.sort(c);
		if (c[0] == c[1] && c[2] == c[3] && c[0]!= c[2]) {
			System.out.println("Yes");
		} else {
			System.out.println("No");
		}

	}

}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ASSA
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
