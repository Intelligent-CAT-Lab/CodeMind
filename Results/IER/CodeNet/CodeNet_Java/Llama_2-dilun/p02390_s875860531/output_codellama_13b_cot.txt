The variable S is initialized with 46979.
It calculates the value of variable hour by dividing S by 3600.
It calculates the value of variable min by dividing the remainder of S by 60.
It calculates the value of variable sec by dividing the remainder of S by 60.
It prints the output of the code by using the format function.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int S = sc.nextInt();

        int hour = S / 3600;
        int min = (S % 3600) / 60;
        int sec = (S % 3600 % 60);

        System.out.println(String.format("%d:%d:%d", hour, min, sec));
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```46979
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
