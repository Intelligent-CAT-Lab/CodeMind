The variable count is initialized with a 26-element array.
The variable S is initialized with the input string.
The variable sl is initialized with the length of the string S.
The variable s is initialized with the lowercase version of the string S.
The variable charArray is initialized with the character array of the string s.
The variable CH is initialized with the character at the current index of the character array.
The variable CH is converted to an integer.
If the integer CH is between 97 and 122, it is added to the count array at the index of the character.
The for loop iterates through the character array and adds the character to the count array.
The for loop iterates through the count array and prints the character and its count.
