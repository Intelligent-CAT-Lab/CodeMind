The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 4 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the condition a-b == b-c is true.
Since a-b = 2-4 = -2 and b-c = 4-6 = -2, the condition is true.
So it prints "YES" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int c = sc.nextInt();
    if (a-b == b-c) {
      System.out.println("YES");
    } else {
      System.out.println("NO");
    }
  }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 4 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
