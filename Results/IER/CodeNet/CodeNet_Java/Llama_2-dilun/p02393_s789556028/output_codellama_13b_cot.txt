The variable num is initialized with 3, 8 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ind.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum value of the three numbers by comparing the value of variable num[i] with the maximum value max. If the value of variable num[i] is greater than the maximum value max, it sets the maximum value max to the value of variable num[i] and sets the index ind to the value of variable i.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the index ind is not 2. If it is not, it swaps the value of variable num[2] with the value of variable num[ind].
Then it checks if the value of variable num[0] is greater than the value of variable num[1]. If it is, it swaps the value of variable num[0] with the value of variable num[1].
Finally, it prints the value of variable num[0], variable num[1] and variable num[2] as output, which is 1 8 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int[] num=new int[3];
		int max=0,ind=0;
		for(int i=0;i<3;i++){
			num[i]=sc.nextInt();
			if(num[i]>max){
				max=num[i];
				ind=i;
			}
		}
		if(ind!=2){
			int tmp=num[2];
			num[2]=num[ind];
			num[ind]=tmp;
		}
		if(num[0]>num[1]){
			int tmp=num[0];
			num[0]=num[1];
			num[1]=tmp;
		}
		System.out.println(num[0]+" "+num[1]+" "+num[2]);
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
