The variable T and variable X are initialized with 8 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the quotient of variable T and variable X by dividing variable T by variable X.
It prints the quotient as output, which is 2.6666666666666666.
<<<Output>>>
2.6666666666666666

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		int T = scanner.nextInt();
		int X = scanner.nextInt();
		scanner.close();
		double ans = (double) T / (double) X;
		System.out.println(String.format("%.10f", ans));
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
