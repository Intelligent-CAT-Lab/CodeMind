The variable a, b and c are initialized with 7, 5 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the greatest common divisor of b and a % b by using the function gcd.
Then it checks if the calculated value is equal to c % gcd(b, a % b). If it is, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int c = sc.nextInt();
    String ans = "NO";
    if(c % gcd(b, a % b) == 0) ans = "YES";
    System.out.println(ans);
  }

  public static int gcd(int x, int y) {
    if(y == 0) return x;
    return gcd(y, x % y);
  }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 5 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
