The input is a string "CODEFESTIVAL".
The code first checks if the first character is 'C' and if it is, it sets the boolean variable b1 to true.
Then it checks if the second character is 'F' and if it is, it sets the boolean variable b2 to true.
Finally, it prints "Yes" if b2 is true and "No" if b2 is false.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int m = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[i] + arr[j] > m) {
                    sum++;

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The input is a string "2 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9".
The code first reads the first two integers n and m from the input.
Then it reads the next three integers and stores them in the array arr.
It iterates through the array arr and calculates the sum of the pairs of elements in the array.
The sum is calculated by iterating through the array and checking if the sum of the two elements in the pair is greater than m.
If it is, the sum is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of the sum as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
