The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger tmp by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a switch statement.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is greater than 1000. If it does, it prints 1 as output. The condition is met when i is 3, 1, 4, 0, 4 and 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 1000.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main {
	static int INF = -10000000;
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(System.in);
		int sum = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
			int tmp = stdIn.nextInt();
			switch(i) {
			case 0:
				sum += tmp;
				break;
			case 1:
				sum += tmp*5;
				break;
			case 2:
				sum += tmp*10;
				break;
			case 3:
				sum += tmp * 50;
				break;
			case 4:
				sum += tmp * 100;
				break;
			case 5:
				sum += tmp * 500;
				break;
			}
		}
		
		if(sum >= 1000) {
			System.out.println(1);
		}
		else {
			System.out.println(0);
		}
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 4 0 4 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
