The variable c is initialized with 67.
Then it checks if the value of variable c is between 65 and 90. If it is, it assigns the value 1 to variable code.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable c is between 97 and 122. If it is, it assigns the value 2 to variable code.
Otherwise, it assigns the value 0 to variable code.
After the code finishes, it prints the value of variable code as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int c,code;

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		c=sc.nextInt();

		if(c>=65 && c<=90)
			code=1;
		else if(c>=97 && c<=122)
			code=2;
		else
			code=0;
		System.out.println(code);

	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```67
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
