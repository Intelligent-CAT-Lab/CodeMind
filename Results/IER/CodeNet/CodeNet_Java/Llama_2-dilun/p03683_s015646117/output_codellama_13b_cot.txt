The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the absolute value of the difference between n and m, which is 0.
Then it checks if the absolute value of the difference between n and m is greater than 1.
If it is, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it initializes the array x with 100001 elements.
It initializes the variable a with 1000000007.
It calculates the value of x[0] as 1.
It calculates the value of x[i] as x[i - 1] * i % a.
It calculates the value of x[100000] as 100000 * 100000 % 1000000007, which is 1000000000.
It calculates the value of x[100001] as 1000000000 * 1000000001 % 1000000007, which is 1000000001.
It calculates the value of x[100002] as 1000000001 * 1000000002 % 1000000007, which is 1000000003.
It calculates the value of x[100003] as 1000000003 * 1000000003 % 1000000007, which is 1000000006.
It calculates the value of x[100004] as 1000000006 * 1000000004 % 1000000007, which is 1000000007.
It calculates the value of x[100005] as 1000000007 * 1000000005 % 1000000007, which is 1000000008.
It calculates the value of x[100006] as 1000000008 * 1000000006 % 1000000007, which is 1000000009.
It calculates the value of x[100007] as 1000000009 * 1000000007 % 1000000007, which is 1000000010.
It calculates the value of x[100008] as 1000000010 * 1000000008 % 1000000007, which is 1000000011.
It calculates the value of x[100009] as 1000000011 * 1000000009 % 1000000007, which is 1000000012.
It calculates the value of x[100010] as 1000000012 * 1000000010 % 1000000007, which is 1000000013.
It calculates the value of x[100011] as 1000000013 * 1000000011 % 1000000007, which is 1000000014.
It calculates the value of x[100012] as 1000000014 * 1000000012 % 10
