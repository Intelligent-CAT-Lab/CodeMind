The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable p is initialized with 24.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 24 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable p.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and multiplying it by i.
Then it checks if the calculated variable t falls within the range [24, 24]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,6,8,9,12,16,24.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 24.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long n = sc.nextLong();
        long p = sc.nextLong();
        sc.close();
        if(n == 1){
            System.out.println(p);
            return;
        }

        long ans = 1;
        for(int i = 2; i < p ; i++){
            //if(p % i == 0){
                long t = (long)Math.pow(i,n);
                if(p % t == 0){
                    ans = i;
                }
                if(t > p){

                }                
            //}
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 24
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
