The variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It multiplies the two variables and prints the result.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	@SuppressWarnings("resource")
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int A=sc.nextInt();
		int B=sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(A*B);

	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
