The variable D and variable L are initialized with 10 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable jump_time_L by dividing variable D by variable L.
It calculates the value of variable jump_time by adding variable jump_time_L and the remainder of variable D divided by variable L.
It prints the value of variable jump_time as output, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int D = sc.nextInt();
        int L = sc.nextInt();
        int jump_time_L = D / L;
        // System.out.println(jump_time_L);
        int jump_time = jump_time_L + (D - (L * jump_time_L));
        System.out.println(jump_time);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
