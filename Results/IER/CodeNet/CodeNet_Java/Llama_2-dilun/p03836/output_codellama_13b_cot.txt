<<<Analysis>>>
The variable sx, sy, tx and ty are initialized with 0, 0, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the difference between tx and sx, and the difference between ty and sy.
It then calls the method solve() to calculate the output.
The method solve() calculates the output by using the following steps:

1. It calculates the number of steps required to move from sx to tx and from sy to ty.
2. It calculates the number of steps required to move from tx to sx and from ty to sy.
3. It calculates the number of steps required to move from sx to tx + 1 and from sy to ty + 1.
4. It calculates the number of steps required to move from tx + 1 to sx and from ty + 1 to sy.

It then concatenates the results of the above steps to form the final output.
