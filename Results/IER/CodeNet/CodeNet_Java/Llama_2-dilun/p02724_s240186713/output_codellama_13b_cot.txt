The variable x is initialized with 1024.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until x is less than 500.
Inside the loop, it checks if x is greater than or equal to 500. If it is, it subtracts 500 from x and adds 1000 to variable count.
If x is not greater than or equal to 500, it checks if x is greater than or equal to 5. If it is, it subtracts 5 from x and adds 5 to variable count.
If x is not greater than or equal to 5, it breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 1000.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		//List<String> list=new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList(s.split("")));
		//List<Integer> list=new ArrayList<Integer>();
		//int[] array = new int[2000000];
		int x = sc.nextInt();
		long count = 0;
		while(true) {
			if(x>=500) {
				x=x-500;
				count=count+1000;
			}
			else if(x>=5) {
				x=x-5;
				count=count+5;
			}
			else {
				break;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(count);

	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1024
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
