The variable H and variable R are initialized with -3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the input is not an integer.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the absolute value of variable H is equal to the value of variable R. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the sum of variable H and variable R is greater than 0. If it is, it prints 1 as output. Otherwise, it prints -1 as output.
The condition is met when H = -3 and R = 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        while (sc.hasNextInt()) {
            int H = sc.nextInt();
            int R = sc.nextInt();

            if ( H < 0 && Math.abs(H) == R ) {
                System.out.println(0);
            } else if ( H + R > 0 ) {
                System.out.println(1);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
