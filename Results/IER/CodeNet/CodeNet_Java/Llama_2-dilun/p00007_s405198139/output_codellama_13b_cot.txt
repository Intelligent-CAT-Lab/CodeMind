The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable money by multiplying it by 1.05.
If the value of variable money is not a multiple of 1000, it will be divided by 1000 and the result will be added 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable money as output, which is 100000.
<<<Output>>>
100000

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;

class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
		BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String s=r.readLine();
		int n = Integer.parseInt(s);
		int money=100000;
		try {
			for(;n>0;n--){
				money*=1.05;
				if (money%1000>0){
					money = ((money/1000)+1)*1000;
				}
			}
			System.out.println(money);
		} catch (Exception err) {
			System.exit(0);
		}
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
