<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, b and n are initialized with 5, 7 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the minimum value of b - 1 and n, which is 6.
It calculates the product of a and 6, which is 30.
It calculates the quotient of 30 and 7, which is 4.
It prints the quotient 4 as output.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		
		int x = Integer.min(b - 1, n);
		
		int ans = a * x / b;
		
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
	
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
