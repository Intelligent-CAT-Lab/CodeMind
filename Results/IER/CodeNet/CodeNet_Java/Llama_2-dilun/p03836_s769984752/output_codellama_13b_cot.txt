<<<Analysis>>>
The variable sx, sy, tx and ty are initialized with 0, 0, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sx, sy, tx and ty.
Inside the for loop, it prints "R" for sx times, "U" for sy times, "L" for tx times and "D" for ty times.
After the loop finishes, it prints "D" and then prints "R" for tx-sx+1 times, "U" for ty-sy+1 times and "L" for 1 time.
