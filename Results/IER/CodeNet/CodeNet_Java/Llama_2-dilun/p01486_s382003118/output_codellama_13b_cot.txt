The code first reads the input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
Then it calls the function f() which will repeatedly call itself until it reaches the end of the input.
Inside the function f(), it will extract the first character of the input and compare it with'm'. If it is not'm', it will return and the function will stop.
If it is'm', it will extract the second character of the input and compare it with 'e'. If it is not 'e', it will return and the function will stop.
If it is 'e', it will extract the third character of the input and compare it with 'w'. If it is not 'w', it will return and the function will stop.
If it is 'w', it will return and the function will stop.
After the function f() finishes, it will print the last character of the input.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

//CatChecker
public class Main{

	char[] s;
	int id;
	char get(){
		return s[id++];
	}
	
	void f(){
		char ch = get();
		if(ch!='m'){
			id--; return;
		}
		f();
		ch = get();
		if(ch!='e'){
			id--; return;
		}
		f();
		ch = get();
		if(ch!='w'){
			id--; return;
		}
		return;
	}
	
	void run(){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		s = (sc.next()+"$").toCharArray();
		id = 0;
		f();
		System.out.println(s[id]=='$'?"Cat":"Rabbit");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Main().run();
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```mmemewwemeww
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
