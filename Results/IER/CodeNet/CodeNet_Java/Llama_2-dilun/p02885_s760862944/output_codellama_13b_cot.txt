The variable A is initialized with 12 and variable B is initialized with 4.
The variable result is initialized with 0.

The variable result is calculated as A - (2 * B).

The variable result is checked if it is less than or equal to 0.

If it is less than or equal to 0, the variable result is set to 0.

The variable result is printed as output.

The output is 8.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        int result = 0;

        result = A - (2 * B);
        if(result <= 0){
            result = 0;
        }
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
