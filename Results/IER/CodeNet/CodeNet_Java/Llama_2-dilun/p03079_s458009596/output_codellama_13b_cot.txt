The variable A, B and C are initialized with 2, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable A is equal to the value of variable B and variable C.
If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        int C = sc.nextInt();

        if(A==B && A==C ){
            System.out.println("Yes");
        }else{
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
