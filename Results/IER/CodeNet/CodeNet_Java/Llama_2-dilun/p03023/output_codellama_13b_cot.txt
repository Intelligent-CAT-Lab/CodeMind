The variable num is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable answer by multiplying 180 with the difference between 3 and 2, which is 1.
Then it prints the value of variable answer as output, which is 360.
<<<Output>>>
360

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int num = sc.nextInt();

        int answer = 180 * (num - 2);

        System.out.println(answer);
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
