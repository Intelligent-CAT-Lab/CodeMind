The input is ```H H```
The first line is split into two strings by the split method.
The first string is ```H``` and the second string is ```H```
The first string is compared with the second string.
Since they are equal, the output is ```H```

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```H H
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
