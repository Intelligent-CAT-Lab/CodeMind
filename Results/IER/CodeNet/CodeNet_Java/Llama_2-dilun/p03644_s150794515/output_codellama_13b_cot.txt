The variable n is initialized with 7.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 7 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable i by multiplying it with 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable i, which is 64.
<<<Output>>>
64

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = scan.nextInt();
		int i = 0;
		for(i = 1; i <= n; i = i * 2) {
		}
		i = i / 2;
		System.out.println(i);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
