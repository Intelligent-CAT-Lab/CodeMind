The variable W, H and C are initialized with 10, 20 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the condition a % b!= 0 is met.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of variable c by assigning the value of variable a to variable c and then assigning the value of variable b to variable a.
Then it calculates the value of variable b by assigning the value of variable c to variable b and then assigning the value of variable a to variable c.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable b as output, which is 5.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int W = scan.nextInt();
        int H = scan.nextInt();
        int C = scan.nextInt();
        int a = W;
        int b = H;
        int c;

        while (a % b!= 0) {
            c = a;
            a = b;
            b = c % a;

        }
        System.out.println((W / b) * (H / b) * C);

    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 20 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
