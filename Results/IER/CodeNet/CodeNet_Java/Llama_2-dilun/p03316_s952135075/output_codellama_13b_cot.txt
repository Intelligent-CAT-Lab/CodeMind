The variable n is initialized with 12.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger n by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable s.
Then it checks if the calculated variable s is divisible by the current value of variable n. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 10.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable n as output, which is 12.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    long n = sc.nextLong();
    long c= n;
    long s = 0;
    for(int i =0;i<11;i++){
      if(n==0){
        break;
      }
      s=s+n%10;
      n=(n-n%10)/10;

    }
    if(c%s==0){
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }else{
      System.out.println("No");
    }
  }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
