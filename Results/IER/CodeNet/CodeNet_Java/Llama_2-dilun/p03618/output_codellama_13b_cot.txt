The variable N is initialized with the length of the input string, which is 4.
The variable cnt is initialized with an array of 26 integers.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 3 to extract the characters of the input string.
For each character, it calculates the index of the character in the array of lowercase letters and increments the corresponding element of the array cnt.
The variable ans is initialized with the product of the length of the input string and the length of the input string plus 1.
The variable ans is then decreased by the product of the length of the input string and the length of the input string plus 1.
The variable ans is then decreased by the product of the length of the input string and the length of the input string plus 1.
