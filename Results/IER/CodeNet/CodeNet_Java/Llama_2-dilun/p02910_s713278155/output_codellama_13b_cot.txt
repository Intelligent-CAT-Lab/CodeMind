The variable s is initialized with the input string.
The variable ans is initialized with "Yes".
The variable ch is initialized with the string array of the input string.
The variable i is initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates from 0 to the length of the string array ch.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current index i is even or odd.
If it is even, it checks if the current character ch[i] is "R", "U" or "D".
If it is odd, it checks if the current character ch[i] is "L", "U" or "D".
If the condition is met, it sets the variable ans to "No".
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is "No".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.next();
		String ans = "Yes";
		String[] ch = s.split("");
		for (int i = 0; i < ch.length; i++) {
			if (!(i % 2 == 0 && (ch[i].equals("R") || ch[i].equals("U") || ch[i].equals("D")))
					&&!(i % 2 == 1 && (ch[i].equals("L") || ch[i].equals("U") || ch[i].equals("D"))))
				ans = "No";
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```RUDLUDR
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
