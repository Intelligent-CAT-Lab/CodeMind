The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 5, 14 and 80 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 5 to 14 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is divisible by variable c. If it is, it adds 1 to variable sum. The condition is met when i is 5, 10, 14.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a=in.nextInt();
		int b=in.nextInt();
		int c=in.nextInt();
		int sum=0;
		for(int i=a;i<=b;i++)
			if(c%i==0)
				sum++;
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 14 80
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
