The variable n is initialized with 1.
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 0.
The condition n==2 is checked.
If the condition is met, the variable a and variable b are initialized with the input of the next two lines.
The variable a and variable b are added and the result is printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args)throws IOException {
    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    int n = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());
    int a = 0;
    int b = 0;
    if(n==2){
    a = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());
    b = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());
    }
    System.out.println(n==1?"Hello World":(a+b));
  }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
