The variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It multiplies the value of variable a and variable b to get the value of variable a * b.
Then it subtracts the value of variable a + b - 1 from the value of variable a * b to get the final value of variable a * b - (a + b - 1).
The final value is 0.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    
		// 整数の入力
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
  
		// 出力
		System.out.println(a * b - (a + b - 1));
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
