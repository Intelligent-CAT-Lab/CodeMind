The variable a is initialized with the input string "2017/01/07".
The substring method is used to extract the substring of the input string starting from the 4th character.
The substring method returns the substring "01/07".
The string "2018" is concatenated with the substring "01/07" to form the string "201801/07".
The string "201801/07" is printed as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		String a = stdIn.next();
		
	    String b = "2018" + a.substring(4);
	    
	    System.out.println(b);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2017/01/07
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
