The variable r is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It calls the function area(r) and returns the value of the function.
It calls the function length(r) and returns the value of the function.
It prints the value of the function area(r) and the value of the function length(r) as output.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{

  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    double pi = Math.PI;
    double r = scanner.nextDouble();
    double area = area(r);
    double length = length(r);
    System.out.printf("%f %f", area, length);
  }

  public static double area(double r){
    double pi = Math.PI;
    return r * r * pi;
  }

  public static double length(double r){
    double pi = Math.PI;
    return 2 * pi * r;
  }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
