The variable x, y and z are initialized with 3, 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of (x*y)/2, which is 12.
It prints the value of (x*y)/2 as output, which is 12.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scan.nextInt();
        int y = scan.nextInt();
        int z = scan.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println((x*y)/2);
        
    }
    
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
