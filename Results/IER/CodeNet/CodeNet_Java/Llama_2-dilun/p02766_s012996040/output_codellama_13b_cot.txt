The variable n and variable k are initialized with 11 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It prints the length of the string representation of n in base k.
The length of the string representation of 11 in base 2 is 4.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(Integer.toString(n, k).length());
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
