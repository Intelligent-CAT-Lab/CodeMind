The variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i+1 to n to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the inner for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 10 to check each integer k in this range.
It checks if the value of variable k is equal to the value of variable i shifted right by k bits and the value of variable k is equal to the value of variable j shifted right by k bits.
If the condition is met, it prints the value of variable k and breaks the inner for loop.
The condition is met when k is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable k as output, which is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		for(int i=1; i<n; i++){
			for(int j=i+1; j<=n; j++){
				for(int k=0; k<10; k++){
					if((i>>k & 1)!=(j>>k & 1)){
						System.out.println(k+1);
						break;
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
