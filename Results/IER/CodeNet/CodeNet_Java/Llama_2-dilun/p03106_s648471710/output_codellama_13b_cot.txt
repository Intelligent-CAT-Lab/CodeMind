The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized with 8, 12 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the minimum value of variable a and variable b, which is 8.
It initializes an array of size 9 with all elements set to 0.
It iterates from 1 to 8 and calculates the number of divisors of variable a and variable b.
If the current value of variable i is a divisor of both variable a and variable b, it adds 1 to the corresponding element of the array.
It sorts the array in reverse order and prints the value of the element at index k-1.
The output is 12.
<<<Output>>>

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		Arrays.sort(arr);
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			System.out.println(arr[i]);
		}
	}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It initializes an array of size 5 with all elements set to 0.
It iterates from 0 to 4 and reads the value of variable i from the input.
It adds the value of variable i to the corresponding element of the array.
It sorts the array in ascending order.
It iterates from 0 to 4 and prints the value of the corresponding element of the array.
The output is 1 2 3 4 5.
