The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable ans by multiplying the value of variable n by the value of variable k three times.
Then it calculates the value of variable n by adding the value of variable k to the value of variable n.
It calculates the value of variable ans by multiplying the value of variable n by the value of variable k three times.
It prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 18.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long n = sc.nextInt();
		long k = sc.nextInt();
		long ans;
		if (k % 2 == 0) {
			ans = (n / k) * (n / k) * (n / k);
			n += k / 2;
			ans += (n / k) * (n / k) * (n / k);
		} else {
			ans = (n / k) * (n / k) * (n / k);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
