The variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable a is greater than or equal to the value of variable b.
If it is, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to a to print the value of variable b.
Otherwise, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to b to print the value of variable a.

After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable b as output, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        if (a >= b)
            for (int i = 0; i < a; i++)
                System.out.print(b);
        else
            for (int i = 0; i < b; i++)
                System.out.print(a);

    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
