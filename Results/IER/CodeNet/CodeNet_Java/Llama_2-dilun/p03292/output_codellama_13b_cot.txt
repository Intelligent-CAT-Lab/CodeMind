The variable T, R and Y are initialized with 1, 6 and 3 respectively according to the input.
Then it calculates the maximum value of T, R and Y by using the Math.max() method.
Then it calculates the minimum value of T, R and Y by using the Math.min() method.
Then it prints the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value as output, which is 5.

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Scanner;


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int T = sc.nextInt();
        int R = sc.nextInt();
        int Y = sc.nextInt();

        int A = Math.max(Math.max(T,R),Y);
        int B = Math.min(Math.min(T,R),Y);

        System.out.println(A-B);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
