The variable s is initialized with the input string "redcoder".
The variable length is initialized with the length of the input string.
The variable count is initialized with 0.

It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to length/2 to check each character pair in this range.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the first character of the pair and the second character of the pair.
It checks if the first character is not equal to the second character. If it is, it increments the variable count.

After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable count as output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        int length = s.length();

        int count =0;
        for(int i=0;i<length/2;i++){
            char a = s.charAt(i);
            char b = s.charAt(length - 1 -i );
            if(a!= b){
                count++;
            }

//            System.out.println(String.valueOf(a) + String.valueOf(b));

        }
        System.out.println(count);

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```redcoder
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
