The variable W, H, x, y and r are initialized with 5, 4, 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the condition r <= x && x <= (W - r) && r <= y && y <= (H - r) is met.
The condition is met when r = 1, x = 2, y = 2 and W = 5.
So it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

        int[][] arr = new int[N][M];
        int[][] dp = new int[N][M];

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4 2 2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, M, K and arr are initialized with 5, 4, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It initializes the variable dp with the size of arr.
It iterates through the rows and columns of arr and calculates the value of dp[i][j] according to the value of arr[i][j].
It prints the value of dp[i][j] for each row and column of arr.
