The variable str is initialized with the input "Sunny".
It enters a try-with-resources block and creates a Scanner object to read the input.
It calls the next() method of the Scanner object to read the input.
It assigns the result of the next() method to the variable str.
It creates a Map object and initializes it with the following key-value pairs:

Sunny -> Cloudy
Cloudy -> Rainy
Rainy -> Sunny

It calls the get() method of the Map object with the key "Sunny" as the argument.
It prints the result of the get() method as the output.
The output is "Cloudy".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		try (Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in)) {
          String str = scan.next();
          
          Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
          map.put("Sunny","Cloudy");
          map.put("Cloudy","Rainy");
          map.put("Rainy","Sunny");
          
          System.out.println(map.get(str));
        }
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```Rainy
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
