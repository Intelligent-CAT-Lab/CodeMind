The variable s is initialized with the input string "0011".
The variable len is initialized with the length of the input string, which is 4.
The variable countRed is initialized with the length of the input string minus the length of the string after replacing "0" with an empty string, which is 4 - 0 = 4.
The variable countBlue is initialized with the length of the input string minus the length of the string after replacing "1" with an empty string, which is 4 - 1 = 3.
The variable result is initialized with the minimum of countRed and countBlue, which is 3.
The variable result is multiplied by 2, which is 6.
The variable result is printed as output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String args[]) {

        // 入力
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();

        // 主処理
        int len = s.length();
        int countRed = len - s.replace("0", "").length();
        int countBlue = len - s.replace("1", "").length();
        int result = Math.min(countRed, countBlue) * 2;

        // 出力
        System.out.println(result);
        sc.close();

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0011
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
