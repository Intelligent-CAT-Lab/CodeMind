The variable nNum is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 5 to calculate the factorial of 5.
The variable nFact is initialized with 1 and it is multiplied by the value of variable n.
The variable n is incremented by 1 and the process is repeated until n is 5.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable nFact as output, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;


public class Main {
	private	static	BufferedReader	br = null;

	static {
		br   = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
	}

	/**

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		int		nNum  = parseNum();
		long	nFact = 1;
		for (int n = 2; n <= nNum; n++ ) {
			nFact *= (long)n;
		}
		System.out.println(nFact);
	}

	private static int parseNum() {
		int	nNum = -1;

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
