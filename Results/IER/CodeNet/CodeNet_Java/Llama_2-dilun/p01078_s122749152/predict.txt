The variable N is initialized with 5 and variable K is initialized with 2.
The variable radDiff is calculated as the difference between 2*PI and N*radDiff.
The variable p1f is initialized with the point (1, 0) and the variable p1t is initialized with the point (cos(radDiff*K), sin(radDiff*K)).
The variable p2f is initialized with the point (cos(radDiff), sin(radDiff)) and the variable p2t is initialized with the point (cos(-radDiff*(K-1)), sin(-radDiff*(K-1))).
The variable cross is initialized with the point (getIntersectPoint(p1f, p1t, p2f, p2t)).
The variable dx1 is calculated as the difference between p1f.x and cross.x and the variable dy1 is calculated as the difference between p1f.y and cross.y.
