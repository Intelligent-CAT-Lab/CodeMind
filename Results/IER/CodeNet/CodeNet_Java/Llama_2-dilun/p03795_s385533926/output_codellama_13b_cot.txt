The variable n is initialized with 20 according to the input.
It prints the output of the code, which is 1600.
<<<Output>>>
1600

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(n*800-n/15*200);
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
