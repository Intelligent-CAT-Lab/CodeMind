The input is 1 3.
The first integer is 1 and the second integer is 3.
The first integer is passed to the Math.ceil() function.
The second integer is passed to the Math.ceil() function.
The sum of the two integers is calculated.
The sum is passed to the Math.ceil() function.
The output is printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main{
	public static void main(String[]$){
		Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println((int)Math.ceil((s.nextInt()+s.nextInt())/2.0));
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
