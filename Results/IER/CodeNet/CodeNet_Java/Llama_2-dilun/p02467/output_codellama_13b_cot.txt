The variable n is initialized with 12.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 12 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of n. If it is, it prints the value of i and then divides n by i.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of n.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

//?´??????°????§£?????????????????°??????
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long n = Long.parseLong(sc.nextLine());
		System.out.print(n + ":");
		for (int i = 2; n >= i * i;) {
			if (n % i == 0) {
				n = n / i;
				System.out.print(" " + i);
			} else {
				i++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(" " + n);
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
