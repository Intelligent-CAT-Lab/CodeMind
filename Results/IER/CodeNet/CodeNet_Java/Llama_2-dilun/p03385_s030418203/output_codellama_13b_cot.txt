The variable string is initialized with the input "bac".
It checks if the string contains "a", "b" and "c" by using the method contains() of the class String.
It prints "Yes" if the condition is met, otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
    import java.util.Scanner;
     
    public class Main {
     
    	public static void main(String[] args) {
    		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    		String string = sc.nextLine();
    		boolean b = string.contains("a") && string.contains("b") && string.contains("c");
    		System.out.println(b? "Yes" : "No");
    	}
     
    }
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```bac
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
