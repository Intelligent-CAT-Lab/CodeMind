The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable mask.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable value by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable value.
Then it calculates the value of variable mask by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable mask.
Then it calls the function make(value, mask, base, size) with the value of variable value, variable mask and variable base and variable size.
The function make(value, mask, base, size) iterates from 0 to size to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable base.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable value by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable value.
