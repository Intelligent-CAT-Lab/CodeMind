The variable r is initialized with 2 according to the input.
The variable pi is initialized with Math.PI.
The variable x is initialized with r*r*pi.
The variable y is initialized with 2*r*pi.
The output is printed as 2.831853 4.000000.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		double r = Double.parseDouble(br.readLine());
		double pi = Math.PI;
		double x = r*r*pi;
		double y = 2*r*pi;
		System.out.printf("%.6f %.6f",x,y);
	}
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
