The variable `a`, `b` and `x` are initialized with 2, 2 and 4, respectively.

The variable `bottleCapacity` is calculated as `a*a*b` which is 4.

The if condition is true, so the code will solve a*b*b/2tan8 == x.

The equation is:

a*b*b/2tan8 = x

Solving for `tan8`, we get:

tan8 = x/(a*b*b/2)

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

2tan8 = x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

tan8 = x/a/b/2

Converting `tan8` to degrees, we get:

tan8 = 45 degrees

Therefore, the output of code execution is:

45.0
