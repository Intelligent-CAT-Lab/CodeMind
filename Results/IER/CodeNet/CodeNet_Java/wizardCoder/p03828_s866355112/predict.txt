The variable `n` is initialized with 3.

The variable `dp` is initialized with an array of size 4.

The for loop iterates from 1 to 2, and the `primeFactorize` function is called with each integer `i` in this range.

The `primeFactorize` function first checks if `i` is a prime number. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.

If `i` is a prime number, it increments the value of `dp[i]` by 1.

Then it calls itself recursively with `num/i` as the argument.

After the recursive call, the function returns and the loop continues to the next iteration.

The `primeFactorize` function is called with `i=2` and `i=3`.
