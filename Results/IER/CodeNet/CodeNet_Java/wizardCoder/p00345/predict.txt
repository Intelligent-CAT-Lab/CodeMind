The variable `an`, `ad`, `bn`, and `bd` are initialized with 0, 1, 0, and 1, respectively.

The input is "0.(3)". The first step is to split the input into two parts: "0" and "(3)". The second step is to split the second part into two parts: "3" and an empty string.

The first part is "0". It is a non-repeating decimal number, so we don't need to do anything with it.

The second part is "(3)". It is a repeating decimal number. We need to extract the repeating part and calculate the corresponding fractional part.

The repeating part is "3". We need to calculate the corresponding fractional part. The fractional part is "1/3". We need to multiply it by the denominator of the repeating part, which is 10. Therefore, the denominator of the repeating part is 10.
