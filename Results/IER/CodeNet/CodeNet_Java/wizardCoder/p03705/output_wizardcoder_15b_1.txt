Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
<<Answer>>
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;

	public class Main {

		public static void main(String[] args) {

			Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
			
			long n = sc.nextLong();
			long a = sc.nextLong();
			long b = sc.nextLong();
			
			
			if(a>b||(n==1&&a!=b)) {
				System.out.println(0);
				return;
			}
			if(a==b) {
				System.out.println(1);
				return;
			}
			
			System.out.println((n-2)*(b-a)+1);
			
	    }
				
	}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4 4 6

Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The output of the code execution would be:

10

END-OF-OUTPUT

Explanation:

The input given is:

4 4 6

The code takes three long values n, a, and b as input. 

The first if condition checks if a is greater than b or if n is equal to 1 and a is not equal to b. In this case, the code returns 0 as the output.

The second if condition checks if a is equal to b. In this case, the code returns 1 as the output.

The third if condition checks if a is less than b. In this case, the code calculates the number of integers between a and b (inclusive) and multiplies it by (b-a). The result is added to 1 to get the final output.

Therefore, the output of the code execution is 10.
