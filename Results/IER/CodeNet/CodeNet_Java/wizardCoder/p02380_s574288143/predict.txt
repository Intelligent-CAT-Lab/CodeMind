The variable `a`, `b` and `c` are initialized with 4, 3 and 90, respectively.

The first line of code calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height using the formula:

area = 0.5 * base * height

So, the area of the triangle with base 4 and height 3 is:

area = 0.5 * 4 * 3 = 6

The second line of code calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle given the legs using the formula:

hypotenuse = sqrt(leg1^2 + leg2^2)

So, the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle with legs 4 and 3 is:

hypotenuse = sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5

The third line of code calculates the length of the side of a right-angled triangle given the angle and the hypotenuse using the formula:

side = hypotenuse * sin(angle)

So, the length of the side of the triangle with angle 90 and hypotenuse 5 is:

side = 5 * sin(90) = 5 * 1 = 5

Therefore, the output of code execution is:

6.0
5.0
5.0
