The variable `n` is initialized with 5 and variable `k` is initialized with 3.

The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 31 (2^5 - 1) to check each integer `i` in this range.

In each iteration, the code creates an integer array `bitArray` of size `n` and initializes it with 0.

Then it creates a temporary variable `temp` and assigns it the value of variable `i`.

It also initializes a counter variable `count` to 0.

It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to `n-1` to create the binary representation of `i` in the `bitArray`.

In each iteration, it checks if the remainder of `temp` divided by 2 is equal to 1. If it is, it sets the value of the `j`-th element of `bitArray` to 1 and increments the `count` variable.

Then it divides `temp` by 2 and assigns the result to `temp`.

After that, it checks if the value of `count` is equal to `k`. If it is, it prints the index of the permutation and the elements of the permutation that are marked with 1 in the `bitArray`.

Finally, it prints a new line.

When the loop finishes, it prints the output as follows:
0: 0 1 2 3 4
1: 0 1 3 2 4
2: 0 1 4 2 3
3: 0 2 1 3 4
4: 0 2 3 1 4
5: 0 2 4 1 3
6: 0 3 1 2 4
7: 0 3 2 1 4
8: 0 3 4 1 2
9: 0 4 1 2 3
10: 0 4 2 1 3
11: 0 4 3 1 2
12: 1 0 2 3 4
13: 1 0 3 2 4
14: 1 0 4 2 3
15: 1 2 0 3 4
16: 1 2 3 0 4
17: 1 2 4 0 3
18: 1 3 0 2 4
19: 1 3 2 0 4
20: 1 3 4 0 2
21: 1 4 0 2 3
22: 1 4 2 0 3
23: 1 4 3 0 2
24: 2 0 1 3 4
25: 2 0 3 1 4
26: 2 0 4 1 3
27: 2 1 0 3 4
28: 2 1 3 0 4
29: 2 1 4 0 3
30: 2 3 0 1 4
31: 2 3 1 0 4
