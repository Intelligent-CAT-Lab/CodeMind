Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int l;
		for(l=1; l<N; l++){
			N -= l;
		}
		if(N!= l){
			System.out.println("No");
			System.out.flush();
			return;
		}
		System.out.println("Yes");
		System.out.println(l+1);
		int[][] answer = new int[l+1][l];
		int Index = 1;
		for(int i=0; i<=l; i++){
		StringBuilder string = new StringBuilder();
			string.append(l);
			int j=0;
			for(; j<i; j++){
				string.append(" ");
				string.append(answer[j][i-1]);
			}
			for(; j<l; j++){
				string.append(" ");
				string.append(answer[i][j]=Index++);
			}
			System.out.println(string.toString());
		}
		System.out.flush();
		return;
	}
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `N` is initialized with 3.

The for loop starts with `l=1` and goes up to `N-1`. In each iteration, `N` is decremented by `l`.

After the loop, `N` is compared with `l`. If they are not equal, it means that `N` is not a sum of consecutive integers from 1 to `N`. So, the program prints "No" and exits.

If `N` is equal to `l`, it means that `N` is a sum of consecutive integers from 1 to `N`. So, the program prints "Yes" and `l+1` as the output.

The program then creates a 2D array `answer` of size `l+1` x `l`. The variable `Index` is initialized with 1.

The program then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to `l`. In each iteration, it creates a `StringBuilder` object `string` and appends the value of `l` to it. It then enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to `i-1`. In each iteration, it appends a space and the value of `answer[j][i-1]` to `string`. It then enters another for loop that iterates from `i` to `l-1`. In each iteration, it appends a space and the value of `answer[i][j]=Index++` to `string`. It then prints `string` as output.

The output of code execution is:
Yes
4
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4
