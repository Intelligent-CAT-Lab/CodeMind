Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    static TreeSet<Integer> all = new TreeSet<>();
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextLine().charAt(0) - '0';
		int[] base = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		    base[i] = i + 1;
		}
		make(0, 0, base, n);
		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
		for (int x : all) {
		    sb.append(toString(x, n)).append("\n");
		}
		System.out.print(sb);
	}
	
	static void make(int value, int mask, int[] base, int size) {
	    if (mask == (1 << size) - 1) {
	        all.add(value);
	        return;
	    }
	    value *= 10;
	    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
	        if ((mask & (1 << i))!= 0) {
	            continue;
	        }
	        make(value + base[i], mask | (1 << i), base, size);
	    }
	}
	
	static char[] toString(int x, int size) {
	    char[] ans = new char[size * 2 - 1];
	    Arrays.fill(ans,'');
	    int idx = ans.length - 1;
	    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
	        ans[idx] = (char)(x % 10 + '0');
	        x /= 10;
	        idx -= 2;
	    }
	    return ans;
	}
