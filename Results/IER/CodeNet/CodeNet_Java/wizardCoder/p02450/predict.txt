The variable `n` is initialized with 2.

The for loop iterates from 1 to 2 and the value of `i` is passed to the variable `str2` and concatenated with the variable `str`. The final value of `str` is "12".

The function `permutation` is called with the arguments "12" and an empty string `ans`.

The base case is reached when the length of the string `q` is less than or equal to 1. In this case, the function prints the string `ans` followed by a space and the string `q`. The final output is "12".

The general case is reached when the length of the string `q` is greater than 1. In this case, the function calls itself recursively with the arguments `q.substring(0, i) + q.substring(i + 1)` and `ans + q.charAt(i)`. The first argument is the substring of `q` that excludes the character at index `i`, and the second argument is the string `ans` followed by a space and the character at index `i`.

The function is called twice, once with the arguments "12" and "1" and once with the arguments "12" and "1 2". The final output is "12 1 2 12".
