The variable `low` is initialized with 1, `high` is initialized with 3^32, and `n` is initialized with the input value.

The `main` method initializes `n` with the input value and calls the `dfs` method with the initial values of `pos` and `pace`.

The `dfs` method takes two parameters, `pos` and `pace`. `pos` is the current position of the pointer and `pace` is the current pace of the pointer.

The method first checks if the current position is greater than the input value `n`. If it is, it returns 0.

Then, it checks if the current pace is less than the value of `high`. If it is, it calculates the next pace as 3 times the current pace and the next position as the sum of the current position and the next pace.

If the next position is equal to the input value `n` and the next pace is either 1 or 3, it returns 1.

Otherwise, it calls the `dfs` method recursively with the next position and the next pace. If the result is not 0, it returns 1 plus the result.

If the current pace is greater than the value of `low`, it calculates the next pace as the current pace divided by 3 and the next position as the sum of the current position and the next pace.

If the next position is equal to the input value `n` and the next pace is either 1 or 3, it returns 1.

Otherwise, it calls the `dfs` method recursively with the next position and the next pace. If the result is not 0, it returns 1 plus the result.

If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 0.
