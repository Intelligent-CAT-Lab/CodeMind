The variable `n` is initialized with "1222".
The variable `a` is initialized with the first digit of `n`, which is 1.
The variable `b` is initialized with the second digit of `n`, which is 2.
The variable `c` is initialized with the third digit of `n`, which is 2.
The variable `d` is initialized with the fourth digit of `n`, which is 2.

The first if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1+2+2+2=7" and returns.

The second if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` minus `d` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1+2+2-2=7" and returns.

The third if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `d` minus `c` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1+2-2+2=7" and returns.

The fourth if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` minus `d` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1+2-2-2=7" and returns.

The fifth if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `d` minus `c` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1-2+2+2=7" and returns.

The sixth if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` minus `d` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1-2+2-2=7" and returns.

The seventh if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `d` minus `c` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1-2-2+2=7" and returns.

The eighth if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` minus `d` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1-2-2-2=7" and returns.

Therefore, the output of code execution is:
1+2+2+2=7
