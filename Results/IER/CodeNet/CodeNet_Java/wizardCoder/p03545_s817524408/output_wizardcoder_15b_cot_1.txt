Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84

Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String n = sc.next();
        int a = Integer.parseInt(n.substring(0,1));
        int b = Integer.parseInt(n.substring(1,2));
        int c = Integer.parseInt(n.substring(2,3));
        int d = Integer.parseInt(n.substring(3,4));
        if(a+b+c+d==7) {
            System.out.println(a+"+"+b+"+"+c+"+"+d+"=7");
            return;
        }
        if(a+b+c-d==7) {
            System.out.println(a+"+"+b+"+"+c+"-"+d+"=7");
            return;
        }
        if(a+b-c+d==7) {
            System.out.println(a+"+"+b+"-"+c+"+"+d+"=7");
            return;
        }
        if(a-b+c+d==7) {
            System.out.println(a+"-"+b+"+"+c+"+"+d+"=7");
            return;
        }
        if(a+b-c-d==7) {
            System.out.println(a+"+"+b+"-"+c+"-"+d+"=7");
            return;
        }
        if(a-b+c-d==7) {
            System.out.println(a+"-"+b+"+"+c+"-"+d+"=7");
            return;
        }
        if(a-b-c+d==7) {
            System.out.println(a+"-"+b+"-"+c+"+"+d+"=7");
            return;
        }
        if(a-b-c-d==7) {
            System.out.println(a+"-"+b+"-"+c+"-"+d+"=7");
            return;
        }
        
    }
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1222

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `n` is initialized with "1222".
The variable `a` is initialized with the first digit of `n`, which is 1.
The variable `b` is initialized with the second digit of `n`, which is 2.
The variable `c` is initialized with the third digit of `n`, which is 2.
The variable `d` is initialized with the fourth digit of `n`, which is 2.

The first if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1+2+2+2=7" and returns.

The second if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` minus `d` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1+2+2-2=7" and returns.

The third if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `d` minus `c` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1+2-2+2=7" and returns.

The fourth if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` minus `d` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1+2-2-2=7" and returns.

The fifth if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `d` minus `c` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1-2+2+2=7" and returns.

The sixth if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` minus `d` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1-2+2-2=7" and returns.

The seventh if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `d` minus `c` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1-2-2+2=7" and returns.

The eighth if statement checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` minus `d` is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "1-2-2-2=7" and returns.

Therefore, the output of code execution is:
1+2+2+2=7
END-OF-OUTPUT
