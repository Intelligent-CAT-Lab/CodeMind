The variable `strz` is initialized with the input string "serval".

The variable `min` is initialized with 100.

The for loop iterates from 0 to 25, which is the number of possible keys.

In each iteration, the variable `key` is assigned the ASCII code of the current key, which is the lowercase letter 'a' plus the current iteration index.

The variable `cnt` is initialized with 0.

The variable `str` is initialized with a copy of the input string `strz`.

The while loop runs until the input string `str` is reduced to a single character.

The boolean variable `flag` is initialized with false.

The for loop iterates over the characters of the input string `str` and checks if any character is not equal to the current key. If it finds a non-matching character, it sets `flag` to true and breaks out of the loop.

If `flag` is false, it means that the input string `str` contains only the current key. It prints the key and the count of the number of times it appears in the input string `strz`. If the count is less than `min`, it updates `min` with the new count.

The while loop continues to reduce the input string `str` by one character at a time until it is reduced to a single character.

The variable `next` is initialized with a new array of length `str.length - 1`.

The for loop iterates over the characters of the input string `str` and assigns the current key to the first occurrence of the key, and the previous key to the remaining occurrences of the key.

The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1.

If the length of the `next` array is 1, it means that the input string `str` is reduced to a single character, which is the key. The while loop breaks out of the loop.

The variable `str` is assigned the `next` array.

The while loop continues to reduce the input string `str` by one character at a time until it is reduced to a single character.
