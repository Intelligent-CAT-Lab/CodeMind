Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	static long sum = 0;

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long n = sc.nextLong();
		long x = sc.nextLong();
		
		long a = Math.max(x, n-x);
		long b = Math.min(x, n-x);

		sum = a + b;
		while(true){
			long c = refrect(a, b);
			if(c==0) break;
			a = b;
			b = c;
		}

		System.out.println(sum);
	}

	static long refrect(long a, long b){
		long rest = a%b;
		long times = a/b;

		sum += b*times*2;
		if(rest==0) sum -= b;

		return rest;
	}
}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `n` is initialized with 5 and variable `x` is initialized with 2.

The variable `a` is initialized with the maximum value between `x` and `n-x`.

The variable `b` is initialized with the minimum value between `x` and `n-x`.

The variable `sum` is initialized with the sum of `a` and `b`.

The while loop is executed until the condition `c==0` is met.

In each iteration of the while loop, the function `refrect` is called with the values of `a` and `b`.

The function `refrect` calculates the remainder of `a` divided by `b` and the quotient of `a` divided by `b`.

The function `refrect` updates the value of `sum` by adding `b` multiplied by the quotient of `a` divided by `b` multiplied by 2.

If the remainder of `a` divided by `b` is 0, the function `refrect` subtracts `b` from `sum`.

The function `refrect` returns the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.

The value of `a` is updated with the value of `b` and the value of `b` is updated with the value returned by the function `refrect`.

When the while loop finishes, the value of `sum` is printed as output.

The output of code execution is:
12
END-OF-OUTPUT
