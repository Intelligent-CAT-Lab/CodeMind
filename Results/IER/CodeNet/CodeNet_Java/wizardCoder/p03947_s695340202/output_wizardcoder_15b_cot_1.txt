Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.InputStream;

/**

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		InputStream inputStream = System.in;
		OutputStream outputStream = System.out;
		FastScanner in = new FastScanner(inputStream);
		PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(outputStream);
		TaskC solver = new TaskC();
		solver.solve(1, in, out);
		out.close();
	}

	static class TaskC {
		public void solve(int testNumber, FastScanner in, PrintWriter out) {
			char[] s = in.next().toCharArray();
			int ans = 0;
			for (int i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {
				if (s[i]!= s[i - 1]) {
					++ans;
				}
			}
			out.println(ans);
		}

	}

	static class FastScanner {
		private BufferedReader in;
		private StringTokenizer st;

		public FastScanner(InputStream stream) {
			in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(stream));
		}

		public String next() {
			while (st == null ||!st.hasMoreTokens()) {
				try {
					st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());
				} catch (IOException e) {
					throw new RuntimeException(e);
				}
			}
			return st.nextToken();
		}

	}
}


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
BBBWW

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `s` is initialized with "BBBWW".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each character `s[i]` in this range.
In each iteration, it checks if the current character `s[i]` is different from the previous character `s[i-1]`. If it is, it increments the value of variable `ans`.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `ans` as output, which is 2.

The output of code execution is:
2
END-OF-OUTPUT
