### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT

Consider the following code: 
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int k = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());

        List<Pair> l = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            l.add(new Pair(1, i));
        }

        int now = (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2;
        if (now < k) {
            System.out.println("-1");
            return;
        }

        int from = 2;
        int to = 3;

        while (now > k) {
            l.add(new Pair(from, to));
            now--;
            if (to == n) {
                from++;
                to = from + 1;
            } else {
                to++;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(l.size());
        for (Pair p : l) {
            System.out.println(p.u + " " + p.v);
        }
    }

    public static class Pair {
        int u;
        int v;

        public Pair(int u, int v) {
            this.u = u;
            this.v = v;
        }
    }
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5 3

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `n` is initialized with 5 and variable `k` is initialized with 3.

The list `l` is initialized with pairs of numbers from 2 to 5.

The variable `now` is initialized with the sum of the first `n-2` numbers, which is 10.

The variable `from` is initialized with 2 and the variable `to` is initialized with 3.

The while loop is executed until the value of `now` is less than `k`.

In each iteration of the while loop, a new pair of numbers is added to the list `l`. The value of `now` is decremented by 1. If the value of `to` is equal to `n`, the value of `from` is incremented by 1 and the value of `to` is set to `from+1`. Otherwise, the value of `to` is incremented by 1.

After the while loop finishes, the size of the list `l` is printed as output, which is 3.

Finally, the pairs of numbers in the list `l` are printed as output, which are:
2 3
3 4
4 5

The output of code execution is:
3
2 3
3 4
4 5
END-OF-OUTPUT
