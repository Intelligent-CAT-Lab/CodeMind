Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
<<Answer>>
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    static HashMap<Integer, HashMap<Integer, Long>> dp = new HashMap<>();
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        long total = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i * Math.pow(2, k - 1) <= n; i++) {
            total += search(i, k - 1, n);
        } 
        System.out.println(total);
    }
    
    static long search(int num, int count, int max) {
        if (count == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (dp.containsKey(num)) {
            if (dp.get(num).containsKey(count)) {
                return dp.get(num).get(count);
            }
        }
        long total = 0;
        for (int i = 2; num * i * Math.pow(2, count - 1) <= max; i++) {
            total += search(num * i, count - 1, max);
        }
        if (dp.containsKey(num)) {
            dp.get(num).put(count, total);
        } else {
            HashMap<Integer, Long> map = new HashMap<>();
            map.put(count, total);
            dp.put(num, map);
        }
        return total;
    }
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
6 3

Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The output of the code execution would be:

10

END-OF-OUTPUT

Explanation:

The input is 6 and 3. The code will generate all the numbers from 1 to 6 that can be formed by multiplying 2 with any number from 1 to 3. The numbers that can be formed are 2, 4, 6. The sum of these numbers is 12. The code will then generate all the numbers from 1 to 12 that can be formed by multiplying 2 with any number from 1 to 2. The numbers that can be formed are 2, 4, 8, 10, 12. The sum of these numbers is 30. The code will then generate all the numbers from 1 to 30 that can be formed by multiplying 2 with any number from 1 to 1. The numbers that can be formed
