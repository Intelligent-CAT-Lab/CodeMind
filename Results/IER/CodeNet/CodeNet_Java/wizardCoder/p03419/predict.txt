The variable `n` and `m` are initialized with 2 and 2, respectively.
The if statement checks if either `n` or `m` is equal to 2. If it is, it prints 0 and returns.
If neither `n` nor `m` is equal to 2, it calculates the value of variable `ans` as follows:
`ans` = `Math.max(1, n - 2)` * `Math.max(1, m - 2)`
The `Math.max()` function returns the maximum of its two arguments.
In this case, `ans` is calculated as `Math.max(1, 0)` * `Math.max(1, 0)` = 0.
Therefore, the output of code execution is:
0
