The variable `n` is initialized with 3. And variable `k` is initialized with 2.
The code enters a if statement and checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, it calculates the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and prints the result.
If `k` is less than `n`, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to `k`. In each iteration, it calculates the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)` and multiplies it with the binomial coefficient of `n+n-1` and `n-1-i` using the formula `nCr = n!
