Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Scanner;


public class Main {

	private static Scanner sc;
	private static Printer pr;

	private static void solve() {
		int n1 = sc.nextInt();
		int n2 = sc.nextInt();
		int n3 = sc.nextInt();
		int n4 = sc.nextInt();

		int[] cnt = new int[10];
		cnt[n1]++;
		cnt[n2]++;
		cnt[n3]++;
		cnt[n4]++;
		
		if (cnt[1] == 1 && cnt[9] == 1 && cnt[7] == 1 && cnt[4] == 1) {
			pr.println("YES");
		} else {
			pr.println("NO");
		}
	}

	// ---------------------------------------------------
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		pr = new Printer(System.out);
			
		solve();
			
		pr.close();
		sc.close();
	}

	static class Printer extends PrintWriter {
		Printer(OutputStream out) {
			super(out);
		}
	}
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 7 9 4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `n1`, `n2`, `n3` and `n4` are initialized with 1, 7, 9 and 4, respectively.

The array `cnt` is initialized with 10 elements, where each element is initialized with 0.

The value of `n1` is incremented by 1 in the `cnt` array.

The value of `n2` is incremented by 1 in the `cnt` array.

The value of `n3` is incremented by 1 in the `cnt` array.

The value of `n4` is incremented by 1 in the `cnt` array.

The condition `cnt[1] == 1 && cnt[9] == 1 && cnt[7] == 1 && cnt[4] == 1` is checked.

If the condition is true, then the output is "YES".

If the condition is false, then the output is "NO".

The output of code execution is:
NO
END-OF-OUTPUT
