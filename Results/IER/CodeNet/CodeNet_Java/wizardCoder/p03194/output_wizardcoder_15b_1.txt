Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
<<Answer>>
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;

class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long n = sc.nextLong();
		long p = sc.nextLong();
		if (n == 1) {
			System.out.println(p);
			return;
		}
		long res = 1;
		for (int i = 2; Math.pow(i, n) <= p; i++) {
			if (p % Math.pow(i, n) == 0) res = i;
		}
		System.out.println(res);
	}
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 24

Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The output of the code execution would be:

2

END-OF-OUTPUT

Explanation:

The given code is to find the largest power of a number that is less than or equal to a given number. The input is two numbers n and p. The code reads the input values and checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, then the code prints the value of p and returns. If n is not equal to 1, then the code initializes a variable res to 1. It then iterates from 2 to the square root of p and checks if p is divisible by i^n. If it is, then the code updates the value of res to i. Finally, the code prints the value of res. In this case, the input values are 3 and 24. The largest power of a number that is less than or equal to 24 is 2^3, which is 8. Therefore
