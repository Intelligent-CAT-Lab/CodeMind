Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;

class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long n = sc.nextLong();
		long p = sc.nextLong();
		if (n == 1) {
			System.out.println(p);
			return;
		}
		long res = 1;
		for (int i = 2; Math.pow(i, n) <= p; i++) {
			if (p % Math.pow(i, n) == 0) res = i;
		}
		System.out.println(res);
	}
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 24

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `n` is initialized with 3 and variable `p` is initialized with 24.
The if statement checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of `p` and returns from the function.
If `n` is not equal to 1, it initializes the variable `res` with 1.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of `p`.
In each iteration, it checks if `p` is divisible by `i^n`. If it is, it updates the value of `res` with `i`.
When the loop finishes, it prints the final value of `res` as output, which is 2.

The output of code execution is:
2
