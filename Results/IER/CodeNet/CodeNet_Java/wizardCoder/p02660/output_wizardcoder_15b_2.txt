Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

Consider the following code: 

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        long n = Long.parseLong(scan.next());
        scan.close();

        if (n == 1) {
            System.out.println(0);
            return;
        }

        Map<Long, Integer> pMap = new HashMap<Long, Integer>();
        for (long i = 2; i < Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
            int count = 0;
            while (n % i == 0) {
                count++;
                n /= i;
            }
            if (count > 0) {
                pMap.put(i, count);
            }
        }
        if (n!= 1) {
            pMap.put(n, 1);
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (int pCount : pMap.values()) {
            int i = 1;
            while (pCount >= i) {
                pCount -= i;
                ans++;
                i++;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(ans);
    }

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
24

Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The output of the code execution would be:

12

END-OF-OUTPUT

Explanation:

The code takes an input of a long integer n. If n is equal to 1, the code returns 0 as the output. Otherwise, it creates a HashMap to store the prime factors of n. It then iterates through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of n. For each number i, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it divides n by i and increments the count of i in the HashMap. If the count of i is greater than 0, it means i is a prime factor of n.

After the HashMap is created, the code iterates through the values of the HashMap and counts the number of prime factors of n. It does this by subtracting 1 from the count of each prime factor and incrementing the answer by 1.

Finally, the code
