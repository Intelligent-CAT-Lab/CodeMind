The variable `t` is initialized with the input string "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple."

The first `replace` method replaces all occurrences of "apple" with "\n" in the string `t`. This is done to remove the word "apple" from the string.

The second `replace` method replaces all occurrences of "\n" with "apple" in the string `t`. This is done to replace the removed word "apple" with "peach".

The third `replace` method replaces all occurrences of "peach" with "\n" in the string `t`. This is done to replace the word "peach" with the original word "apple".

The final output of the code execution is:
the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.
