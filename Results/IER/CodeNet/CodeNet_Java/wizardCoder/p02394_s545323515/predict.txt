The variable `W`, `H`, `x`, `y` and `r` are initialized with 5, 4, 2, 2 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if the circle with center at `(x,y)` and radius `r` is within the rectangle with dimensions `W` and `H`.
The condition is met when the circle is completely inside the rectangle.
Therefore, the output of code execution is:
Yes
