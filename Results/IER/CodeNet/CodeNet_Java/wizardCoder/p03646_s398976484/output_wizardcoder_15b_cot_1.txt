Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long K = sc.nextLong();
		long x = K % 50, y = K /50;
		long[] a = new long[50];
		for(int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
			a[i] = i + y;
			if(i >= 50 - x)
				a[i]++;
		}
		System.out.println(50);
		for(int i = 0; i < 50; i++)
			System.out.print(a[i] + " ");
	}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
0

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `K` is initialized with 0.
The variable `x` is calculated as `K % 50` which is 0.
The variable `y` is calculated as `K / 50` which is 0.
An array `a` of size 50 is created and initialized with values from 0 to 49.
The values of `a` are calculated as follows:
- `a[0]` = 0 + 0 = 0
- `a[1]` = 1 + 0 = 1
- `a[2]` = 2 + 0 = 2
- `a[3]` = 3 + 0 = 3
- `a[4]` = 4 + 0 = 4
- `a[5]` = 5 + 0 = 5
- `a[6]` = 6 + 0 = 6
- `a[7]` = 7 + 0 = 7
- `a[8]` = 8 + 0 = 8
- `a[9]` = 9 + 0 = 9
- `a[10]` = 10 + 0 = 10
- `a[11]` = 11 + 0 = 11
- `a[12]` = 12 + 0 = 12
- `a[13]` = 13 + 0 = 13
- `a[14]` = 14 + 0 = 14
- `a[15]` = 15 + 0 = 15
- `a[16]` = 16 + 0 = 16
- `a[17]` = 17 + 0 = 17
- `a[18]` = 18 + 0 = 18
- `a[19]` = 19 + 0 = 19
- `a[20]` = 20 + 0 = 20
- `a[21]` = 21 + 0 = 21
- `a[22]` = 22 + 0 = 22
- `a[23]` = 23 + 0 = 23
- `a[24]` = 24 + 0 = 24
- `a[25]` = 25 + 0 = 25
- `a[26]` = 26 + 0 = 26
- `a[27]` = 27 + 0 = 27
- `a[28]` = 28 + 0 = 28
- `a[29]` = 29 + 0 = 29
- `a[30]` = 30 + 0 = 30
- `a[31]` = 31 + 0 = 31
- `a[32]` = 32 + 0 = 32
- `a[33]` = 33 + 0 = 33
- `a[34]` = 34 + 0 = 34
- `a[35]` = 35 + 0 = 35
- `a[36]` = 36 + 0 = 36
- `a[37]` = 37 + 0 = 37
- `a[38]` = 38 + 0 = 38
- `a[39]` = 39 + 0 = 39
- `a[40]` = 40 + 0 = 40
- `a[41]` = 41 + 0 = 41
- `a[42]` = 42 + 0 = 42
- `a[43]` = 43 + 0 = 43
- `a[44]` = 44 + 0 = 44
- `a[45]` = 45 + 0 = 45
- `a[46]` = 46 + 0 = 46
- `a[47]` = 47 + 0 = 47
- `a[48]` = 48 + 0 = 48
- `a[49]` = 49 + 0 = 49

The value of `a` is printed as output, which is:
50 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49

The output of code execution is:
50 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49
