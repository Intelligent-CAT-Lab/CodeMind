The variable `h`, `w`, `s` and `t` are initialized with 4, 5, 2 and 3, respectively.

The first condition checks if the product of `h` and `w` is odd. Since `h` is 4 and `w` is 5, the product is 20. Therefore, the condition is true.

The second condition checks if the sum of `s` multiplied by `w` and `t` is odd. Since `s` is 2 and `t` is 3, the sum is 5. Therefore, the condition is true.

Therefore, the output of code execution is:
No
