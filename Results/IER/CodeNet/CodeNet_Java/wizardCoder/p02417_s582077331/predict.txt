The variable `low_az` is initialized with all lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The variable `up_az` is initialized with all uppercase letters of the English alphabet. The variable `str` is initialized with an empty string. The variable `cnt` is initialized with an array of size 26, where each element is initialized with 0.

The program reads input from the user using a `Scanner` object. It reads each line of input and stores it in the variable `str`. It then iterates over each character of the string and checks if it is a lowercase or uppercase letter. If it is, it increments the corresponding element of the `cnt` array.

After all input has been read, the program prints the count of each letter in the English alphabet. The output of the program is:

a : 1
b : 0
c : 0
d : 0
e : 1
f : 0
g : 0
h : 0
i : 0
j : 0
k : 0
l : 0
m : 0
n : 0
o : 0
p : 0
q : 0
r : 0
s : 0
t : 0
u : 0
v : 0
w : 0
x : 0
y : 0
z : 0
