Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		//List<String> list= new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList(s.split("")));
		//List<Integer> list=new ArrayList<Integer>();
		//Integer[] array = new Integer[m];
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int a =sumDigits(n);
		if(n%a==0)
			System.out.println("Yes");
		else
			System.out.println("No");
	}

	private static int sumDigits(int n) {
		int sum = 0;
		//自然数の各桁の和を計算
		while (n!= 0) {
			//sumDigitsは単独ではloopしないので、while loopを使う。
			sum += n % 10;
			//再右端の桁を得るために%10を利用する。
			n /= 10;
			//再右端の桁を取り除くためにn/=10を利用する。
		}
		return sum;//合計を返す
	}
}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
12

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `n` is initialized with 12.
The method `sumDigits` is called with `n` as input.
The method `sumDigits` calculates the sum of the digits of `n` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `n` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it returns the calculated variable `sum`.
The variable `a` is initialized with the value returned by the method `sumDigits` with `n` as input.
The condition `n%a==0` is checked. Since 12 is divisible by 3, the condition is true and the output is "Yes".

The output of code execution is:
Yes
END-OF-OUTPUT
