The variable `n` and `k` are initialized with 3 and 2, respectively.

The `solve` function is called with `n` and `k` as arguments.

The `wayNums` array is initialized with 3 dimensions, where `wayNums[i][j][p]` represents the number of ways to choose `i` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j` and the number of odd numbers is `p`.

The base case is `wayNums[0][0][0] = 1`, since there is only one way to choose no pairs and no odd numbers.

The function then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of `i`, `j`, and `p`. For each value of `i`, `j`, and `p`, the function calculates the number of ways to choose `i` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j` and the number of odd numbers is `p`.

The function uses the `getWayNum` function to get the number of ways to choose `i` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j`. This is done by adding the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j-2*j` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]).

The function then multiplies this value by `2*j+1` and `j+1` (since we have added two pairs of numbers to the range [1, n]), and adds it to the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-1` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j`. This is done by adding the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-1` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j-2*j` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]).

The function then multiplies this value by `j-1` and `j-1` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]), and adds it to the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-2` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j`. This is done by adding the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-2` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j-2*j` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]).

The function then multiplies this value by `j-2` and `j-2` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]), and adds it to the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-3` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j`. This is done by adding the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-3` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j-2*j` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]).

The function then multiplies this value by `j-3` and `j-3` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]), and adds it to the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-4` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j`. This is done by adding the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-4` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j-2*j` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]).

The function then multiplies this value by `j-4` and `j-4` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]), and adds it to the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-5` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j`. This is done by adding the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-5` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j-2*j` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]).

The function then multiplies this value by `j-5` and `j-5` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]), and adds it to the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-6` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j`. This is done by adding the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-6` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j-2*j` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]).

The function then multiplies this value by `j-6` and `j-6` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]), and adds it to the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-7` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j`. This is done by adding the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-7` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j-2*j` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]).

The function then multiplies this value by `j-7` and `j-7` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]), and adds it to the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-8` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j`. This is done by adding the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-8` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j-2*j` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]).

The function then multiplies this value by `j-8` and `j-8` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]), and adds it to the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-9` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j`. This is done by adding the number of ways to choose `i-1` pairs of numbers from the range [1, n] such that the sum of the numbers is `j-9` and the number of odd numbers is `p-2*j-2*j` (since we have removed two pairs of numbers from the range [1, n]).
