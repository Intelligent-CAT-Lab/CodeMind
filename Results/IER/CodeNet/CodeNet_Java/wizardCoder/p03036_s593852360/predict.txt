The variable `r`, `d` and `x` are initialized with 2, 10 and 20, respectively.

The for loop iterates from 0 to 9 and in each iteration, the value of variable `x` is updated as follows:

`x = r * x - d`

where `r` is 2, `d` is 10, and `x` is the previous value of `x`.

The first iteration of the loop sets `x` to 20, the second iteration sets `x` to 18, the third iteration sets `x` to 16, and so on.

The output of the code execution is:

20
18
16
14
12
10
8
6
4
2
0
