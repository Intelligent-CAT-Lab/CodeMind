The variable `k` is initialized with 3 and `n` is initialized with 2.

The first if statement is executed because `k` is even. Therefore, `k/2` is printed and then `k` is printed `n-1` times. The output is:
1 3

The second if statement is executed because `k` is odd. Therefore, `k+1` is divided by 2 and the result is stored in a list called `res`. The list contains `n` elements, each of which is equal to `k/2`.

The variable `cnt` is initialized with `n/2`.

The for loop iterates `cnt` times and removes the last element of the list `res` if it is greater than 1. If it is not greater than 1, it removes the last element of the list `res`.

The for loop then iterates `n` times and prints the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces. The output is:
1 1

Therefore, the output of code execution is:
1 1
