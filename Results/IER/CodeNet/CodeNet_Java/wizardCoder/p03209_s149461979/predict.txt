The variable `n` is initialized with 2 and variable `x` is initialized with 7.
The function `count` is called with `n` and `x` as arguments.
The function `count` checks if `n` is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 1.
If `x` is equal to 1, it returns 0.
If the value of `x` is already present in the cache, it returns the value of `x` from the cache.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of `layers_n_1` as `(1L << (n + 1)) - 3L`.
Then it initializes the variable `ans` to 0.
If `x` is greater than `2L + layers_n_1`, it calculates the value of `ans` as `1L + count(n - 1, x - layers_n_1 - 2L, cache) + count(n - 1, layers_n_1, cache)`.
If `x` is equal to `2L + layers_n_1`, it calculates the value of `ans` as `1L + count(n - 1, layers_n_1, cache)`.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of `ans` as `count(n - 1, x - 1L, cache)`.
Finally, it stores the value of `ans` in the cache and returns it.
