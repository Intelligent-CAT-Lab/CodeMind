Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int X = sc.nextInt();
		int Y = sc.nextInt();

		int sum=0;
		boolean judge=false;
		int a=0;
		int b=0;
		int c=0;

		for (int i=0; i<X+1; i++) {
			for (int k=0; k<X-i+1; k++) {
				sum = 10000*i + 5000*k + 1000*(X-i-k);
				if (sum==Y) {
					judge = true;
					a=i;
					b=k;
					c=X-i-k;
					break;
				}
			}
		}
		if (judge) {
			System.out.print(a);
			System.out.print(" ");
			System.out.print(b);
			System.out.print(" ");
			System.out.print(c);

		} else {
			System.out.println("-1 -1 -1");
		}

	}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
9 45000

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `X` and `Y` are initialized with 9 and 45000, respectively.

The variable `sum` is initialized with 0.

The variable `judge` is initialized with false.

The variables `a`, `b` and `c` are initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates from 0 to X+1.

The nested for loop iterates from 0 to X-i+1.

The variable `sum` is calculated as 10000*i + 5000*k + 1000*(X-i-k).

If the value of `sum` is equal to `Y`, the variable `judge` is set to true and the variables `a`, `b` and `c` are assigned the values of `i`, `k` and `X-i-k`, respectively.

If the value of `judge` is true, the output is printed as `a` `b` `c`.

If the value of `judge` is false, the output is printed as `-1 -1 -1`.

The output of code execution is:
3 2 6
END-OF-OUTPUT
