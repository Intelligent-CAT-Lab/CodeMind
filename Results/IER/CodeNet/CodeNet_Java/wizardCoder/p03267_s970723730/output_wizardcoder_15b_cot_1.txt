### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84

Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int l=sc.nextInt();
        sc.close();
        int n=0, m=0;
        while(l>=(1<<n++));n--;
        StringBuilder sb =new StringBuilder();
        int sum=0;
        for(int bit=0;bit<n-1;bit++){
            sb.append((bit+1)+" "+(bit+2)+" "+0+"\n");
            m++;
                sb.append((bit+1)+" "+(bit+2)+" "+(1<<bit)+"\n");
                m++;
                if((l&(1<<bit))!=0){
                    sb.append((bit+1)+" "+n+" "+(l-sum-(1<<bit))+"\n");
                    sum+=(1<<bit);
                    m++;
                }
        }
        System.out.println(n+" "+m);
        System.out.print(sb);
    }
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `l` is initialized with 4.

The code uses a binary search algorithm to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `l`. The variable `n` is initialized with 0 and the while loop runs until `l` is less than or equal to `2^n`. In each iteration, `n` is incremented by 1.

The variable `sb` is initialized as a StringBuilder object. The variable `m` is initialized with 0.

The for loop runs from 0 to `n-2`. In each iteration, the code appends three strings to `sb`. The first string is the edge between the `bit`th and `(bit+1)`th vertex, with weight 0. The second string is the edge between the `bit`th and `(bit+1)`th vertex, with weight `2^bit`. The third string is the edge between the `bit`th and `n`th vertex, with weight `l-sum-(2^bit)`. The variable `m` is incremented by 3.

The code then prints the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the contents of `sb`.

The output of code execution is:
3 11
1 2 0
1 3 2
2 3 2
