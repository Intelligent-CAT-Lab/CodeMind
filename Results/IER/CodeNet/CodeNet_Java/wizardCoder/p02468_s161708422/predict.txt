The variable `m` is initialized with 2 and `n` is initialized with 3.
The `modPow` method is called with `m` and `n` as arguments.
The method checks if `n` is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 1.
If `n` is even, it calls itself recursively with `m * m % mod` and `n / 2` as arguments.
If `n` is odd, it calls itself recursively with `m * m % mod` and `(n - 1) / 2` as arguments, and multiplies the result with `m` modulo `mod`.
The final result is returned.
