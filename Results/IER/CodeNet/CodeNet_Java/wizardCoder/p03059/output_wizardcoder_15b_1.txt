Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
<<Answer>>
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int amount = 0;
      	int time = a;  
      
        for(int i = 2; time <= c + 0.5; i++){
            amount += b;
          	time = a * i;
        }
        
        System.out.println(amount);
    }
}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 5 7

Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The output of the code execution would be:

10

END-OF-OUTPUT

Explanation:

The code takes three integers as input, a, b, and c. It initializes a variable amount to 0 and a variable time to a. It then uses a for loop to calculate the amount of money earned by the customer. The loop starts from i = 2 and continues until time is greater than or equal to c + 0.5. Inside the loop, it adds b to the amount variable and updates the value of time to a * i. Finally, it prints the value of amount as the output of the code execution.
