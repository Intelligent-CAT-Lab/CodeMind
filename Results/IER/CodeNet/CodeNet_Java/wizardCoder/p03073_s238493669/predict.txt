The variable `s` is initialized with "000". The length of the string `s` is 3.

The for loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. In each iteration, the value of `pattern1` and `pattern2` are incremented by 1 if `c` is not equal to `p1` and `p2`, respectively. The value of `p1` and `p2` are then updated to the next character in the sequence.

After the loop finishes, the value of `pattern1` and `pattern2` are compared and the minimum value is printed as output.

The value of `pattern1` and `pattern2` are both 3. Therefore, the output of code execution is:

3
