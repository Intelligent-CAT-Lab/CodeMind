The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 2, 1 and 3, respectively. And variable `ans` is initialized as an empty ArrayList.

The code checks if the bit count of XOR of `a` and `b` is even or odd. If it is even, it prints "NO" and returns.

If it is odd, it prints "YES" and proceeds to solve the problem.

The `solve` method takes three arguments: `A`, `B` and `mask`. `A` and `B` are the given range, and `mask` is a binary number that represents the remaining numbers to be considered.

The method first checks if `mask` has only one bit set. If it does, it adds `A` and `B` to the `ans` ArrayList and returns.

If `mask` has more than one bit set, it finds the rightmost bit set in `mask` and sets it to 0. It then calculates `C` as the XOR of `A` and `c`. It calls itself recursively with `A`, `C`, and `mask`. It also calls itself recursively with `C` XOR `1 << div`, `B`, and `mask`.

The `debug` method is used for debugging purposes.

The `main` method creates a new instance of the `Main` class and calls its `run` method.

The `run` method creates a new instance of the `Scanner` class and reads the input values of `n`, `a` and `b`.

The `run` method then checks if the bit count of XOR of `a` and `b` is even or odd. If it is even, it prints "NO" and returns.

If it is odd, it prints "YES" and proceeds to solve the problem.
