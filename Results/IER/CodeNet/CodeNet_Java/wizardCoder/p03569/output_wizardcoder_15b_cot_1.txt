### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public void main(Scanner sc) {
        String s = sc.next();
        int length = s.length();

        int cnt = 0;
        int l = 0;
        int r = length - 1;
        while (l <= r) {
            char cl = s.charAt(l);
            char cr = s.charAt(r);

            if (cl == cr) {
                l++;
                r--;
            } else {
                if (cl == 'x') {
                    cnt++;
                    l++;
                } else if (cr == 'x') {
                    cnt++;
                    r--;
                } else {
                    cnt = -1;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(cnt);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        new Main().main(sc);
        sc.close();
    }
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
xabxa

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `s` is initialized with the input string "xabxa". The variable `length` is initialized with the length of the string `s`.

The variable `cnt` is initialized with 0. The variable `l` is initialized with 0 and the variable `r` is initialized with the index of the last character of the string `s`.

The while loop runs until `l` is greater than `r`. In each iteration, the variables `cl` and `cr` are assigned the characters at the indices `l` and `r`, respectively.

If `cl` and `cr` are equal, then `l` and `r` are incremented and decremented, respectively.

If `cl` is equal to 'x', then `cnt` is incremented and `l` is incremented.

If `cr` is equal to 'x', then `cnt` is incremented and `r` is decremented.

If `cl` and `cr` are not equal to 'x' and not equal to each other, then `cnt` is set to -1 and the loop is terminated.

When the loop finishes, the value of variable `cnt` is printed as output, which is 2.

The output of code execution is:
2
