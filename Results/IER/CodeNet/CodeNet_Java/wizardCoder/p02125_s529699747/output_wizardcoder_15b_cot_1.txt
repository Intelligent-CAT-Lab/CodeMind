Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
		
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		
		String str = br.readLine();
		int num = Integer.parseInt(str);
		
		int i;
		
		for(i = 0; i < 100; i++){
			if(num >= Math.pow(2, i)-1){
				continue;
			}else{
				break;
			}
		}
		
		System.out.println(i-1);
	}
}

### Response:
The variable `num` is initialized with 2.

The for loop is initialized with i = 0 and i < 100.

In each iteration of the loop, the condition `num >= Math.pow(2, i)-1` is checked.

Since `num` is 2, `Math.pow(2, i)` is 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8, 2^9, 2^10, 2^11, 2^12, 2^13, 2^14, 2^15, 2^16, 2^17, 2^18, 2^19, 2^20, 2^21, 2^22, 2^23, 2^24, 2^25, 2^26, 2^27, 2^28, 2^29, 2^30, 2^31, 2^32, 2^33, 2^34, 2^35, 2^36, 2^37, 2^38, 2^39, 2^40, 2^41, 2^42, 2^43, 2^44, 2^45, 2^46, 2^47, 2^48, 2^49, 2^50, 2^51, 2^52, 2^53, 2^54, 2^55, 2^56, 2^57, 2^58, 2^59, 2^60, 2^61, 2^62, 2^63, 2^64, 2^65, 2^66, 2^67, 2^68, 2^69, 2^70, 2^71, 2^72, 2^73, 2^74, 2^75, 2^76, 2^77, 2^78, 2^79, 2^80, 2^81, 2^82, 2^83, 2^84, 2^85, 2^86, 2^87, 2^88, 2^89, 2^90, 2^91, 2^92, 2^93, 2^94, 2^95, 2^96, 2^97, 2^98, 2^99, 2^100.
