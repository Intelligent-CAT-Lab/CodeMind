### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{
	public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int W = scanner.nextInt();
        int H = scanner.nextInt();
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        int y = scanner.nextInt();
        int r = scanner.nextInt();

        if (r <= x && x <= (W - r) && r <= y && y <= (H - r)) {
        	System.out.println("Yes");
        }

        else {
        	System.out.println("No");
        }
	}
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5 4 2 2 1

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `W`, `H`, `x`, `y` and `r` are initialized with 5, 4, 2, 2 and 1, respectively.

The first condition checks if the distance between the center of the circle and the point `(x,y)` is less than or equal to the radius `r`.

The distance between the center of the circle and the point `(x,y)` is given by the distance formula:

distance = sqrt((x-cx)^2 + (y-cy)^2)

where `cx` and `cy` are the coordinates of the center of the circle.

Substituting the values of `x`, `y`, `cx` and `cy` in the distance formula, we get:

distance = sqrt((2-2)^2 + (2-2)^2) = sqrt(4) = 2

Since 2 is greater than `r`, the first condition is not satisfied.

The second condition checks if the point `(x,y)` is within the boundaries of the rectangle with dimensions `W` and `H`.

The point `(x,y)` is within the boundaries of the rectangle if and only if `x` is greater than or equal to `r` and `x` is less than or equal to `W-r` and `y` is greater than or equal to `r` and `y` is less than or equal to `H-r`.

Substituting the values of `x`, `y`, `W`, `H`, `r` in the second condition, we get:

x >= r and x <= W-r and y >= r and y <= H-r

Since 2 is not greater than or equal to `r` and 2 is not less than or equal to `W-r`, the first condition is not satisfied.

Therefore, the output of code execution is "No".

The output of code execution is:
No
END-OF-OUTPUT
