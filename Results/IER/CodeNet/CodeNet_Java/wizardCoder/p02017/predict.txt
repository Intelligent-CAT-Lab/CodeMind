The variable `h`, `w`, `x`, and `y` are initialized with 3, 5, 1, and 4, respectively.

The first condition checks if the product of `h` and `w` is odd. Since `3 * 5 = 15`, the condition is not met.

The second condition checks if the sum of `x` and `y` is odd. Since `1 + 4 = 5`, the condition is met.

Therefore, the output of code execution is:
Yes
