Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	
		String str = sc.nextLine();
		
		sc.close();
		
		int size = str.length();
		
		for(int i = 1 ; i < size ; i++){
			if(str.charAt(i) == str.charAt(i-1)){
				System.out.println(i + " " + (i+1));
				System.exit(0);
			}
		}
		
		for(int i = 2 ; i < size ; i++){
			if(str.charAt(i) == str.charAt(i-2)){
				System.out.println((i-1) + " " + (i+1));
				System.exit(0);
			}
		}
		
		System.out.println(-1 + " " + -1);
	}
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
needed

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `str` is initialized with the input string "needed".
The length of the string is calculated and stored in the variable `size`.

The first for loop iterates from 1 to `size-1` and checks if the current character and the previous character are equal. If they are, it prints the index of the current character and the index of the next character and exits the program with a status code of 0.

The second for loop iterates from 2 to `size-1` and checks if the current character and the previous character are equal. If they are, it prints the index of the previous character and the index of the next character and exits the program with a status code of 0.

If none of the above conditions are met, it prints -1 -1 as output.

The output of code execution is:
1 2
END-OF-OUTPUT
