The variable `day` is initialized with 25. It enters a switch statement and checks the value of `day`.

- If `day` is equal to 25, it prints "Christmas" and breaks out of the switch statement.
- If `day` is equal to 24, it prints "Christmas Eve" and breaks out of the switch statement.
- If `day` is equal to 23, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve" and breaks out of the switch statement.
- If `day` is equal to 22, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve Eve" and breaks out of the switch statement.

Therefore, the output of code execution is:
Christmas
