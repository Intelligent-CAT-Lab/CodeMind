### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84

        BufferedReader read = new BufferedReader(in);

        String line = read.readLine();
        String [] spli = line.split(" ");
        double a = Double.parseDouble(spli[0]);
        double b = Double.parseDouble(spli[1]);
        double angle = Double.parseDouble(spli[2]);
        double rad = Math.toRadians(angle);    
        double area = 0;
        double circum = 0;
        double hight = 0;
        
        if(angle == 90){
        	area = a*b/2;
        	circum = Math.sqrt(a*a+b*b)+a+b;
        	hight = b;
        }
        else{
        	area = a*b*Math.sin(rad)/2;
            circum = a+b+Math.sqrt(a*a+b*b-2*a*b*Math.cos(rad));
            hight = b*Math.sin(rad);         
        }
        System.out.println(area);
        System.out.println(circum);
        System.out.println(hight);         
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4 3 90

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `a`, `b` and `angle` are initialized with 4, 3 and 90, respectively.

The value of `angle` is converted to radians using the `Math.toRadians()` method and stored in the variable `rad`.

The value of `rad` is used to calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula `area = a*b*sin(rad)/2`.

The value of `rad` is used to calculate the circumference of the rectangle using the formula `circum = a+b+sqrt(a^2+b^2-2ab*cos(rad))`.

The value of `rad` is used to calculate the height of the rectangle using the formula `hight = b*sin(rad)`.

The values of `area`, `circum` and `hight` are printed as output.

The output of code execution is:
6.0
7.0
3.0
