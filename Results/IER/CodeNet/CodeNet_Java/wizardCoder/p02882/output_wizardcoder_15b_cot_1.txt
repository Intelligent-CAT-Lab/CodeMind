Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * Water Bottle
 */
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
            int A = sc.nextInt();
            int B = sc.nextInt();
            int X = sc.nextInt();

            double d;
            if (X * 2 >= A * A * B) {
                double z = (double) (A * A * B - X) / A / A * 2;
                d = Math.atan(z / A) * 180 / Math.PI;
            } else {
                double z = (double) (X) / A / B * 2;
                d = Math.atan(B / z) * 180 / Math.PI;
            }

            System.out.println(d);
        }
    }

}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2 2 4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `A`, `B` and `X` are initialized with 2, 2 and 4, respectively.

The code checks if `X * 2 >= A * A * B`. If it is true, it calculates the value of `z` as `(A * A * B - X) / A / A * 2` and then calculates the angle `d` using the formula `d = atan(z / A) * 180 / pi`. If it is false, it calculates the value of `z` as `(X) / A / B * 2` and then calculates the angle `d` using the formula `d = atan(B / z) * 180 / pi`.

The output of code execution is:
180.0
