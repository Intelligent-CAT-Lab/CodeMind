Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
<<Answer>>
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        int length = s.length();

        int count =0;
        for(int i=0;i<length/2;i++){
            char a = s.charAt(i);
            char b = s.charAt(length - 1 -i );
            if(a!= b){
                count++;
            }

//            System.out.println(String.valueOf(a) + String.valueOf(b));

        }
        System.out.println(count);






    }

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
redcoder

Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The output of the code execution would be:

1

END-OF-OUTPUT

Explanation:

The code takes a string as input from the user and then counts the number of characters that are different from their corresponding characters at the opposite ends of the string. In this case, the input string is "redcoder". The length of the string is 7. 

The for loop iterates from 0 to 3, which is the half of the length of the string. In each iteration, it takes the character at the ith index and the character at the (length - 1 - i)th index. If they are not equal, it increments the count variable. 

In the first iteration, the characters at the 0th and 6th index are 'r' and 'r', which are not equal. Therefore, the count variable is incremented by 1. 

In the second iteration, the characters at the
