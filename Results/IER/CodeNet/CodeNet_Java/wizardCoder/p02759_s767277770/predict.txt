The variable `N` is initialized with 5.
The if statement checks if `N` is even or odd. Since `N` is even, the condition `N%2 == 0` is true.
The code executes the first statement of the if block, which is `System.out.println(N/2)`.
Since `N` is even, `N/2` is 2. Therefore, the output of the code execution is:
2
