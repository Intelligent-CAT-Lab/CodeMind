The variable `T` is initialized with the input string "1101". The length of the string is 4.

The variable `oneSum` is initialized with 0. The variable `indexes` is initialized with an empty ArrayList.

The for loop iterates from 0 to 3. In each iteration, it checks if the character at index `i` is '1'. If it is, it enters another for loop to find the length of the substring starting from index `i` that contains only '1's. The length is stored in the variable `length`. If the length is odd, it adds the index `i` to the ArrayList `indexes`. The variable `oneSum` is updated with the sum of the lengths of all the substrings that contain only '1's. The loop continues until all the characters in the string have been processed.

The variable `zeroSum` is initialized with the difference between the length of the string and the value of `oneSum`.

The variable `ans` is initialized with the sum of the first `zeroSum+1` numbers. This is because the first `zeroSum+1` numbers are all '0's.

The for loop iterates from 0 to `indexes.size()-1`. In each iteration, it gets the index of the substring that contains only '1's at index `i` in the ArrayList `indexes`. It calculates the number of '0's that need to be added to the sum of the first `zeroSum+1` numbers to get the sum of the first `zeroSum+1` numbers plus the sum of the first `zeroSum+1` numbers minus the sum of the first `zeroSum+1` numbers up to the index `i` plus the sum of the first `zeroSum+1` numbers up to the index `i` plus the sum of the first `zeroSum+1` numbers up to the index `i` plus
