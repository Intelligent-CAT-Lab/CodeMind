The variable `A` and `B` are initialized with "99" and "98", respectively. And variable `k` is initialized with 1.
The variable `pow` is initialized with an array of long values.

The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to `A.length() - B.length()+1` to check each substring of `A` with length `B.length()` in this range.
In each iteration, the substring of `A` is reversed and stored in `A` and the substring of `B` is reversed and stored in `B`.
