Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		FastReader sc = new FastReader();
		PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);
		String n = sc.next();
		int san = n.charAt(0) - 48;
		int ok = san * 100 + san * 10 + san;
		if (Integer.parseInt(n) <= ok) {
			out.println(ok);
		} else {
			san = san + 1;
			ok = san * 100 + san * 10 + san;
			out.println(ok);
		}

		out.flush();

	}

	static class FastReader {
		BufferedReader br;
		StringTokenizer st;

		public FastReader() {
			br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		}

		String next() {
			while (st == null ||!st.hasMoreElements()) {
				try {
					st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
				} catch (IOException e) {
					e.printStackTrace();
				}
			}
			return st.nextToken();
		}

		int nextInt() {
			return Integer.parseInt(next());
		}

		long nextLong() {
			return Long.parseLong(next());
		}

		double nextDouble() {
			return Double.parseDouble(next());
		}

		String nextLine() {
			String str = "";
			try {
				str = br.readLine();
			} catch (IOException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
			return str;
		}
	}
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
111

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `n` is initialized with "111".
The first character of the string `n` is extracted and subtracted by 48 to get the integer value of the first digit of the string.
The value of `san` is then multiplied by 100, 10 and 1 to get the value of the first three digits of the string.
The value of `ok` is then calculated by adding the values of `san` multiplied by 100, 10 and 1.
The value of `n` is then parsed as an integer and checked if it is less than or equal to `ok`.
If it is, then the value of `ok` is printed as output.
If it is not, then the value of `san` is incremented by 1 and the value of `ok` is calculated again.
The value of `ok` is then printed as output.

The output of code execution is:
111
END-OF-OUTPUT
