provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		double A = sc.nextInt();
		double B = sc.nextInt();
		double C = sc.nextInt();
		double D = sc.nextInt();
		double E = sc.nextInt();
		double F = sc.nextInt();
		double ans1 = A * 100;
		double ans2 = 0;
		for(int a = 0; a <= F / (A * 100); a++) {
			for(int b = 0; b <= F / (B * 100); b++) {
				for(int c = 0; c <= F / C; c++) {
					for(int d = 0; d <= F / D; d++) {
						if(100 * a * A + 100 * b * B + C * c + D * d <= F && (double)(C * c + D * d) / (double)(a * A * 100 + b * B * 100) <= (double)E / (double)100) {
							if(a == 0 && b == 0) continue;
							if((double)ans2 / (double)ans1 < (double)(C * c + D * d) / (double)(100 * a * A + 100 * b * B + C * c + D * d)) {
								ans1 = 100 * a * A + 100 * b * B + C * c + D * d;
								ans2 = C * c + D * d;
							}
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println((int)ans1 + " " + (int)ans2);

	}
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 2 10 20 15 200

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E` and `F` are initialized with 1, 2, 10, 20, 15 and 200, respectively.

The variable `ans1` is initialized with `A * 100` and `ans2` is initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates from 0 to `F / (A * 100)` and for each iteration, it iterates from 0 to `F / (B * 100)` and for each iteration, it iterates from 0 to `F / C` and for each iteration, it iterates from 0 to `F / D` and for each iteration, it checks if the sum of the values of `C * c + D * d` is less than or equal to `F` and if the ratio of `C * c + D * d` to the sum of `A * 100` and `B * 100` is less than or equal to `E / 100`. If both conditions are met, it checks if the current value of `ans2` is less than the current value of `C * c + D * d` divided by the current value of `100 * a * A + 100 * b * B + C * c + D * d`. If it is, it updates the value of `ans1` with the sum of `A * 100` and `B * 100` and `C * c + D * d` and updates the value of `ans2` with the current value of `C * c + D * d`.

After the for loop finishes, it prints the values of `ans1` and `ans2` as output, which are 1000 and 100.

The output of code execution is:
1000 100
END-OF-OUTPUT
