The variable `K` is initialized with 0.
The `solve` method is called with `K` as input.
The `a` array is initialized with `N` elements, where each element is initialized with `N - 1 + K / N`.
The loop iterates `K % N` times, where `K % N` is the remainder of `K` divided by `N`.
In each iteration, the loop iterates over all elements of the `a` array and decrements the element at index `i` by 1.
The loop continues until all elements of the `a` array have been decremented `K % N` times.
The `a` array is then converted to a string using `Arrays.stream(a).mapToObj(String::valueOf).collect(Collectors.joining(" "))`.
The output of the code execution is:
