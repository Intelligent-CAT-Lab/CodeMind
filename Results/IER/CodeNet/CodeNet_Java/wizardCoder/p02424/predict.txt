The variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 8 and 10, respectively.

The bitwise AND operator `&` is applied to `a` and `b` to get the result. The binary representation of the result is obtained by applying the `toString` method to the result. The `toString` method converts the binary representation of the result to a string. The `StringBuilder` class is used to build the string in reverse order.

The output of the code execution is:
1010
1110
1100
