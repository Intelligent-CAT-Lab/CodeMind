Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
<<Answer>>
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[]args) {
		try(Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in)){
			
			int X = scan.nextInt();
			
			int gohyaku = X/500;
			
			X = X-500*gohyaku;
			
			int goen = X/5;
			
			
			System.out.println(1000*gohyaku+5*goen);
		}
		
		
	}
		

}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1024

Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The output of the code execution would be:

2

END-OF-OUTPUT

Explanation:

The given code is to find the number of gohyaku and goen in a given amount of money. The amount of money is given as input. The code divides the amount of money by 500 to find the number of gohyaku and then subtracts 500 times the number of gohyaku from the amount of money. Similarly, it divides the remaining amount of money by 5 to find the number of goen. Finally, it multiplies the number of gohyaku by 1000 and adds the number of goen multiplied by 5 to get the total number of gohyaku and goen.
