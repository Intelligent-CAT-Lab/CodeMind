The variable `h` and `w` are initialized with 3 and 5, respectively. And variable `ans` is initialized with 100000001.

The first for loop is executed to calculate the minimum area of the rectangle with height `h` and width `w`. The area of the rectangle is calculated as `h*w`. The minimum area is calculated by iterating over all possible values of `w` and finding the minimum value of `h*w`. The minimum value is stored in `ans`.

The second for loop is executed to calculate the minimum area of the rectangle with height `w` and width `h`. The area of the rectangle is calculated as `w*h`. The minimum area is calculated by iterating over all possible values of `h` and finding the minimum value of `w*h`. The minimum value is stored in `ans`.

The third if statement is executed to calculate the minimum area of the rectangle with height `h` and width `w/3`. The area of the rectangle is calculated as `h*w/3`. The minimum area is calculated by iterating over all possible values of `w/3` and finding the minimum value of `h*w/3`. The minimum value is stored in `ans`.

The fourth if statement is executed to calculate the minimum area of the rectangle with height `h/3` and width `w`. The area of the rectangle is calculated as `w*h/3`. The minimum area is calculated by iterating over all possible values of `h/3` and finding the minimum value of `w*h/3`. The minimum value is stored in `ans`.

The final output of the code execution is:
