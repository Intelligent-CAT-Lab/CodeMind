Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;
class Main {
	static int INF = -10000000;
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(System.in);
		int sum = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
			int tmp = stdIn.nextInt();
			switch(i) {
			case 0:
				sum += tmp;
				break;
			case 1:
				sum += tmp*5;
				break;
			case 2:
				sum += tmp*10;
				break;
			case 3:
				sum += tmp * 50;
				break;
			case 4:
				sum += tmp * 100;
				break;
			case 5:
				sum += tmp * 500;
				break;
			}
		}
		
		if(sum >= 1000) {
			System.out.println(1);
		}
		else {
			System.out.println(0);
		}
	}
}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 1 4 0 4 1

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `sum` is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates 6 times and reads the input integer `tmp` from the standard input.
The switch statement is used to calculate the value of `sum` based on the index of the loop.
The first case adds the value of `tmp` to `sum`.
The second case multiplies the value of `tmp` by 5 and adds it to `sum`.
The third case multiplies the value of `tmp` by 10 and adds it to `sum`.
The fourth case multiplies the value of `tmp` by 50 and adds it to `sum`.
The fifth case multiplies the value of `tmp` by 100 and adds it to `sum`.
The sixth case multiplies the value of `tmp` by 500 and adds it to `sum`.

After the loop, the value of `sum` is checked. If it is greater than or equal to 1000, the output is 1. Otherwise, the output is 0.

The output of code execution is:
1
