Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.next();
		sc.close();
		s += '2';
		int n = s.length(), ans = n - 1;
		for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
			if(s.charAt(i)!= s.charAt(i + 1)) {
				int tmp = Math.max(i + 1,  n - i - 2);
				ans = Math.min(ans,  tmp);
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}

}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
010

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `s` is initialized with "010".
The variable `n` is initialized with the length of the string `s`, which is 4.
The variable `ans` is initialized with `n - 1`, which is 3.

The for loop iterates from 0 to `n - 2`, which is 0 to 2.
In each iteration, the if statement checks if the characters at positions `i` and `i + 1` are different.
If they are different, the variable `tmp` is initialized with the maximum of `i + 1` and `n - i - 2`, which is 1 and 1, respectively.
The variable `ans` is updated with the minimum of `ans` and `tmp`, which is 1.

After the loop finishes, the final value of variable `ans` is printed as output, which is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
END-OF-OUTPUT
