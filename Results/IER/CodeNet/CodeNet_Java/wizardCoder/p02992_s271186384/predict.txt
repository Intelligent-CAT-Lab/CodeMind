The variable `n` and `k` are initialized with 3 and 2, respectively.

The variable `mod` is initialized with 1000000007.

The variable `rn` is calculated as the square root of `n` and rounded down to the nearest integer.

The variable `cnt` is an array of size `rn + 1` that stores the count of numbers that are divisible by each integer from 1 to `rn`.

The variable `dp` is a 2D array of size `k + 1` x `rn + 1` that stores the number of ways to choose `k` numbers from the range [1, n] that are divisible by each integer from 1 to `rn`.

The variable `ans` is initialized with 0.
