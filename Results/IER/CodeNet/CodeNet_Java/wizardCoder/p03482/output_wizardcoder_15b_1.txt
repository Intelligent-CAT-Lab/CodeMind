Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
<<Answer>>
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;
 
class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    String S = scan.next();
    int ans = 0;
    if(S.length()%2==0){
      if(S.charAt(S.length() /2 -1)!= S.charAt(S.length() /2)){
        System.out.println(S.length() /2);
        return;
      }else{
        S = S.substring(0, S.length() /2) + S.substring(S.length() /2 +1);
        ans =1;
      }
    }
    int mid = S.length() /2;
    for(int i=1;i+mid <= S.length();++i){
      if(i+mid==S.length() || S.charAt(mid+i)!=S.charAt(mid) || S.charAt(mid-i)!=S.charAt(mid)){
        ans += mid + i;
        break;
      }
    }
    System.out.println(ans);
  }
}
      
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
010

Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The output of the code execution would be:

2

END-OF-OUTPUT

Explanation:

The code takes a string as input and checks if the length of the string is even or odd. If the length is even, it checks if the middle character is different from the character on its left or right. If it is, it removes the middle character and increments the answer by the length of the string. If the length is odd, it sets the middle index to the middle character and checks if the characters on both sides are the same. If they are, it removes the middle character and increments the answer by the length of the string. If they are not, it sets the answer to 0 and exits the loop. Finally, it prints the answer.
