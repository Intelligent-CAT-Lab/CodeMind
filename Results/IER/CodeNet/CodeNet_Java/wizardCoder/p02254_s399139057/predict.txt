The variable `arr` is initialized with the input string "abca".
The variable `alpha` is initialized with an array of size 26, where each element is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates over each character in the input string `arr` and increments the corresponding element in the `alpha` array by 1.
The `PriorityQueue` `queue` is initialized with a new instance of the `Node` class.
The for loop iterates over each element in the `alpha` array and adds a new `Node` object to the `queue` if the element is greater than 0.
