The variable `n` is initialized with 10.
The function `solver` is called with the input `n`.
The function `solver` calculates the square root of `n` and stores it in the variable `sqrt`.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from `sqrt` to 1.
In each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it stores the value of `i` in the variable `x` and the value of `n/i` in the variable `y`. It then breaks out of the loop.
If the loop finishes without finding a divisor, it sets the values of `x` and `y` to 0.
If `x` and `y` are both non-zero, it calculates the value of `ans` as `(x-1)+(y-1)`.
If `x` and `y` are both zero, it calculates the value of `ans` as `n-1`.
The function `solver` then prints the value of `ans` as output.

The function `gcd` is called with the input `a` and `b`.
The function `gcd` calculates the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.

The main function is called with the input `inputStream` and `outputStream`.
The main function creates an object of the class `InputReader` and an object of the class `PrintWriter`.
The main function calls the function `solver` with the input `in` and `out`.
The main function closes the `out` object.

The class `InputReader` is a helper class that reads input from the standard input stream.
The class `InputReader` has a constructor that takes an input stream as input.
The class `InputReader` has a method `next` that reads the next token from the input stream.
The class `InputReader` has a method `nextInt` that reads the next integer from the input stream.
The class `InputReader` has a method `nextLong` that reads the next long integer from the input stream.
The class `InputReader` has a method `readLongArr` that reads an array of long integers from the input stream.
The class `InputReader` has a method `readIntArr` that reads an array of integers from the input stream.

The class `Pair` is a helper class that represents a pair of integers and a string.
The class `Pair` has a constructor that takes an integer `x` and a string `s` as input.
The class `Pair` has a method `compareTo` that compares two `Pair` objects based on their `x` values.
