Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT

Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Your code here!
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        if (n == 1 || n == 2 || n == 3 || n == 4 || n == 5 || n == 6 || n == 7 || n == 8 || n == 9 ||
        n == 2 || n == 6 || n == 8 || n == 10 || n == 12 || n == 14 || n == 16 || n == 18 ||
        n == 4 || n == 9 || n == 12 || n == 15 || n == 18 || n == 21 || n == 24 || n == 27 ||
        n == 6 || n == 12 || n == 16 || n == 20 || n == 24 || n == 28 || n == 32 || n == 36 ||
        n == 8 || n == 15 || n == 20 || n == 25 || n == 30 || n == 35 || n == 40 || n == 45 ||
        n == 10 || n == 18 || n == 24 || n == 30 || n == 36 || n == 42 || n == 48 || n == 54 ||
        n == 12 || n == 21 || n == 28 || n == 35 || n == 42 || n == 49 || n == 56 || n == 63 ||
        n == 14 || n == 24 || n == 32 || n == 40 || n == 48 || n == 56 || n == 64 || n == 72 ||
        n == 16 || n == 27 || n == 36 || n == 45 || n == 54 || n == 63 || n == 72 || n == 81) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }
        
    }
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
10

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `n` is initialized with 10.
The if statement checks if `n` is equal to any of the given numbers in the if condition. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

The given numbers are:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 4, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 6, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 8, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 10, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 12, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 14, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 16, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81

The if condition checks if `n` is equal to any of the given numbers. Since `n` is not equal to any of the given numbers, it prints "No".

The output of code execution is:
No
END-OF-OUTPUT
