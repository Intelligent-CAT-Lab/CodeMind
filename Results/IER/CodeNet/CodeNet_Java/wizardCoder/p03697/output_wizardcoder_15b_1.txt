Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
<<Answer>>
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		if (a + b >= 10) {
    		System.out.println("error"); 
		}
		else {
		    System.out.println(a + b);
		}
	}
}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
6 3

Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The output of the code execution would be:

9

END-OF-OUTPUT

Explanation:

The code takes two integers as input from the user using the Scanner class. It then checks if the sum of the two integers is greater than or equal to 10. If it is, it prints "error". Otherwise, it prints the sum of the two integers. In this case, the sum of 6 and 3 is 9, which is less than 10, so the code prints 9.
