Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
<<Answer>>
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

import static java.lang.System.in;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)throws IOException{
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long K = sc.nextLong(), A=sc.nextLong(), B=sc.nextLong();
        long ans = help(K,A,B);
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
    static long help(long K, long A, long B){
        if(A<=B) return A>=K?1:-1;
        if(A>=K) return 1;
        long dif = (A-B);
        long t = (K-A)/dif+((K-A)%dif==0?0:1);
        return 2*t+1;
    }
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4000 2000 500

Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The output of the code execution would be:

1

END-OF-OUTPUT

Explanation:

The given code takes three inputs, K, A and B. It then calls the help() function with these inputs. The help() function takes three inputs, K, A and B. 

In the help() function, we first check if A is less than or equal to B. If it is, we return 1 if A is greater than or equal to K, and -1 otherwise. 

If A is greater than or equal to K, we return 1. 

If A is less than B, we calculate the difference between A and B. We then calculate the number of times K can be divided by this difference. We add 1 to this number if K is exactly divisible by the difference. 

Finally, we return 2 times the number of times K can be divided by the difference, plus 1.
