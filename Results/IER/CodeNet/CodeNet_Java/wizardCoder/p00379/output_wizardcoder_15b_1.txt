Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
<<Answer>>
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();
		int max = (int) Math.pow(m, (double) 1 / n);
		
		int ans = 0;
		for(int i = 1; i <= max; i++) {
			int x = (int) Math.pow(i, n);
			String str = String.valueOf(x);
			int y = 0;
			for(int j = 0; j < str.length(); j++) {
				y += Integer.parseInt(str.substring(j, j + 1));
			}
			
			if(y + a == i) {
				ans++;
			}
		}
		
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
16 2 1000

Only print the output of code execution and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The output of the code execution would be:

1

END-OF-OUTPUT

Explanation:

The given code takes three integers as input, a, n, and m. It then calculates the maximum value of x that can be formed using the given values of n and m. It then iterates through all the values of x from 1 to the maximum value and checks if the sum of digits of x is equal to a. If it is, then it increments the answer variable. Finally, it prints the value of the answer variable.

For the given input, the maximum value of x that can be formed is 1000, and the value of x is 16. The sum of digits of 16 is 1 + 6 = 7, which is not equal to 16. Therefore, the answer variable remains 0.
