### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try(Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)){
           int a = sc.nextInt();
           int b = sc.nextInt();
           int c = sc.nextInt();
           boolean flag = true;
           int y = 0;
           loop:for(int i=0;i<=60;i++) {
        	   int x = i*60+c;
        	   while(x-y>=a+b) y += (a+b);
        	   if(1<=x-y && x-y<=a) {
        		   System.out.println(x);
        		   flag = false;
        		   break loop;
        	   }
           }
           if(flag) System.out.println("-1");          
        }
    }
}

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
10 10 5

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `a`, `b` and `c` are initialized with 10, 10 and 5, respectively.
The variable `flag` is initialized with true.
The variable `y` is initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates from 0 to 60. In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is multiplied by 60 and added to variable `c` to get the value of variable `x`.

The while loop runs until the value of variable `x` is greater than or equal to the sum of variable `a` and variable `b`. In each iteration, the value of variable `y` is incremented by the sum of variable `a` and variable `b`.

If the condition `1<=x-y && x-y<=a` is true, it means that the value of variable `x` is within the range [1, a]. Therefore, it prints the value of variable `x` as output and sets the value of variable `flag` to false. It also breaks out of the for loop.

If the condition `1<=x-y && x-y<=a` is false for all values of variable `x`, it means that there is no value of variable `x` that satisfies the condition. Therefore, it prints -1 as output.

The output of code execution is:
50
