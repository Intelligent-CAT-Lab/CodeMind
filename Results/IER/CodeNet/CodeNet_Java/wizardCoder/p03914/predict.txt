The variable `n` is initialized with 3 and variable `m` is initialized with 3.

The variable `dp` is initialized with a 2D array of size (n+1)x(n+1) with all elements initialized with 0.

The first row and first column of the `dp` array are initialized with 1.

The for loop iterates from 0 to m-1. In each iteration, a new 2D array `next` is created with the same size as `dp`.

The for loop iterates over all elements of `dp` and calculates the next state of `dp` using the following formula:

```
dp[a][b] = dp[a][b] * (a+b) % MOD
```

The formula calculates the number of ways to choose `a` balls from the first row and `b` balls from the first column and place them in the `a+b`th row and `b+a`th column of the `dp` array.

The formula is used to calculate the number of ways to place `a` balls in the first row and `b` balls in the first column.
