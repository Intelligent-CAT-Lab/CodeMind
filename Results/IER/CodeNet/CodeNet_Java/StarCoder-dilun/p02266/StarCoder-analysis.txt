The variable profile is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates over each character c in the string profile.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is a backslash. If it is, it decreases the value of variable lv by 1.
If the current character c is a forward slash, it increases the value of variable lv by 1.
If the current character c is neither a backslash nor a forward slash, it increases the value of variable pos by 1.
If the current character c is a backslash, it pushes the value of variable pos to the list.
If the current character c is a forward slash, it checks if the list is empty. If it is not empty, it removes the last element of the list and stores it in variable start.
Then it calculates the area of the current character c by subtracting the value of variable pos from the value of variable start.
If the value of variable lv is 0, it prints the calculated area as output.
