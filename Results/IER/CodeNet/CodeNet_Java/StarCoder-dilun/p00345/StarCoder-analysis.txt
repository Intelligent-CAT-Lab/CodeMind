The variable an, ad, bn, bd are initialized with 0, 1, 0 and 1 respectively.
The input is split into two parts by the character '(' and ')'. The first part is the non-recurring part and the second part is the recurring part.
If the second part is not empty, it means that the input has a recurring part.
The non-recurring part is split into two parts by the character '.'. The first part is the integer part and the second part is the decimal part.
If the second part is not empty, it means that the input has a decimal part.
The integer part is converted to an integer and assigned to variable an.
The decimal part is converted to an integer and assigned to variable ad.
If the second part is empty, it means that the input has no decimal part.
The recurring part is converted to an integer and assigned to variable bn.
The length of the recurring part is assigned to variable bd.
The final value of variable an is calculated by multiplying the integer part by the decimal part and adding the non-recurring part.
The final value of variable ad is calculated by multiplying the decimal part by the length of the recurring part.
The final value of variable bn is calculated by multiplying the integer part by the decimal part and adding the non-recurring part.
The final value of variable bd is calculated by multiplying the decimal part by the length of the recurring part.
The final value of variable n is calculated by multiplying the final value of variable an by the least common multiple of variable ad and variable bd.
The final value of variable d is calculated by multiplying the final value of variable bd by the least common multiple of variable ad and variable bd.
The final value of variable n is divided by the greatest common divisor of variable n and variable d.
The final value of variable d is divided by the greatest common divisor of variable n and variable d.
The final value of variable n is assigned to variable n.
The final value of variable d is assigned to variable d.
The final value of variable n and variable d are printed as the output.
