The variable N is initialized with 10 and variable X is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by X. If it is, it prints the current interger i with a space in between.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable i as output, which is 3 6 9.
