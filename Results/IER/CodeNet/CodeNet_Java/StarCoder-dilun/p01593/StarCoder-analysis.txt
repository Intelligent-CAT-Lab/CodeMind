The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the probability of getting a head by repeatedlly flipping a coin with a probability of 1/2. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4 and j is 1,2,3,4.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp[n] as output, which is 0.9375.
