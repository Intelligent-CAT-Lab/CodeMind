The variable n is initialized with the input.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of the array at index i is greater than the value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the value of the array at index i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 5.
