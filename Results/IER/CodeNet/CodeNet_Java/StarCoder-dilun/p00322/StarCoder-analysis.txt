The variable nums is initialized with 4 rows and 3 columns. The variable used is initialized with 10 boolean values.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
The variable layout is initialized with 12 values.
The variable ret is initialized with 0.
The variable i is initialized with 0.
The variable j is initialized with 0.
The variable k is initialized with 1.
The variable a is initialized with 4 integer values.
The variable n is initialized with 0.
The variable words is initialized with 9 string values.
The variable n is parsed to an integer value and assigned to variable n.
If n is not equal to -1, it is assigned to variable used at the index of n.
Else, it is incremented by 1.
The value of variable n is assigned to the element of variable nums at the index of the value of variable layout at the index of i and the value of variable layout at the index of j.
The value of variable count is assigned to variable ret.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable k.
The while loop iterates from 1 to 9 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable n.
If the value of variable used at the index of n is false, it is assigned to variable used at the index of n.
Else, it is assigned to variable nums at the index of i and the value of variable j and it is assigned to variable used at the index of n.
The value of variable ret is incremented by 1.
The value of variable nums at the index of i and the value of variable j is assigned to variable n.
The value of variable used at the index of n is assigned to false.
The value of variable ret is returned as output.
