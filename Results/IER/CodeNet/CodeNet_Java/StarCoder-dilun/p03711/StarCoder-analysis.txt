The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is greater than the current maximum value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the current interger i.
It also checks if the current interger i is less than the current minimum value of variable min. If it is, it updates the value of variable min
