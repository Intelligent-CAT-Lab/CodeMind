The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to initialize the array arr with 5 elements.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the element of array arr with index i with the value of variable i.
After the for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each element of array arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the element of array arr with index i is greater than variable max.
If it is, it sets variable max to the element of array arr with index i.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable max as output, which is 5.
