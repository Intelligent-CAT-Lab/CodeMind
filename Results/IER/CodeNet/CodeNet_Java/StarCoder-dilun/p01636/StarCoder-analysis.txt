The variable n is initialized with 19.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to variable n. The value of variable i is also passed to variable head.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger head by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
