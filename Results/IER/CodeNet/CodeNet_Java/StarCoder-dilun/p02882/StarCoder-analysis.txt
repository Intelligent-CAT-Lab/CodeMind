The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 3, 2, 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger x falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger x to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum * c as output, which is 15.
