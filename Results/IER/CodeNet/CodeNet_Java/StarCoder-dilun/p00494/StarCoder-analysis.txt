The variable n is initialized with the input integer.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i+1 to n-1.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the value of arr[i] is greater than the value of arr[j]. If it is, it swaps the values of arr[i] and arr[j].
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the value of arr[i] is greater than 0. If it is, it adds the value of arr[i] to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1
