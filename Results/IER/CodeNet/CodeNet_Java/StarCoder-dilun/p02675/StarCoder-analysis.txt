The variable N is initialized with 15.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to N. If it is, it prints "perfect".
If it is not, it checks if the calculated variable sum is greater than N. If it is, it prints "abundant".
If it is not, it prints "deficient".
The condition is met when N is divisible by 1,3,5,15.
After the if statement, it prints "deficient" as output.
