The variable n and variable K are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from K + 1 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable ans.
Then it checks if the calculated variable ans falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 10.
