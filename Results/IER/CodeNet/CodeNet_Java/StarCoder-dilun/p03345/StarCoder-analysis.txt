The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable k are initialized with 1, 2, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The value of variable ans is initialized with the value of variable a minus the value of variable b.
Then it checks if the absolute value of variable ans is greater than 10^18. If it is, it prints "Unfair" and returns.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable k is even or odd. If it is even, it prints the value of variable ans.
Otherwise, it prints the negative value of variable ans.
