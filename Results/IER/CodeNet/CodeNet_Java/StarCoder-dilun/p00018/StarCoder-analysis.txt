The variable ans is initialized with an array of 5 integers.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the input is exhausted.
Inside the while loop, it reads the next integer from the input and assigns it to variable num.
Then it assigns the value of variable num to the next index of the array ans.
Then it checks if the number of elements in the array ans is 5. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it sorts the array ans in descending order and assigns the first 5 elements of the array to variable result.
Then it returns the value of variable result as output.
