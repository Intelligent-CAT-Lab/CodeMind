The variable n is initialized with 5.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of size n.
The variable dp is initialized with an array of size n.
The variable dp[0] is initialized with arr[0].
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable dp[i].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum of the sum of the previous maximum value dp[i - 1] and the current value arr[i] and the current value arr[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp[n - 1] as output, which is 15.
