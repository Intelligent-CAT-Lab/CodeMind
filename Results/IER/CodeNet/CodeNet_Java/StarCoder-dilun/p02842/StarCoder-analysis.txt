The variable N is initialized with 12 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 12 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the remainder of the current interger N divided by i.
Then it checks if the calculated variable num is equal to 0. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 28.
