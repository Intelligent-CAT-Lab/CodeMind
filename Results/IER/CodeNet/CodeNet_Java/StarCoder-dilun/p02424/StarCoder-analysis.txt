The variable n is initialized with 20 according to the input.
The variable a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y and z are initialized with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 respectively according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
The variable sum is incremented by the value of each variable a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y and z.
The final output is the value of variable sum.
