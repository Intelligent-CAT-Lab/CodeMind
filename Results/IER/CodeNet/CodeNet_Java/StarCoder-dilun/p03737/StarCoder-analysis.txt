The variable n, variable a, variable b, variable c, variable d, variable e, variable f, variable g, variable h, variable i, variable j, variable k, variable l, variable m, variable n, variable o, variable p, variable q, variable r, variable s, variable t, variable u, variable v, variable w, variable x, variable y, variable z are initialized with 100, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 and 100 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 99 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 100.
