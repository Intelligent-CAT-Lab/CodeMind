The variable w, variable h, variable x and variable y are initialized with 2, 3, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the area of the rectangle with the formula (w * h) / 2.
Then it checks if the sum of the variables x and y is equal to the sum of the variables w and h. If it is, it sets variable a to 1.
Finally, it prints the final value of variables ans and a as output, which is 6.0 1.
