The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger arr[i] is greater than the current maximum value of variable max. If it is, it updates the current maximum value of variable max with arr[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 5.
