The variable n is initialized with 3.
The variable m is initialized with 10.
The variable arr is initialized with 1, 2 and 3.
The variable dp is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable k.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the sum of the values of variable dp with the value of variable dp with the value of variable j minus the value of variable arr[i].
After the second for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp with the value of variable m as output, which is 10.
