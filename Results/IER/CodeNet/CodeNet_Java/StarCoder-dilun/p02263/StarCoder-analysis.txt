The variable n is initialized with the input.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of size n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to initialize each element of the array arr with the input.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current element of the array arr is greater than the variable max. If it is, it updates the variable max with the current element.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable max as output.
