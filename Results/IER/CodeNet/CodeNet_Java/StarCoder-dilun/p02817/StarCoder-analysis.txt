The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger num falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 14.
