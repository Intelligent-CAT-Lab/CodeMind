The variable x is initialized with 20 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is not divisible by 3 or not. If it is not divisible by 3, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 200.
