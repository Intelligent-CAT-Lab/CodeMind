The code first replaces all the dots with commas and then replaces all the commas with spaces.
Then it splits the input string into tokens by spaces.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the tokens array.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the length of the current token.
If the length of the current token is greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 6, it prints the substring of the current token from index 0 to the length of the current token.
If the substring is printed, it increments the value of variable count.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable count is greater than 0. If it is, it prints a new line.
