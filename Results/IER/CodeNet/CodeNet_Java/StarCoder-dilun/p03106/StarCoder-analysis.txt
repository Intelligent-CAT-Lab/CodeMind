The variable N is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable A.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger A falls within the range [65, 90] or [97, 122] or [48, 57]. If it does, it adds 1 to the corresponding variable. The condition is met when A is 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J'.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y and z as output, which is 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.
