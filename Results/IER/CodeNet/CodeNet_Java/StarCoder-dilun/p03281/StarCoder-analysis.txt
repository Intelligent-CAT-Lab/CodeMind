The variable n is initialized with 105 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 105 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is odd. If it is, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 105 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current interger k is divisible by the current interger i. If it is, it adds 1 to variable divcount. The condition is met when k is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42
