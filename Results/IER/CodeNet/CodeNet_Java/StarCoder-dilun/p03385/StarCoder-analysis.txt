The variable n is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the element of array a with the value of variable i.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each element of array a.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current element of array a is greater than the current value of variable max. If it does, it sets the value of variable max to the current element of array a.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 5.
