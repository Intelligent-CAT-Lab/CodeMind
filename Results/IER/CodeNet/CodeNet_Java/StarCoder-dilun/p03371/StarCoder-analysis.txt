The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It initializes an array of size n with all elements initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i + 1 to n - 1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the value of arr[i] is greater than the value of arr[j]. If it is, it swaps the values of arr[i] and arr[j].
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the value of arr[i] is greater than the value of max. If it is, it updates the value of max with the value of arr[i].
