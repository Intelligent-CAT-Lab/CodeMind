<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 20.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable left.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable left by subtracting the current interger i multiplied by 7 from variable N.
Then it checks if the calculated variable left is divisible by 4. If it is, it sets the value of variable check to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable check is true. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
