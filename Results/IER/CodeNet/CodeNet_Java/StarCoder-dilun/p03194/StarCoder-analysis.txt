The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable p is initialized with 24.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 24 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the power of the current interger i to the power of variable n.
Then it checks if the calculated variable num is divisible by the current interger i. If it is, it sets the current interger i as the final value of variable res.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 8.
