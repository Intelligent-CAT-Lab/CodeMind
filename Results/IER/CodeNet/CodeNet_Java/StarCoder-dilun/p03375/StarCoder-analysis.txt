The variable M is initialized with 1000000007.
The variable N is initialized with 3.
The variable C is initialized with the result of calling the complex function with parameter N.
The variable S is initialized with the result of calling the stirling function with parameter N.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable res by calling the ways function with parameter i.
Then it adds the current interger i to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 0, 2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
