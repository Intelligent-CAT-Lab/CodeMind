The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to initialize the array arr with 5 elements.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the current interger i to the value of the variable n.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is greater than the variable max. If it is, it updates the variable max with the current interger i.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is equal to the variable max. If it is, it adds 1 to the count variable.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 5.
