The variable N is initialized with the input integer. The variable arr is initialized with an array of length N. The variable ans is initialized with an array of length N. The variable curIndex is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string minus 1.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the current index of the array arr with the value of variable i.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the current index of the array arr is equal to 1. If it is, it increments the value of variable numRight by 1 and increments the value of variable curIndex by 1. If the current index is equal to the length of the input string, it breaks out of the while loop.
It decrements the value of variable curIndex by 1.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the current index of the array arr is equal to 2. If it is, it increments the value of variable numLeft by 1 and increments the value of variable curIndex by 1. If the current index is equal to the length of the input string, it breaks out of the while loop.
It decrements the value of variable curIndex by 1.
It initializes two variables left and right with the values of variables numLeft and numRight.
If the sum of the values of variables numLeft and numRight is even, it initializes the value of variable left with the sum of the values of variables numLeft and numRight divided by 2 and initializes the value of variable right with the same value.
If the sum of the values of variables numLeft and numRight is odd, it initializes the value of variable right with the sum of the values of variables numLeft and numRight divided by 2 and initializes the value of variable left with the sum of the values of variables numLeft and numRight minus the value of variable right.
It initializes the value of the current index of the array ans with the value of variable left.
It increments the value of variable curIndex by 1.
It initializes the value of the current index of the array ans with the value of variable right.
It increments the value of variable curIndex by 1.
It checks if the current index is equal to the length of the input string minus 1. If it is, it breaks out of the while loop.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string minus 1.
Inside the for loop, it prints the value of the current index of the array ans.
