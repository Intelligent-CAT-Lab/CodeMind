The variable n is initialized with 5 and variable m is initialized with 5.
It checks if n is even. If it is, it calculates the value of a as n/2.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of a as (n-1)/2.
It checks if m is even. If it is, it calculates the value of b as m/2.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of b as (m-1)/2.
It initializes variable ans with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to a-1.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to b-1.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if i+j is equal to n-1. If it is, it increments variable ans by 1.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints the value of ans as output.
