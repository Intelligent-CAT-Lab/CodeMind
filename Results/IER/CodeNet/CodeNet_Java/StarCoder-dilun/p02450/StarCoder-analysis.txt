The variable n is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable str2.
Inside the for loop, it concatenates the current interger i to variable str.
After the loop finishes, it calls the function permutation with the value of variable str and an empty string as parameters.
The function permutation is called recursively with the value of variable str and an empty string as parameters.
The function permutation is called recursively with the value of variable str and a string with the value of variable i as parameters.
