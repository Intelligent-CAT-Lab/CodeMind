The variable s is initialized with the input string "aabxyyzz".
The variable d is initialized with an array of 1<<26 elements.
The variable mask is initialized with 0.
The variable ans is initialized with the length of the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable c by subtracting the character of the current index of the input string from 'a'.
Then it calculates the value of variable m by XORing the value of variable mask with 1<<c.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from -1 to 25 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable cur by adding 1 to the value of variable d[m^mask].
Then it checks if the current index of the input string is the last index of the input string. If it is, it calculates the value of variable ans by taking the minimum of the value of variable ans and the value of variable cur.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
