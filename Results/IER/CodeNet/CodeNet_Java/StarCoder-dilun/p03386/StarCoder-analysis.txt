The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized with 3, 8 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to 8 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable set. The condition is met when i is 3,4,5,6,7 and 8.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 8 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable set. The condition is met when i is 8,7,6,5,4 and 3.
