The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
The variable k is initialized with 2 according to the input.
The variable arr is initialized with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by variable k. If it is, it increments variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
