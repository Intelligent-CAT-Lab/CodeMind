The code first reads the input and stores it in a variable S. Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable converted.
Inside the for loop, it iterates from 0 to the length of variable S to check each character c in this range. The value of variable c is also passed to variable c.
If the character c is in the range [a, z], it adds i to the character c to get the new character. If the new character is greater than 'z', it subtracts 26 from the new character to get the new character.
If the new character is in the range [a, z], it adds i to the character c to get the new character. If the new character is greater than 'z', it subtracts 26 from the new character to get the new character.
