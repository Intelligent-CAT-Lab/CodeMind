The variable word is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string word minus 1. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string word at index i is equal to the current character of the string word at index i plus 1. If it is, it sets the flag variable to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the flag variable is true. If it is, it prints "Bad" as output. Otherwise, it prints "Good" as output.
