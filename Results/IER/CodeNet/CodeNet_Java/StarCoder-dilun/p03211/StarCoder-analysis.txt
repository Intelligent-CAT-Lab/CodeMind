The variable N is initialized with the input integer.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the value of variable N to initialize the array arr. The value of variable i is also passed to the array index.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the remainder of the current interger and the next interger in the array.
Then it checks if the calculated remainder is greater than the current maximum value of variable max. If it is, it updates the current maximum value of variable max with the calculated remainder.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 0.
