The variable x is initialized with 33.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the condition is met.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable powVal by calling the pow() method.
Then it checks if the calculated variable powVal is already present in the HashMap. If it is, it prints the values of the two keys in the HashMap.
If it is not, it adds the current value of variable base and the previous value of variable powVal to the HashMap.
After the loop finishes, it prints the output as the two keys in the HashMap.
