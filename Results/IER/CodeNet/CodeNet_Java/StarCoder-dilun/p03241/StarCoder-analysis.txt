The variable n is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it increments the value of variable c by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable c as output, which is 2.
