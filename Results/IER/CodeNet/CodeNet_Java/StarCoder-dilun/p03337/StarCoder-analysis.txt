The variable n, m, k, l, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i and j are initialized with 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check each integer x in this range. The value of variable x is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to m - 1 to check each integer y in this range. The value of variable y is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to k - 1 to check each integer z in this range. The value of variable z is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to l - 1 to check each integer w in this range. The value of variable w is also passed to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to the sum of the values of variables x, y, z and w. If it is, it adds the current interger x + y + z + w to variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
It also print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 1.
