The variable n is initialized with the input integer 5.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of length n.
The variable max is initialized with the first element of the array arr.
The variable min is initialized with the first element of the array arr.
The for loop iterates from 1 to n - 1.
Inside the for loop, if the element at index i of the array arr is greater than the value of variable max, the value of variable max is set to the element at index i of the array arr.
If the element at index i of the array arr is less than the value of variable min, the value of variable min is set to the element at index i of the array arr.
The program prints the value of variable max minus the value of variable min as output, which is 4.
