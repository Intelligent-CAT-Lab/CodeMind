The variable n is initialized with the input integer.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of n integers.
The variable max is initialized with the first element of the array.
The variable min is initialized with the first element of the array.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is greater than the variable max. If it is, it sets the variable max to the current interger i.
It also checks if the current interger i is less than the variable min. If it is, it sets the variable min to the current interger i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max - min as output, which is 4.
