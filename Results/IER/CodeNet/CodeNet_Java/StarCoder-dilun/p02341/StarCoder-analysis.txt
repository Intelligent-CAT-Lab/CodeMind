The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It initializes an array of size n with all elements initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i+1 to n-1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the sum of arr[i] and arr[j] is equal to k. If it is, it increments the variable count by 1.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 3.
