The variable N is initialized with "0" + the input. The length of variable N is calculated by the length() method of String class.
The variable dp is initialized with a 2-dimensional array of long type. The first dimension of dp is the length of variable N plus 1. The second dimension of dp is 3.
The first element of the first dimension of dp is initialized with 1. The first element of the second dimension of dp is initialized with 1.
The for loop iterates from 1 to the length of variable N. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the minimum value of the first element of the second dimension of dp, the second element of the second dimension of dp and the third element of the second dimension of dp.
The first element of the second dimension of dp is calculated by adding 9 to variable c. The second element of the second dimension of dp is calculated by adding variable c to the first element of the second dimension of dp. The third element of the second dimension of dp is calculated by adding variable c to the first element of the second dimension of dp plus 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the minimum value of the first element of the second dimension of dp, the second element of the second dimension of dp and the third element of the second dimension of dp as output, which is 1.
