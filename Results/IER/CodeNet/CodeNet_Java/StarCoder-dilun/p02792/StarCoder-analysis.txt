The variable n is initialized with 25.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 25 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the first digit of the current interger num and the last digit of the current interger num.
Then it checks if the last digit of the current interger num is 0. If it is, it skips the current interger i and continues to the next interger i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 10.
