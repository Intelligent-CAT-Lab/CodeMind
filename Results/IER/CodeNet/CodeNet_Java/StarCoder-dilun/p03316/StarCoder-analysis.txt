The variable n is initialized with 20.
The variable a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z are initialized with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 respectively.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
The variable sum is calculated by adding all the variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z.
The final value of variable sum is printed as output.
