The variable a is initialized with 3, 1, 4, 0, 4 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a[i].
After the loop finishes, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a[i] by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable b.
Then it checks if the calculated variable b is even or odd. If it is even, it prints 1 as output. Otherwise, it prints 0 as output.
