The variable s is initialized with the input string "aa".
The variable a is initialized with the length of the string s.
The variable flag is initialized with true.
It checks if the first character of the string s is equal to the last character of the string s. If it is, it checks if the length of the string s is odd or even. If it is odd, it sets the value of variable flag to false. If it is even, it sets the value of variable flag to true.
If the value of variable flag is true, it prints "First" as output. Otherwise, it prints "Second" as output.
