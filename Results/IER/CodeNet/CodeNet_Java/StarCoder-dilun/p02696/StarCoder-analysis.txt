The variable a, variable b and variable n are initialized with 123456789, 987654321 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It initializes variable c with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the last digit of variable a is equal to the last digit of variable b.
If it is, it adds 1 to variable c.
Then it divides variable a by 10 and variable b by 10.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable c as output.
