The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 5, 10, 10 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the value of variable n - 1.
Inside the for loop, it initializes variable x, variable y and variable z with the values of the next three integers in the input.
Then it checks if the sum of variable x, variable y and variable z is equal to variable a. If it is, it increments variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes,
