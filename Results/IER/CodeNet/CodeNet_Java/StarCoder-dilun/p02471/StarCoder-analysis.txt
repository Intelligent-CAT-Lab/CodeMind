<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 12 respectively according to the input.
Then it enters a while loop and it calculates the quotient q of the division of variable a by variable b.
Then it calculates the remainder r3 of the division of variable a by variable b.
Then it calculates the value of variable x3 by subtracting the product of variable q and variable x2 from variable x1.
Then it calculates the value of variable y3 by subtracting the product of variable q and variable y2 from variable y1.
Then it calculates the value of variable r1 by swapping the values of variable r1 and variable r2.
Then it calculates the value of variable r2 by swapping the values of variable r1 and variable r2.
Then it calculates the value of variable x1 by swapping the values of variable x1 and variable x2.
Then it calculates the value of variable x2 by swapping the values of variable x1 and variable x2.
Then it calculates the value of variable y1 by swapping the values of variable y1 and variable y2.
Then it calculates the value of variable y2 by swapping the values of variable y1 and variable y2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x1 and variable y1 as output, which is -2 1.
