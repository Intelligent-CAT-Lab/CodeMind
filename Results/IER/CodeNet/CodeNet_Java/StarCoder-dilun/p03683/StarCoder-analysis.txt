The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than 1. If it is, it sets the value of variable result to 0.
If the absolute difference between n and m is equal to 1, it calls the method factorialsModBillion(n, m) to calculate the value of variable result.
If the absolute difference between n and m is equal to 0, it calculates the value of variable result by calling the method factorialsModBillion(n, m) twice and multiplying the result by 2.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable result as output, which is 1.
