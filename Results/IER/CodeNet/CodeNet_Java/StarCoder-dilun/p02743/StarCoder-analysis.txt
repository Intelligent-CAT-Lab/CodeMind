The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 3 and 9 respectively according to the input.
The value of variable d is calculated by subtracting variable c from variable a and variable b.
Then it checks if the calculated variable d is positive and if the condition 4 * a * b < d * d is met.
If the condition is met, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
