The variable N, variable A, variable B, variable C and variable D are initialized with 5, 1, 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable max and variable min.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum value of the current interger i by calculating the difference of variable D multiplied by (N-1-i) and variable C multiplied by i.
It also calculates the minimum value of the current interger i by calculating the difference of variable C multiplied by (N-1-i) and variable D multiplied by i.
Then it checks if the calculated variable max and variable min fall within the range [2, 4]. If it does, it increments variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 2.
