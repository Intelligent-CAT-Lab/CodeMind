The variable S is initialized with the input string.
It checks if the string is empty. If it is, it returns true.
Then it checks if the first character of the string is'm'. If it is not, it returns false.
Then it initializes a variable en with 1.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the string S. The value of variable i is also passed to variable en.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string is'm'. If it is, it increments the value of variable en by 1.
If the current character is 'e', it decrements the value of variable en by 1.
If the value of variable en is not 0, it continues the loop.
If the value of variable en is 0, it breaks out of the loop.
Then it initializes a variable i with 1.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the string S. The value of variable i is also passed to variable mn.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string is 'e'. If it is, it increments the value of variable mn by 1.
If the current character is 'w', it decrements the value of variable mn by 1.
If the value of variable mn is not 0, it continues the loop.
If the value of variable mn is 0, it breaks out of the loop.
Then it checks if the length of the string S is equal to the value of variable i. If it is, it returns false.
Then it initializes a variable eindex with the value of variable i.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the string S. The value of variable i is also passed to variable mn.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string is 'e'. If it is, it increments the value of variable mn by 1.
If the current character is 'w', it decrements the value of variable mn by 1.
If the value of variable mn is not 0, it continues the loop.
If the value of variable mn is 0, it breaks out of the loop.
Then it checks if the length of the string S is equal to the value of variable i. If it is, it returns false.
Then it calls the function saiki recursively with the substring of the string S starting from index 1 and ending at index eindex - 1.
Then it calls the function saiki recursively with the substring of the string S starting from index eindex and ending at the last index of the string S.
If the function saiki returns true for both calls, it returns true.
If the function saiki returns false for both calls, it returns false.
