The variable n is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger n falls within the range [1, 10]. If it does, it adds 1 to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 10.
