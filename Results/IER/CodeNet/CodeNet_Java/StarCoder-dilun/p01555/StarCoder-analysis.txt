The variable s is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable upper is less than or equal to the value of variable lower.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable med as the average of the values of variable upper and variable lower.
Then it calculates the value of variable dist as the number of integers less than or equal to the value of variable med that are divisible by 3, 5 or 15.
If the value of variable dist is greater than the value of variable s, then the value of variable upper is set to the value of variable med.
If the value of variable dist is less than the value of variable s, then the value of variable lower is set to the value of variable med.
If the value of variable dist is equal to the value of variable s, then the value of variable upper is set to the value of variable med and the value of variable lower is set to the value of variable med minus 1.
After the while loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from the value of variable lower to the value of variable upper.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable cur as the sum of the number of integers less than or equal to the current interger i that are divisible by 3, 5 or 15.
Then it checks if the current interger i is divisible by 15. If it is, it prints "FizzBuzz".
Else if the current interger i is divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz".
Else if the current interger i is divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz".
Else it prints the value of current interger i.
