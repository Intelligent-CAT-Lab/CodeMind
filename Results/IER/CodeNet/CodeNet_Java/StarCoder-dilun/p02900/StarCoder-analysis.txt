The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
The array a is initialized with 5 elements.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range.
The for loop iterates from i+1 to 4 to check each integer j in this range.
If the value of a[i] is greater than a[j], then the values of a[i] and a[j] are swapped.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range.
The variable max is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range.
If the value of a[i] is greater than the value of max, then the value of a[i] is assigned to max.
The value of max is printed as output.
