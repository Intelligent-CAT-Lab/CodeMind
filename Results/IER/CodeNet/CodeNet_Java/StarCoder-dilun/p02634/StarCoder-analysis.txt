The variable A, B, C and D are initialized with 1, 1, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable cell is initialized with 2x2 matrix filled with 0.
The variable MOD is initialized with 998244353.
The variable val is initialized with 0.
The variable i is initialized with 1.
The variable j is initialized with 1.
The for loop iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of cell[i][j] by multiplying the value of cell[i - 1][j] with j and adding it to cell[i][j].
Then it calculates the value of cell[i][j] by multiplying the value of cell[i][j - 1] with i and adding it to cell[i][j].
Then it calculates the value of cell[i][j] by multiplying the value of cell[i - 1][j - 1] with i and j and adding it to val.
Then it calculates the value of cell[i][j] by subtracting val from cell[i][j] and adding MOD.
Then it calculates the value of cell[i][j] by adding cell[i - 1][j] and adding cell[i][j - 1] and adding cell[i - 1][j - 1] and adding MOD.
Then it prints the final value of cell[C - 1][D - 1] as output, which is 2.
