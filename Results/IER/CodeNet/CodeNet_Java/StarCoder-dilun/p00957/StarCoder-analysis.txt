The variable n and variable k are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable dp is initialized with n columns. The first row is initialized with 1 and the second row is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
