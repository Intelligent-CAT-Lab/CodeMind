The variable n is initialized with 5.
It initializes an array of integers with length of n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it initializes an integer variable sum with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from i to n to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it adds the element at index j of the array arr to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is greater than the variable max. If it is, it sets the variable max to the calculated variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable max as output, which is 15.
