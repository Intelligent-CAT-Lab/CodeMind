The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the while loop, it reads the next line of input and splits it into an array of strings. Then it converts the strings in the array to integers and stores them in the array list.
After the loop finishes, it initializes variable max with the first element of the array list.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is greater than the variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the current interger i.
After the loop finishes, it initializes variable min with the first element of the array list.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
