The variable N is initialized with 10 and variable K is initialized with 4.
The condition K % 2 == 0 is met, so the code executes the first block of code.
The variable c1 is initialized with N / K, which is 10 / 4 = 2.5.
The variable c2 is initialized with N / (K / 2), which is 10 / 2 = 5.
The code prints the value of c1 * c1 * c1 + c2 * c2 * c2, which is 2.5 * 2.5 * 2.5 + 5 * 5 * 5 = 156.25.
