The input is read and stored in a variable n. The array arr is initialized with the size of n. The for loop iterates from 0 to n. The value of arr[i] is set to the value of the current interger i.
The array ans is initialized with the size of n. The for loop iterates from 0 to n. The variable count is initialized with 0. The for loop iterates from 0 to n. If the value of arr[i] is equal to the value of arr[j], the value of count is incremented by 1.
The value of ans[i] is set to the value of count.
The array ans is sorted in ascending order.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n. The value of ans[i] is printed.
