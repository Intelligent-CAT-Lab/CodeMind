The variable n, variable m and variable k are initialized with 3, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer l in this range. The value of variable l is also passed to variable num.
Inside the third for loop, it checks if the sum of the three integers i, j and l is equal to n. If it is, it adds 1 to variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 27.
