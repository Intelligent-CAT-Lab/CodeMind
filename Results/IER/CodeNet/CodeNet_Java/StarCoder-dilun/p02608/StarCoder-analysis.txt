The variable n is initialized with 20 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 100 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 100 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 100 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable num.
Inside the third for loop, it calculates the sum of the squares of the current interger i, j and k by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is greater than or equal to 100000. If it is, it skips the current interger i, j and k and continues to the next interger i, j and k.
After the third for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
