The variable n is initialized with 5.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of length 5.
The for loop is entered and it iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it reads the next integer from the input and stores it in arr[i].
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from i+1 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if arr[i] is greater than arr[j]. If it is, it swaps the values of arr[i] and arr[j].
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if arr[i] is greater than the current value of max. If it is, it updates the value of max with the value of arr[i].
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of max as output.
<<<Output>>>
5
