The variable N is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 6 to 55555 by adding 5 to the current interger i.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is prime or not.
If it is, it prints the current interger i and increases the value of variable count by 1.
If the value of variable count is equal to the value of variable N, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 5.
