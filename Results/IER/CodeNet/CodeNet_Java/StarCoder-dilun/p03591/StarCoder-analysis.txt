The variable s is initialized with the input.
It initializes variable count with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index j of variable s is equal to 'a'. If it is, it increments variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 3.
