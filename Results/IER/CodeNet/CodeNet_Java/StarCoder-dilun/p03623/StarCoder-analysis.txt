The variable x is initialized with 12 according to the input.
The variable a is initialized with 2 according to the input.
The variable b is initialized with 6 according to the input.
The modulo of x and a is calculated and compared with the modulo of x and b.
If the modulo of x and a is equal to 0 and the modulo of x and b is equal to 0, then the output is YES.
If the modulo of x and a
