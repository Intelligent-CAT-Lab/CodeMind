The variable n and variable k are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by variable k. If it is, it increments the value of variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
