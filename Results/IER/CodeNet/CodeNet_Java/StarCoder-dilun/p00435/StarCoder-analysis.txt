The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 10, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by variable a or variable b. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable c.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable c as output, which is 23.
