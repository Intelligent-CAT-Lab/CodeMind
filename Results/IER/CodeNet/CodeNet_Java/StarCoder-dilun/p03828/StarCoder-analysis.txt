The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum value of dp[j] where j is less than i.
Then it calculates the dp[i] as the maximum value of dp[j] plus 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of dp[n - 1] as output, which is 4.
