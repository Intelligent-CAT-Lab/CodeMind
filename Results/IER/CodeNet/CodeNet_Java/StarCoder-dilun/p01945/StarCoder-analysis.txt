The variable str is initialized with the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the variable str contains the substring "()". If it does, it replaces the substring "()" with an empty string.
It then converts the variable str to an array of characters and it finds the index of the first occurrence of the character '*'.
It then initializes two variables, left and right, with the index of the character '*' minus 1 and the index of the character '*' plus 1 respectively.
It then initializes a variable result with 0.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the character at the index left is '('. If it does, it enters another while loop and it checks if the character at the index right is ')'. If it does, it increments the variable result by 1.
It then decrements the variable left by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 2.
