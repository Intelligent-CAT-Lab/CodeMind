The variable a, b and c are initialized with 123, 456 and 789 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of a100, a10 and a1 by dividing a by 100, 10 and 1 respectively.
It calculates the value of b100, b10 and b1 by dividing b by 100, 10 and 1 respectively.
It calculates the value of c100, c10 and c1 by dividing c by 100, 10 and 1 respectively.
Then it checks if the calculated variables a100, b100 and c100 are equal. If they are, it adds the value of a100 to variable ans.
Then it checks if the calculated variables a100, b100 and c100 are equal. If they are not, it adds the value of a100 to variable ans.
Then it checks if the calculated variables a100, b100 and c100 are equal. If they are not, it adds the value of a100 to variable ans.
Then it checks if the calculated variables a100, b100 and c100 are equal. If they are not, it adds the value of a100 to variable ans.
Then it checks if the calculated variables a10, b10 and c10 are equal. If they are, it adds the value of a10 to variable ans.
Then it checks if the calculated variables a10, b10 and c10 are equal. If they are not, it adds the value of a10 to variable ans.
Then it checks if the calculated variables a10, b10 and c10 are equal. If they are not, it adds the value of a10 to variable ans.
Then it checks if the calculated variables a10, b10 and c10 are equal. If they are not, it adds the value of a10 to variable ans.
Then it checks if the calculated variables a1, b1 and c1 are equal. If they are, it adds the value of a1 to variable ans.
Then it checks if the calculated variables a1, b1 and c1 are equal. If they are not, it adds the value of a1 to variable ans.
Then it checks if the calculated variables a1, b1 and c1 are equal. If they are not, it adds the value of a1 to variable ans.
Then it checks if the calculated variables a1, b1 and c1 are equal. If they are not, it adds the value of a1 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 123.
