he variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The variable answer is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from A to N to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it converts the integer i to a string and stores it in variable char_ary.
Then it initializes variable sum with 0 and variable add_flg with true.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        sc.close();

        int answer = 0;

        for (int i = A; i <= N; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = i; j > 0; j /= 10) {
                sum += j % 10;
            }
            if (sum >= A && sum <= B) {
                answer += i;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(answer);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 20,
