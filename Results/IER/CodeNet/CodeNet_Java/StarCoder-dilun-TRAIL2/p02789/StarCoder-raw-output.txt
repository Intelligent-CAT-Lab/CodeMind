he variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if n is equal to m. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
    int n=sc.nextInt();
    int m=sc.nextInt();
    if (n==m) {
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }
    else{
      System.out.println("No");
    }
 
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
