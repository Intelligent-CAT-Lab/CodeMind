e variable s is initialized with the input string "CODEFESTIVAL".
The substring method is called on variable s with the arguments 0 and 4. The substring method returns the substring of s starting at index 0 and ending at index 4.
The substring method is called on variable s with the arguments 4 and 8. The substring method returns the substring of s starting at index 4 and ending at index 8.
The output is the concatenation of the two substrings, which is "CODE FESTIVAL".
<<<Output>>>
