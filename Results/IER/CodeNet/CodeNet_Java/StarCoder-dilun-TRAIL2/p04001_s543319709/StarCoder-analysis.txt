he variable S is initialized with the input string "125".
The variable n is initialized with the length of the input string minus 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2^n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it creates a new string builder object sb and copies the value of variable S to sb.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from n-1 to 0 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the bit of variable i at position j is 1. If it is, it inserts a "+" character at position j+1 of sb.
After the loop finishes, it splits the string in sb by the "+" character and stores the result in an array of strings s.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the array s to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it parses the string in s at position k to a long integer and adds it to variable res.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 15.
