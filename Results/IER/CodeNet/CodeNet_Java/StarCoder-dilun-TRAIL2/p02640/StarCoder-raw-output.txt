 variable x is initialized with 3 and variable y is initialized with 8.
Then it calculates the value of variable crane by using the formula -(y/2) + 2*x.
Then it calculates the value of variable turtle by using the formula x - crane.
Then it checks if the calculated values of variable crane and turtle are positive integers.
If they are, it prints "Yes" as output.
If they are not, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.Integer; 

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int x = sc.nextInt(); // 頭数
    int y = sc.nextInt(); // 足の数
    int crane = -(y/2) + 2*x;
    int turtle = x - crane;
    if(turtle < 0 || crane < 0 || turtle % 1!= 0 || crane % 1!= 0 ){
      System.out.println("No");
    }else{
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
