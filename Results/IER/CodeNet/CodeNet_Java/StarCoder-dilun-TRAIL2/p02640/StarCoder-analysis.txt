variable x is initialized with 3 and variable y is initialized with 8.
Then it calculates the value of variable crane by using the formula -(y/2) + 2*x.
Then it calculates the value of variable turtle by using the formula x - crane.
Then it checks if the calculated values of variable crane and turtle are positive integers.
If they are, it prints "Yes" as output.
If they are not, it prints "No" as output.
