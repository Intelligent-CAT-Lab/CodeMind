he variable x and variable y are initialized with 10 and 20 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans1 is initialized with 0.
The variable ans2 is initialized with 0.
The variable ans3 is initialized with 0.
The variable ans4 is initialized with 0.
The variable x1 is initialized with the value of variable x.
The variable x2 is initialized with the value of variable x multiplied by -1.
The variable y1 is initialized with the value of variable y.
The variable y2 is initialized with the value of variable y multiplied by -1.
The if statement checks if the value of variable x1 is less than or equal to the value of variable y1. If it is, it assigns the absolute value of the difference of the value of variable y1 and the value of variable x1 to variable ans1.
The else statement checks if the value of variable x2 is less than or equal to the value of variable y1. If it is, it assigns the absolute value of the difference of the value of variable y1 and the value of variable x2 to variable ans2 and adds 1 to it.
The else statement checks if the value of variable x1 is less than or equal to the value of variable y2. If it is, it assigns the absolute value of the difference of the value of variable y2 and the value of variable x1 to variable ans3 and adds 1 to it.
The else statement checks if the value of variable x2 is less than or equal to the value of variable y2. If it is, it assigns the absolute value of the difference of the value of variable y2 and the value of variable x2 to variable ans4 and adds 2 to it.
The variable ans is initialized with the minimum of the values of variables ans1, ans2, ans3 and ans4.
The variable ans is printed as output.
