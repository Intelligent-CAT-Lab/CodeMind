he variable N is initialized with 4 and variable x is initialized with 4.
It checks if x is either 1 or 2*N-1. If it is, it prints "No" as output.
Otherwise, it prints "Yes" as output.
Then it calls the function solve(N,x) to calculate the output.
Inside the function, it initializes an array ans with length 2*N-1.
Then it checks if x is 2. If it is, it sets the values of ans as follows:
```
ans[N-2] = 2*N-1;
ans[N-1] = 2;
ans[N]   = 1;
ans[N+1] = 2*N-2;
```
Then it initializes variable elm with 3.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2*N-1 to check each index i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of ans[i] is 0. If it is, it sets the value of ans[i] to variable elm and increments variable elm by 1.
After the loop finishes, it returns the array ans as output.
