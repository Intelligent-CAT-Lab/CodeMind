he variable n is initialized with 7 and variable k is initialized with 4.
The code checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 and exits the program.
If n is not equal to 0, it checks if n is greater than or equal to k. If it is, it checks if n is divisible by k. If it is, it prints 0 and exits the program.
If n is not divisible by k, it checks if k is greater than or equal to n divided by 2. If it is, it prints the absolute value of n minus k and exits the program.
If k is not greater than or equal to n divided by 2, it prints n and exits the program.
