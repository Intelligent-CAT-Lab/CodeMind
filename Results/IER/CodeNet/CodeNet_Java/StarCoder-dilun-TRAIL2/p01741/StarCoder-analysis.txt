he variable d is initialized with 1.000 according to the input.
It checks if d is less than 1. If it is, it prints d * Math.sqrt(2) as output.
It checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2). If it is, it prints 2 as output.
It checks if d is less than 2. If it is, it prints d * Math.sqrt(2) as output.
It checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2) * 1.5. If it is, it prints 3 as output.
It checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2) * 1.5. If it is, it prints d * Math.sqrt(2) as output.
After the checks, it prints d * Math.sqrt(2) as output.
