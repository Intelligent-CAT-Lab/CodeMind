he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 11 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates while variable b is greater than or equal to variable a.
Inside the while loop, it increments variable count by 1.
Then it decrements variable b by variable a.
Then it checks if variable count is greater than or equal to variable c. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		int count = 0;

		while (b >= a) {
			count++;
			b -= a;
			if (count >= c) {
				break;
			}
		}
		System.out.print(count);

	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 11 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
