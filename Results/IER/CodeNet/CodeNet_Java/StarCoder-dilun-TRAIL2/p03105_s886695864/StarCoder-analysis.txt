he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 11 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates while variable b is greater than or equal to variable a.
Inside the while loop, it increments variable count by 1.
Then it decrements variable b by variable a.
Then it checks if variable count is greater than or equal to variable c. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
