e variable x and variable y are initialized with 8 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if x is divisible by y. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints x.
<<<Output>>>
-1
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int x = sc.nextInt();
		int y = sc.nextInt();

		System.out.println(x % y == 0? -1 : x );

		sc.close();
	}
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
