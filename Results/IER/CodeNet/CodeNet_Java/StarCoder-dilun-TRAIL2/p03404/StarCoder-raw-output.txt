he variable a is initialized with 2 and variable b is initialized with 3.
It initializes a 98x99 grid with all values set to '#'.
It fills the first 49 rows with '.' and the last 49 rows with '.'.
It fills the first 2 columns with '.' and the last 2 columns with '#'.
It prints the dimensions of the grid as 98 99.
It prints the grid as a 98x99 grid.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main {
	static Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
 
	public static void main(String[]$) {
		int n = scanner.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = scanner.nextInt();
		}
		int[] dp = new int[n];
		dp[0] = arr[0];
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1] + arr[i], arr[i]);
		}
		System.out.println(Arrays.stream(dp).max().getAsInt());
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
It initializes an array of size n with all values set to 0.
It initializes an array of size n with all values set to 0.
It calculates the maximum value of the array dp by iterating from 0 to n - 1.
It calculates the maximum value of the array dp by iterating from 0 to n - 1.
It prints the maximum value of the
