TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Main().run();
    }

    private void run() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int S = scanner.nextInt();
        int ans = S * S* S;


        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
