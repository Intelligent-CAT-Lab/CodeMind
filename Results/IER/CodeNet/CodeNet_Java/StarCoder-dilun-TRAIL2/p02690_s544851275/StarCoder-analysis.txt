he variable X is initialized with 33.
It creates a 1000-element array fiveExp and initializes it with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 999 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable fiveExp[i].
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable fiveExp[i].
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable work by subtracting fiveExp[j] from variable X.
Then it checks if the calculated variable work equals to fiveExp[i]. If it does, it sets the value of variables A and B to i and j * (-1) respectively.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl values of variables A and B as output, which is 100 and -100.
