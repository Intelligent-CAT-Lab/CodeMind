he variable X is initialized with 33.
It creates a 1000-element array fiveExp and initializes it with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 999 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable fiveExp[i].
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable fiveExp[i].
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable work by subtracting fiveExp[j] from variable X.
Then it checks if the calculated variable work equals to fiveExp[i]. If it does, it sets the value of variables A and B to i and j * (-1) respectively.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl values of variables A and B as output, which is 100 and -100.
<<<Output>>>
100 -100

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
      // 入力
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int N = sc.nextInt();
      
      // 配列の作成
      int[] arr = new int[N];
      for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
        arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
      }
      
      // 配列のソート
      Arrays.sort(arr);
      
      // 出力
      System.out.println(arr[N - 1] - arr[0]);
    }

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5.
It creates a N-element array arr and initializes it with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is
