he variable r, variable g and variable b are initialized with 4, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the sum of the variables r, g and b and stores it in variable sum.
Then it checks if the remainder of the division of variable sum by 4 is equal to 0. If it is, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=scan.nextInt();
        int a=scan.nextInt();
        int b=scan.nextInt();
 
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            sum=sum+a;
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
 
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
