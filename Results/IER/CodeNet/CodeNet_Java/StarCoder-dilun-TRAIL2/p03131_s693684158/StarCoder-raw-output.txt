he variable k, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 2 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the difference between variable B and variable A is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints 1+k as output.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable kk as k-(A-1). Then it calculates the value of variable ans as kk/2*(B-A)+A.
If kk is odd, it adds 1 to variable ans.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable ans as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
     
      Scanner in =new Scanner(System.in);
      int k=in.nextInt();
      int A=in.nextInt();
      int B=in.nextInt();
      
      if  (B-A<=2) System.out.println(1+k);
      else{
        long kk=k-(A-1);
        long ans=kk/2*(B-A)+A;
        if (kk%2!=0)ans++;
        System.out.println(ans);
      }
      return;
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
