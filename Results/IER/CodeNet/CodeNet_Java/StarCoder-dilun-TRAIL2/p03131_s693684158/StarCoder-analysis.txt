he variable k, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 2 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the difference between variable B and variable A is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints 1+k as output.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable kk as k-(A-1). Then it calculates the value of variable ans as kk/2*(B-A)+A.
If kk is odd, it adds 1 to variable ans.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable ans as output.
