e variable K is initialized with 3 and variable X is initialized with 7.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from X - K + 1 to X + K - 1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is not equal to X + K - 1. If it is not, it prints the current interger i with a space in between.
If it is, it prints the current interger i without a space in between.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable i as output, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7 8 9

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int X = sc.nextInt();

		for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
			if (i % X == 0) {
				System.out.println(i);
			}
		}
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10 and variable X is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to N to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by X. If it is, it prints the current interger i.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable i as output, which is 3, 6 and 9.
<<<Output>>>
