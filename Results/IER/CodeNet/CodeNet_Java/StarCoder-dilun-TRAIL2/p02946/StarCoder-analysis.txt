e variable K is initialized with 3 and variable X is initialized with 7.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from X - K + 1 to X + K - 1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is not equal to X + K - 1. If it is not, it prints the current interger i with a space in between.
If it is, it prints the current interger i without a space in between.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable i as output, which is 7.
