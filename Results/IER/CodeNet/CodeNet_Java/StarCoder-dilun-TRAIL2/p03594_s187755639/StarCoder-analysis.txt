e variable n, variable m and variable d are initialized with 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable l.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable l by adding 2*d to variable l and then modding it with 2*d.
Then it calculates the value of variable col by dividing variable k by d and multiplying it with 2. Then it adds the value of variable l divided by d to it.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable col as output, which is R.
