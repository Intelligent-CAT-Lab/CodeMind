e variable n is initialized with 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a[i].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the quotient of the current interger n divided by the current interger a[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] a = {25, 10, 5, 1};
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            if (n!= 0) {
                count += n / a[i];
                n %= a[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
