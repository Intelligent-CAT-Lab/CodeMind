e variable n is initialized with 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a[i].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the quotient of the current interger n divided by the current interger a[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 10.
