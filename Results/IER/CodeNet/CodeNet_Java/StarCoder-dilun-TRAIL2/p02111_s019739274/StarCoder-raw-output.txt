he variable n is initialized with 0.
The value of variable n is divided by 30 and the remainder is stored in variable ans1.
The value of variable n is modulus 30 and the result is stored in variable ans2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans1 and ans2 as output, which is 0 0.
<<<Output>>>
0 0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String ar[]){
        Scanner cin=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=cin.nextInt();
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            if(n%i==0) ans++;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
