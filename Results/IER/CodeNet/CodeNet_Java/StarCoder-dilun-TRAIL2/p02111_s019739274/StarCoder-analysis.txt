he variable n is initialized with 0.
The value of variable n is divided by 30 and the remainder is stored in variable ans1.
The value of variable n is modulus 30 and the result is stored in variable ans2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans1 and ans2 as output, which is 0 0.
