he variable n is initialized with 30.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 30 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints the current interger i.
If it is not, it enters a while loop and it iterates until the current interger x is 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current interger x is divisible by 10. If it is, it prints the current interger i.
If it is not, it divides the current interger x by 10.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
