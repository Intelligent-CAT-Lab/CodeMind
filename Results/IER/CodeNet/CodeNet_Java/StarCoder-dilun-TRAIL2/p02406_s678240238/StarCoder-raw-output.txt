he variable n is initialized with 30.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 30 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints the current interger i.
If it is not, it enters a while loop and it iterates until the current interger x is 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current interger x is divisible by 10. If it is, it prints the current interger i.
If it is not, it divides the current interger x by 10.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
<<<Output>>>
3 13 23 33 113 123 133 213 223 233 313 323 333

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	@SuppressWarnings("resource")
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		call(new Scanner(System.in).nextInt());
	}

	static void call(int n) {
		for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
			int x = i;
			if (x % 3 == 0) {
				System.out.print(" " + i);
			} else {
				while (true) {
					if (x % 10 == 3) {
						System.out.print(" " + i);
						break;
					}
					
					x /= 10;
					if (x == 0) {
						break;
					}
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println();
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```30
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
