he variable S is initialized with the input string "ASSA".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string S. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the map m contains the key c. If it does not, it adds the key c and value 1 to the map m.
If the map m contains the key c, it adds the value of the key c to the value of the key c in the map m.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the size of the map m is 2. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
If the size of the map m is not 2, it prints "No" as output.
