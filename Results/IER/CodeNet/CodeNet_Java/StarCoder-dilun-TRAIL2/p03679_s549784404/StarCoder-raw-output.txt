he variable X is initialized with 4, variable A is initialized with 3 and variable B is initialized with 6.
The if statement checks if B is less than or equal to A. If it is, it prints the string "delicious".
The else if statement checks if B minus A is less than or equal to X. If it is, it prints the string "safe".
The else statement prints the string "dangerous".
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
	public class Main
		{ public static void main(String[] args)
			{   
			    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
			    int X = scanner.nextInt();
			    int A = scanner.nextInt();
			    int B = scanner.nextInt();
			    
			    if (B <= A) {
			    	System.out.println("delicious");
			    } else if ((B-A) <= X) {
			    	System.out.println("safe");
			    } else {
			    	System.out.println("dangerous");
			    }
		}
		}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 3 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
