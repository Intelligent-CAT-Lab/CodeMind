he variable x and variable y are initialized with 10 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It checks if x is less than or equal to y. If it is, it calculates the minimum of the difference between y and x and stores it in variable ans.
It checks if -x is less than or equal to y. If it is, it calculates the minimum of the difference between y and -x and stores it in variable ans.
It checks if x is less than or equal to -y. If it is, it calculates the minimum of the difference between -y and x and stores it in variable ans.
It checks if -x is less than or equal to -y. If it is, it calculates the minimum of the difference between -y and -x and stores it in variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

		String str[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

		long x = Long.parseLong(str[0]);
		long y = Long.parseLong(str[1]);

		long ans = Long.MAX_VALUE;
		if (x <= y)
			ans = Math.min(ans, y - x);
		if (-x <= y)
			ans = Math.min(ans, y + x + 1);
		if (x <= -y)
			ans = Math.min(ans, -y - x + 1);
		if (-x <= -y)
			ans = Math.min(ans, -y + x + 2);
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code
