he variable x and variable y are initialized with 10 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It checks if x is less than or equal to y. If it is, it calculates the minimum of the difference between y and x and stores it in variable ans.
It checks if -x is less than or equal to y. If it is, it calculates the minimum of the difference between y and -x and stores it in variable ans.
It checks if x is less than or equal to -y. If it is, it calculates the minimum of the difference between -y and x and stores it in variable ans.
It checks if -x is less than or equal to -y. If it is, it calculates the minimum of the difference between -y and -x and stores it in variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 11.
