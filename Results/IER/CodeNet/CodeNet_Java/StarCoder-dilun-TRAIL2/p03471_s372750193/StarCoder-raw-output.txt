he variable n is initialized with 9 and variable y is initialized with 45000.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the input stream is exhausted.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the number of 1000-dollar bills that can be purchased with variable y.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the calculated number of 1000-dollar bills.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of 500-dollar bills that can be purchased with variable y.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the calculated number of 500-dollar bills.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of 100-dollar bills that can be purchased with variable y.
Then it enters a if statement and it checks if the sum of the number of 1000-dollar bills, 500-dollar bills and 100-dollar bills is equal to variable n.
If it is, it prints the values of i, j and k as output.
If it is not, it prints -1 -1 -1 as output.
