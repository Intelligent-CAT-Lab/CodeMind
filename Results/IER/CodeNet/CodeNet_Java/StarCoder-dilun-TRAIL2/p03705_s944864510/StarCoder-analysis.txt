variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 4 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable a is greater than the value of variable b. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable n is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints the sum of the values of variables a and b multiplied by the value of variable n minus 1, minus the value of variable a multiplied by the value of variable n minus 1, plus 1 as output.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable a is equal to the value of variable b. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
Otherwise, it prints 0 as output.
