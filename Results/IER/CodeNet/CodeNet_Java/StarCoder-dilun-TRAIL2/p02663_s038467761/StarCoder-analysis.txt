he variable H1, variable M1, variable H2, variable M2 and variable K are initialized with 10, 0, 15, 0 and 30 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the difference between variable H2 and variable H1 and multiplies it by 60.
Then it calculates the difference between variable M2 and variable M1.
Finally, it calculates the difference between the two previous results and variable K.
