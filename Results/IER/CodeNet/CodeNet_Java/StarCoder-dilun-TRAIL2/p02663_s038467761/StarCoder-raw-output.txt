he variable H1, variable M1, variable H2, variable M2 and variable K are initialized with 10, 0, 15, 0 and 30 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the difference between variable H2 and variable H1 and multiplies it by 60.
Then it calculates the difference between variable M2 and variable M1.
Finally, it calculates the difference between the two previous results and variable K.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int N = sc.nextInt();
    int K = sc.nextInt();
    int[] arr = new int[N];
    for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
      arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
      if(arr[i]%K==0){
        ans++;
      }
    }
    System.out.println(ans);
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
Then it creates an array of size 5 and initializes each element with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by variable K. If it is, it adds 1 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
