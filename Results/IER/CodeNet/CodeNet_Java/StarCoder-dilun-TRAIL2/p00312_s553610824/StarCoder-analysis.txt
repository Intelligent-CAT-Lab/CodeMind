he variable D is initialized with 10 and variable L is initialized with 5.
The variable jump_time_L is initialized with the value of D divided by L.
The variable jump_time is initialized with the value of jump_time_L plus the value of D minus the value of L multiplied by jump_time_L.
After the initialization, it prints the value of jump_time as output, which is 3.
