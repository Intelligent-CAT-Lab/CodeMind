he variable D is initialized with 10 and variable L is initialized with 5.
The variable jump_time_L is initialized with the value of D divided by L.
The variable jump_time is initialized with the value of jump_time_L plus the value of D minus the value of L multiplied by jump_time_L.
After the initialization, it prints the value of jump_time as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int M = sc.nextInt();
        int K = sc.nextInt();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k < K; k++) {
                    if (i % 2 == 0 && j % 2 == 0 && k % 2 == 0) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3, variable M is initialized with 3 and variable K is initialized with 3.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable k.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to
