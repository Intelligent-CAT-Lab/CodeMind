e variable N, variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized with 4, 1, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The variable fact is initialized with an array of length 5. The first element of the array is initialized with 1.
The variable factInv is initialized with an array of length 5. The first element of the array is initialized with 1.
The variable comb is initialized with an array of length 5. The first element of the array is initialized with 1.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable b by subtracting A multiplied by i from variable K.
Then it checks if the calculated variable b is divisible by B. If it is, it divides the calculated variable b by B to get the value of variable b.
Then it checks if the calculated variable b is within the range [0, 4]. If it is, it adds the value of variable comb at index i to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
