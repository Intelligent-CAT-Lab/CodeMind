he variable w is initialized with the input string "abaccaba".
The variable c is initialized with the character array of w.
The variable acha is initialized with the integer value of character 'a'.
The variable zcha is initialized with the integer value of character 'z'.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the integer value of character 'a' to the integer value of character 'z' + 1.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates over the character array c.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current character x is equal to the current integer i.
If it is, it increments variable count by 1.
After the second for loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable count is odd.
If it is, it prints "No" as output and returns.
If it is not, it resets variable count to 0.
After the for loop finishes, it prints "Yes" as output.
