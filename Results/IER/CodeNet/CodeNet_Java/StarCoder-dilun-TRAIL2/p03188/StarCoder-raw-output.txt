riable k is initialized with 2.
It checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 and 1 as output.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable n by dividing k by 4 and multiplying the result by 2.
Then it creates a 2D array ret with n rows and n columns.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it assigns the value of (i % 2 == 0? 0 : n) + (i + j) % n to the element ret[i][j] of the 2D array ret.
The condition (i % 2 == 0? 0 : n) + (i + j) % n is true when i is even and false when i is odd.
The value of (i % 2 == 0? 0 : n) + (i + j) % n is 0 when i is even and n when i is odd.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the value of ret[i][j] is greater than or equal to k. If it is, it assigns the value of (ret[i][j]  - n) % k to the element ret[i][j] of the 2D array ret.
The condition (ret[i][j]  - n) % k is true when ret[i][j] is greater than or equal to k.
The value of (ret[i][j]  - n) % k is 0 when ret[i][j] is greater than or equal to k.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints the value of variable n as the first line of output.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it prints the value of (ret[i][j] + 1) to the output.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it prints a space to the output.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints a new line to the output.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the value of variable n as the first line of output.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it prints the value of (ret[i][j] + 1) to the output.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it prints a space to the output.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints a new line to the output.
