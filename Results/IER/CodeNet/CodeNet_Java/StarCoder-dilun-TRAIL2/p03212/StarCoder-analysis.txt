he variable N is initialized with 575.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the queue is empty. If it is not empty, it pops the first element of the queue and assigns it to variable s.
Then it checks if the value of variable s is less than or equal to variable N. If it is, it increments the value of variable count.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the array ch.
Inside the second for loop, it calls a method addChar to add a character c to the string s at the location i.
Then it checks if the string temp is already in the set. If it is not, it adds it to the set and the queue.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 10.
