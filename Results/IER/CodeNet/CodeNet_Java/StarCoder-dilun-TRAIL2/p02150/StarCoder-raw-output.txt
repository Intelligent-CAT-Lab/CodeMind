he variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 3, 1 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The variable s is initialized with a - b, which is 2.
The variable count is initialized with the maximum of x - a and 0, which is 4.
The variable total is initialized with the value of count % MOD * a % MOD, which is 4 * 3 % MOD, which is 12.
The variable x is subtracted by count * s, which is 4 * 2, which is 8.
The while loop is entered and it checks if x is greater than or equal to a. If it is, it adds a to variable total.
The while loop finishes and it prints the final value of variable total as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    static final int MOD = 1000000007;
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long a = sc.nextLong();
		long b = sc.nextLong();
		long x = sc.nextLong();
		long s = a - b;
		long count = Math.max(x - a, 0) / s;
		long total = (count % MOD) * (a % MOD) % MOD;
		x -= count * s;
		while (x >= a) {
		    total += a;
		    x += - a + b;
		}
		total += x;
		total %= MOD;
		System.out.println(total);
	}
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 3, 1 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The variable s is initialized with a - b, which is 2.
The variable count is initialized
