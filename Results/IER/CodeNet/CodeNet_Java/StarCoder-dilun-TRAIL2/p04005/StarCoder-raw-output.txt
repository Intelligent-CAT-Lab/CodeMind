he variable A, B and C are initialized with 3, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The array variable is initialized with the values of A, B and C.
The array is sorted in ascending order.
The if statement checks if any of the three values is even. If it is, then the output is 0.
If none of the values is even, then the output is the product of the first two values in the sorted array.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
 
class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int[] array = new int[N];
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			array[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
 
		int count = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++) {
				if (array[i] > array[j]) {
					count++;
				}
			}
		}
 
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input.
The array variable is initialized with N elements.
The for loop iterates from 0 to N-1 to initialize the array with the values of the input.
The for loop iterates from 0 to N-1 to check each pair of elements in the array.
If the first element is greater than the second element, then the variable count is incremented.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
