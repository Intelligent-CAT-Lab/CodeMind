he code first reads two integers from the input and stores them in variables a and b.
Then it divides the value of variable a by the value of variable b and prints the result.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedInputStream;
import java.math.BigInteger;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner in =new Scanner(new BufferedInputStream(System.in));
		while(in.hasNext())
		{
			BigInteger a = in.nextBigInteger(),b = in.nextBigInteger();
			System.out.println(a.mod(b));
		}
		in.close();
	}

}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers from the input and stores them in variables a and b.
Then it calculates the remainder of the value of variable a by the value of variable b and prints the result.
