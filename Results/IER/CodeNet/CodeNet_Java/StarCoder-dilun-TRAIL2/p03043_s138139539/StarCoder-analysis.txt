he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable p by dividing 1 by n. Then it calculates the value of variable tmp by multiplying i by 2.
Then it checks if the calculated variable tmp is less than k. If it is, it multiplies the value of variable p by 0.5.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 0.125.
