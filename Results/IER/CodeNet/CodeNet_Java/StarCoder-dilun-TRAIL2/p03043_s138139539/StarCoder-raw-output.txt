he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable p by dividing 1 by n. Then it calculates the value of variable tmp by multiplying i by 2.
Then it checks if the calculated variable tmp is less than k. If it is, it multiplies the value of variable p by 0.5.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 0.125.
<<<Output>>>
0.125

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();

        double ans = 0.0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

            double p = 1;
            int tmp = i;

            while (tmp < k) {
                p *= 0.5;
                tmp *= 2;
            }
            ans += p / n;
        }

        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 10.
