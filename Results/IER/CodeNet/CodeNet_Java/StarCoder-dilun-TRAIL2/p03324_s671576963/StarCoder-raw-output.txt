he variable a is initialized with 0 and variable b is initialized with 5.
The if statement checks if variable b is equal to 100. If it is, it changes the value of variable b to 101.
The if statement checks if variable a is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the value of variable b.
The else if statement checks if variable a is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of 100 * b.
The else statement prints the value of 10000 * b.
<<<Output>>>
5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		if(a == 0) System.out.println(b);
		else if(a == 1) System.out.println(100 * b);
		else System.out.println(10000 * b);
		
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 1 and variable b is initialized with 5.
The if statement checks if variable a is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the value of variable b.
The else if statement checks if variable a is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of 100 * b.
The else statement prints the value of 10000 * b.
<<<Output>>>
500
