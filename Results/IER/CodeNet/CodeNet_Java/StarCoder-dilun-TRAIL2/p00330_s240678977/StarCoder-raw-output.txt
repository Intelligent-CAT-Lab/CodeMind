he variable sc is initialized with a Scanner object that reads input from standard input.
The variable sc.nextInt() reads the next integer from standard input and returns it as an int.
The variable sc.nextInt()*32 is calculated by multiplying the value of sc.nextInt() by 32.
The variable sc.nextInt()*32 is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import static java.lang.System.*;

public class Main {
	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		out.println(sc.nextInt()*sc.nextInt());
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
