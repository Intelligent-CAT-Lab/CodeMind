he variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The value of variable k is calculated by subtracting variable b from variable a.
Then it checks if the value of variable k is odd or even. If it is odd, it prints "Borys". If it is even, it prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = in.nextInt();
		int a = in.nextInt();
		int b = in.nextInt();
		
		int k = b - a;
		if(k % 2 == 1) System.out.println("Borys");
		else System.out.println("Alice");
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
