he variable sc is initialized with a Scanner object.
The Scanner object is initialized with the input 3 4.
The Scanner object reads the first integer and stores it in variable a.
The Scanner object reads the second integer and stores it in variable b.
The code prints the product of a and b as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a+b);
    }
    
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
