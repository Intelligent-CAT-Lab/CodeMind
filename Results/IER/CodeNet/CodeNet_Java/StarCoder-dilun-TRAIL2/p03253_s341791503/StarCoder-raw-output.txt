he variable N is initialized with 2 and variable M is initialized with 6.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the size of the list unko is 0.
Inside the while loop, it gets the first element of the list unko and assigns it to variable a.
Then it checks if variable a is equal to 1. If it is not, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to variable counter.
Inside the for loop, it checks if variable a is equal to the first element of the i-th row of the 2D array map. If it is, it increments the second element of the i-th row of the 2D array map by 1.
If the condition is not met, it checks if variable a is equal to 1. If it is not, it assigns variable a to the first element of the i-th row of the 2D array map. It also increments the second element of the i-th row of the 2D array map by 1.
Then it increments variable counter by 1.
After the while loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to variable counter.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of the i-th element of the 2D array map by calling the function Combi(map[i][1]+N-1,N-1).
Then it multiplies the calculated value by the final value of variable ans.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
