he variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 1, 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable dx is initialized with the absolute value of the difference between a and c. The variable dy is initialized with the absolute value of the difference between b and d.
The variable ans is initialized with the value of the function help(Math.min(dx,dy),Math.max(dx,dy)).
The function help is called with the values of variables dx and dy.
The function help returns the value of the variable ans.
The value of variable ans is printed as output.
