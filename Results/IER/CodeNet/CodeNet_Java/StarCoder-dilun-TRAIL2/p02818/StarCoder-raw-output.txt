he variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized with 2, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if variable K is less than or equal to variable A. If it is, it subtracts variable K from variable A.
The else if statement checks if variable K is less than or equal to variable A+B. If it is, it subtracts variable K-A from variable B.
The else statement sets variable A and variable B to 0.
After the if, else if and else statements, it prints the values of variables A and B as output, which is 0 0.
<<<Output>>>
0 0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    static public void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        //BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        //String[] buf = reader.readLine().split(" ");
        long A = sc.nextLong(), B = sc.nextLong(), K = sc.nextLong();
        if(K<=A){
            A -= K;
        } else if(K <= A+B){
            B -= K-A;
            A = 0;
        } else {
            A = 0; B = 0;
        }
        System.out.println(A+" "+B);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized with 2, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if variable K is less than or equal to variable A. If it is, it subtracts variable K from variable A.
The else if statement checks if variable K is less than or equal to variable A+B. If it is, it subtracts variable K-A from variable B.
The else statement sets variable A and variable B to 0.
After the if, else if and else statements, it prints
