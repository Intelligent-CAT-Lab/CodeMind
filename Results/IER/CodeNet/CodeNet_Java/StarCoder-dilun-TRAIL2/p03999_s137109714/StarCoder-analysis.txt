riable k is initialized with the length of the input string S.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to k-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable d.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to k-i-1 to check each integer d in this range. The value of variable d is also passed to variable p.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable add by multiplying the value of variable p with the value of variable d.
Then it adds the value of variable add to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 125.
