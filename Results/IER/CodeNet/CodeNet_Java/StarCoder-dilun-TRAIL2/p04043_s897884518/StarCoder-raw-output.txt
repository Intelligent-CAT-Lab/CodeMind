he variable SideA, SideB and SideC are initialized with 5, 5 and 7 respectively according to the input.
Then an array arr is created with the values of variables SideA, SideB and SideC.
Then the array arr is sorted in ascending order.
Then it checks if the first element of the sorted array arr is 5, the second element is 5 and the third element is 7. If it is, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in); 
		
		int n = keyboard.nextInt();
		
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = keyboard.nextInt();
		}
		
		int max = arr[0];
		int min = arr[0];
		
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			if (arr[i] > max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
			if (arr[i] < min) {
				min = arr[i];
			}
		}
		
		System.out.println(max - min);
		
		keyboard.close();
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
Then an array arr is created with n elements.
Then a for loop is entered and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger arr[i] is greater than the variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the current interger
