he variable H1, variable M1, variable H2, variable M2 and variable K are initialized with 10, 0, 15, 0 and 30 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the start time by multiplying variable H1 by 60 and adding variable M1. The result is 600.
It calculates the end time by multiplying variable H2 by 60 and adding variable M2. The result is 900.
It calculates the difference between end time and start time by subtracting end time from start time. The result is 300.
It subtracts variable K from the difference calculated in the previous step. The result is 270.
It prints the final value of variable K as output, which is 270.
