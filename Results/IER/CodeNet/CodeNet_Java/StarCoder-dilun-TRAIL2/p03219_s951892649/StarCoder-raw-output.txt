he variable X is initialized with 81 and variable Y is initialized with 58.
The code enters a try-with-resources block and it creates a new Scanner object with the input stream of System.in.
Then it prints the sum of variable X and variable Y divided by 2 as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        try (Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in)) {
            int X = in.nextInt();
            int Y = in.nextInt();
            System.out.println(X + Y / 2);
        }
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```81 58
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
