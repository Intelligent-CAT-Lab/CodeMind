he variable H and variable W are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if H or W is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints 0 and returns.
Otherwise, it calculates the values of variables h1 and h2. If H is even, then h2 is equal to h1. Otherwise, h2 is equal to h1+1.
It calculates the values of variables w1 and w2. If W is even, then w2 is equal to w1. Otherwise, w2 is equal to w1+1.
It calculates the values of variables a1, a2 and a3.
The value of variable a1 is calculated by dividing W by 3. If the result is 0, then a1 is incremented by 1.
The value of variable a2 is calculated by multiplying (W-a1) by h1.
The value of variable a3 is calculated by multiplying (W-a1) by h2.
The value of variable cur is calculated by taking the maximum of a1*H, the maximum of a2 and a3 and subtracting the minimum of a1*H, the minimum of a2 and a3.
The value of variable a1 is incremented by 1.
The value of variable a2 is calculated by multiplying (W-a1) by h1.
The value of variable a3 is calculated by multiplying (W-a1) by h2.
The value of variable cur is calculated by taking the minimum of the value of variable cur, the maximum of a1*H, the maximum of a2 and a3 and subtracting the minimum of a1*H, the minimum of a2 and a3.
The value of variable a1 is incremented by 1.
The value of variable a2 is calculated by multiplying (W-a1) by h1.
The value of variable a3 is calculated by multiplying (W-a1) by h2.
The value of variable cur is calculated by taking the minimum of the value of variable cur, the maximum of a1*H, the maximum of a2 and a3 and subtracting the minimum of a1*H, the minimum of a2 and a3.
The value of variable cur is calculated by taking the minimum of the value of variable cur, the
