he variable s is initialized with the input.
The variable c is initialized with 0.
The variable d is initialized with the value of variable s.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger s by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable c.
Then it checks if the calculated variable c is divisible by variable d. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
If it is not, it prints "No" as output.
