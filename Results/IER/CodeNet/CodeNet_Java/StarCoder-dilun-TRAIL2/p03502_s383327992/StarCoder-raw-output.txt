he variable s is initialized with the input.
The variable c is initialized with 0.
The variable d is initialized with the value of variable s.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger s by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable c.
Then it checks if the calculated variable c is divisible by variable d. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
If it is not, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.nextLine();
		int c=0, d;
		d = Integer.valueOf(s);
		for(int i = 0;i < s.length();++i){
			c += s.charAt(i) - 48;
		}
		if(d % c == 0){
			System.out.println("Yes");
		}else{
			System.out.println("No");
		}
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```123
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
