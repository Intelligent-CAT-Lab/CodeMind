he variable s is initialized with the input string "aabbaa".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string s is equal to the next character of the string s. If it is, it increments variable i by 2.
If it is not, it checks if the current character of the string s is equal to the next character of the string s. If it is, it increments variable i by 1 and variable ans by 1.
Then it increments variable i by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 4.
