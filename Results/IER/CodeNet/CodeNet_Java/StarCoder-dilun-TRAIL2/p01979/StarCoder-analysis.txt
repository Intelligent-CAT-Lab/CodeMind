he variable numArr is initialized with the input.
The variable length is initialized with the length of the input.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of length length.
The variable dp is initialized with a 6-dimensional array of length length + 1.
The variable counts is initialized with a 2-dimensional array of length length + 1.
The for loop iterates from 1 to length to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters a nested for loop to check each integer a, b, c, d and e in this range. The value of variable a, b, c, d and e are also passed to variables b, c, d, e and f respectively.
Inside the nested for loop, it calculates the value of variable dp[i][b][c][d][e][0] by adding the value of dp[i - 1][a][b][c][d][0] to it.
Then it checks if the value of variable e is less than the value of variable arr[i - 1]. If it is, it adds the value of dp[i - 1][a][b][c][d][1] to the value of variable dp[i][b][c][d][e][0].
If the value of variable e is equal to the value of variable arr[i - 1], it adds the value of dp[i - 1][a][b][c][d][1] to the value of variable dp[i][b][c][d][e][1].
After the nested for loop finishes, it enters a nested for loop to check each integer e in this range. The value of variable e is also passed to variable j.
Inside the nested for loop, it calculates the value of variable counts[i][0] by adding the value of counts[i - 1][0] to it.
Then it checks if the value of variable e is less than the value of variable arr[i - 1]. If it is, it adds the value of counts[i - 1][1] to the value of variable counts[i][0].
If the value of variable e is equal to the value of variable arr[i - 1], it adds the value of counts[i - 1][1] to the value of variable counts[i][1].
After the nested for loop finishes, it enters a nested for loop to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable k.
Inside the nested for loop, it calculates the value of variable counts[i][0] by adding the value of dp[i][5][1][j][3][0] to it.
Then it calculates the value of variable counts[i][1] by adding the value of dp[i][5][1][j][3][1] to it.
After the nested for loop finishes, it sets the value of dp[i][5][1][j][3][0] to 0.
Then it sets the value of dp[i][5][1][j][3][1] to 0.
After the for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable counts[length][0] + counts[length][1] as output, which is 10.
