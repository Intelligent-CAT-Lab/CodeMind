variable str is initialized with the input string "ABCABC".
The variable a is initialized with 0.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the last character of the string to the first character of the string. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'X'. If it is, it adds 1 to variable a.
If the current character c is 'A', it adds the current value of variable a to variable ans.
If the current character c is neither 'X' nor 'A', it resets variable a to 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 4.
