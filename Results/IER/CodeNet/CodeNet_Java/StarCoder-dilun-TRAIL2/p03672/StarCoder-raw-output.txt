he variable s is initialized with the input string "abaababaab".
The variable s1 and s2 are initialized with empty strings.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the length of the string s to 2.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the first i characters of the string s and assigns it to variable S.
Then it extracts the first half of the string S and assigns it to variable s1.
Then it extracts the second half of the string S and assigns it to variable s2.
Then it checks if the string s1 is equal to the string s2 and if the length of the string S is not equal to the length of the string s.
If the condition is met, it assigns the string S to variable answer.
After the loop finishes, it print the length of the string answer as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int n = scan.nextInt();
		
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		
		for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
			arr[i] = scan.nextInt();
		}
		
		int max = arr[0];
		int min = arr[0];
		
		for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
			if(arr[i]>max){
				max = arr[i];
			}
			if(arr[i]<min){
				min = arr[i];
			}
		}
		
		System.out.println(max-min);
		
		
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer 5.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of length n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0
