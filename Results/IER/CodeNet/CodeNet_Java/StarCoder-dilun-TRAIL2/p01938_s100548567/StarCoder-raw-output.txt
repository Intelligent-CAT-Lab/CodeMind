he variable arr is initialized with the input string. The variable prev is initialized with 'A'. The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character c in the array arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character c is greater than or equal to the previous character prev. If it is, it adds 1 to variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int max = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > max) {
                max = arr[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized with the input integer. The variable arr is initialized with an array of size n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to the index of array arr.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the value of array arr at index i with the input integer.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to the index of array arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of array arr at index i is greater than the value of variable max. If it is, it updates the
