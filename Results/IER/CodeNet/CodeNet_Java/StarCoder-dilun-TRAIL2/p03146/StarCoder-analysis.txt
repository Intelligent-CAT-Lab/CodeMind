he variable s is initialized with 8.
The variable set is initialized with an empty set.
The variable i is initialized with 1.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the remainder of variable s divided by 2 is 0. If it is, it divides variable s by 2.
If the remainder is not 0, it multiplies variable s by 3 and adds 1 to it.
Then it checks if variable s is already in the set. If it is, it prints the value of variable i as output and returns.
If it is not, it adds variable s to the set and increments variable i by 1.
The while loop is exited and the value of variable i is printed as output.
