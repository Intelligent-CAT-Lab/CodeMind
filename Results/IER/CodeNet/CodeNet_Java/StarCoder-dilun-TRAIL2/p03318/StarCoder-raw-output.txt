e variable K is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int K = in.nextInt();
        long num = 0, d = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < K; i++)  {
            num += d;
            if(calc(num + 2 * d) < calc(num + d)) {
                d *= 10L;
            }
            System.out.println(num);
        }
    }
 
    public static double calc(long num) {
        double n = (double) num;
        double sum = 0;
        while(num!= 0L) {
            sum += num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return n / sum;
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
