he variable n is initialized with 6.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cnt.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger n is divisible by i. If it is, it increments the value of variable cnt by 1.
Then it checks if the value of variable cnt is greater than 0. If it is, it calculates the value of variable ans by repeatedlly multiplying the value of variable ans by i to the power of cnt.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120

import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt(),ans=1,cnt;
        for(int i=2;i<=n;i++){
            cnt=0;
            while(n%i==0){
                cnt++;
                n/=i;
            }
            if(cnt>0) ans*=(int)(Math.pow(i,cnt)-Math.pow(i,cnt-1));
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cnt.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger n is divisible by i. If it is, it increments the value of variable cnt by 1.
Then it checks if the value of variable cnt is greater than 0. If it is, it calculates the value of variable ans by repeatedlly multiplying the value of variable ans by i to the
