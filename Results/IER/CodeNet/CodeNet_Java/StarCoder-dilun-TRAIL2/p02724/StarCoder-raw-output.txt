he variable X is initialized with 1024 according to the input.
It calculates the number of 500s in variable X by dividing it by 500.
Then it calculates the number of 5s in variable X by dividing it by 5.
The final value of variable X is 1000*gohyaku+5*goen.
<<<Output>>>
200

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[]args) {
		try(Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in)){
			
			int X = scan.nextInt();
			
			int gohyaku = X/500;
			
			X = X-500*gohyaku;
			
			int goen = X/5;
			
			
			System.out.println(1000*gohyaku+5*goen);
		}
		
		
	}
		

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1024
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
