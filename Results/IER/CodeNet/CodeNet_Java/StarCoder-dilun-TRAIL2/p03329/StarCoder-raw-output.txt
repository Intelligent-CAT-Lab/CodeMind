e variable n is initialized with 127 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 127 to check each integer pow6 in this range. The value of variable pow6 is also passed to variable res.
Inside the for loop, it calls the function calc(n - pow6) to calculate the minimum value of the response of the remaining amount of money when the amount of money is reduced by pow6.
Then it calls the function calc(n - pow9) to calculate the minimum value of the response of the remaining amount of money when the amount of money is reduced by pow9.
The minimum value of the response of the remaining amount of money is calculated by the minimum value of the response of the remaining amount of money when the amount of money is reduced by pow6 and the minimum value of the response of the remaining amount of money when the amount of money is reduced by pow9.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	static final int MAX_N = 110000;
	static int[] memo = new int[MAX_N]; // memo[i]:i=Nのときの最低値
	static {
		Arrays.fill(memo, -1); // 初期化
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int ans = calc(n);
		System.out.println(ans);
	}

	static int calc(int n) {
		if (n == 0) return 0;
		if (memo[n]!= -1) return memo[n]; // メモ済みならその値を返す

		int res = n; // 1円ずつ引き出した場合 resはresponseのres?
		for (int pow6 = 1; pow6 <= n; pow6 *= 6) {
			res = Math.min(res, calc(n -
