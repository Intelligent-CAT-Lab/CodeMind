he variable N is initialized with 11.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100/7 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100/4 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the calculated variable N is equal to the sum of i and j. If it is, it prints "Yes" and returns.
After the loop finishes, it prints "No" as output.
