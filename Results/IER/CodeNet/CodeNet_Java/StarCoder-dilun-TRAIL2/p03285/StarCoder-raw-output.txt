he variable N is initialized with 11.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11/7 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable left.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable left by subtracting i*7 from variable N.
Then it checks if the calculated variable left is divisible by 4. If it is, it sets the value of variable check to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable check is true. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int limit7 = N / 7;
		boolean check = false;
		for (int i = 0; i <= limit7; i++) {
			int left = N-(i*7);
			if (left % 4 == 0) {
				check = true;
			}
		}
		if (check) {
		System.out.println("Yes");
		}
		else {
			System.out.println("No");
		}
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 12.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 12/7 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable left.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable left by subtracting i*7 from variable N.
Then it checks if the calculated variable left is divisible by 4. If it is, it sets the value of variable check to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable check is true.
