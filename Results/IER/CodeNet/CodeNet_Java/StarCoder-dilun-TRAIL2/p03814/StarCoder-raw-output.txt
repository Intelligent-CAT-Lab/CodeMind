he variable s is initialized with the string "QWERTYASDFZXCV" according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each character c in the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is equal to 'A'. If it is, it sets the value of variable from to i.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from n-1 to 0 to check each character c in the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is equal to 'Z'. If it is, it sets the value of variable to to i.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the difference between variable to and variable from and adds 1 to it.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable to - variable from + 1 as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
