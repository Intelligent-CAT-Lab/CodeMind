e variable overLimit is initialized with 4, variable prevDay is initialized with 3 and variable overDay is initialized with 6.
The code checks if prevDay is greater than or equal to overDay. If it is, it prints the string "delicious" as output.
If it is not, it checks if prevDay + overLimit is less than overDay. If it is, it prints the string "dangerous" as output.
If it is not, it prints the string "safe" as output.
<<<Output>>>
delicious

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Here your code!
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        String line = br.readLine();
        
        String[] tmpArray = line.split(" ");
        
        int n = Integer.parseInt(tmpArray[0]);
        int m = Integer.parseInt(tmpArray[1]);
        
        int[] array = new int[n];
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            array[i] = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
        }
        
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            sum += array[i];
        }
        
        int avg = sum / n;
        
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(array[i] > avg){
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
10
20
30
40
50
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5, variable m is initialized with 10.
The code creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check
