e variable overLimit is initialized with 4, variable prevDay is initialized with 3 and variable overDay is initialized with 6.
The code checks if prevDay is greater than or equal to overDay. If it is, it prints the string "delicious" as output.
If it is not, it checks if prevDay + overLimit is less than overDay. If it is, it prints the string "dangerous" as output.
If it is not, it prints the string "safe" as output.
