e variable y1, variable m1, variable d1 are initialized with 2015, 3 and 13 respectively according to the input.
The variable y2, variable m2, variable d2 are initialized with 2015, 3 and 13 respectively according to the input.
The variable y1s, variable y1a, variable c1 are initialized with 2015/400, 2015%400, 13 respectively according to the input.
The variable y2s, variable y2a, variable c2 are initialized with 2015/400, 2015%400, 13 respectively according to the input.
The variable result is initialized with System.out.
The method get13f is called with y1a, m1, d1 as parameters.
The method get13f is called with y2a, m2, d2 as parameters.
The value of variable c2 is subtracted from the value of variable c1.
The value of variable c2 is printed as output.
