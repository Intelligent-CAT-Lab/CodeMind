he variable a and variable b are initialized with 12 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is greater than 2 times b. If it is, it prints the difference between a and 2 times b. If it is not, it prints 0.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String line = sc.nextLine();
        String[] line1 = line.split(" ");
        int a = Integer.parseInt(line1[0]);
        int b = Integer.parseInt(line1[1]);
        if(a > 2 * b)   System.out.println(a - 2 * b);
        else System.out.println(0);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
