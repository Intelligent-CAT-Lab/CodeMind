he variable s is initialized with the input string.
The variable max is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'R'. If it is, it calculates the maximum value of the current substring by taking the difference between the current index i and the leftmost index left plus 1.
Then it updates the value of variable max with the maximum value calculated.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 3.
