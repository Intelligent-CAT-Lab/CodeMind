variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 0, 75, 25 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from variable a to variable b to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i falls within the range [c, d]. If it does, it adds 1 to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 25, 50, 75.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
