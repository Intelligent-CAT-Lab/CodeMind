he variable N is initialized with 3 and variable K is initialized with 2.
The variable dp is initialized with a 3x3x3 array.
The first dimension of dp is the number of integers in the input.
The second dimension of dp is the number of integers in the input that are smaller than the current integer.
The third dimension of dp is the number of integers in the input that are smaller than the current integer and are divisible by 2.
The value of dp[0][0][0] is 1.
The for loop iterates from 1 to N.
Inside the for loop, the for loop iterates from 0 to i.
Inside the for loop, the for loop iterates from 2 * j to K.
Inside the for loop, if j > 0, it adds the value of dp[i - 1][j - 1][k - 2 * j] to dp[i][j][k].
Inside the for loop, it adds (2 * j + 1) * dp[i - 1][j][k - 2 * j] to dp[i][j][k].
Inside the for loop, if j < N, it adds (j + 1) * (j + 1) * dp[i - 1][j + 1][k - 2 * j] to dp[i][j][k].
Inside the for loop, it prints the value of dp[N][0][K] as output.
