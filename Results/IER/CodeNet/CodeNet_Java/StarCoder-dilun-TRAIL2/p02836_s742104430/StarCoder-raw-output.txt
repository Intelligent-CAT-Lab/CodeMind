he variable S is initialized with the input string "redcoder".
The variable length is initialized with the length of the string S.
The variable c is initialized with the first character of the string S.
The variable d is initialized with the last character of the string S.
The variable cnt is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to length/2-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable d by subtracting i from length-1.
Then it checks if the current character c is not equal to the current character d. If it is not, it adds 1 to variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
