he variable n is initialized with 7 and variable k is initialized with 3.
The code checks if n is divisible by k. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int a = 0,b = 0,c = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            int x = sc.nextInt();
            if(x%2==0){
                a++;
            }else if(x%3==0){
                b++;
            }else{
                c++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(a+" "+b+" "+c);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if x is divisible by 2. If it is, it adds 1 to variable a.
Then it checks if x is divisible by 3. If it is, it adds 1 to variable b.
Then it checks if x is divisible by 2 and 3. If it is, it adds 1 to variable c.
After the loop finishes, it print the values of variables a, b and c as output, which is 3 2 1.
<<<Output>>>
3 2 1
