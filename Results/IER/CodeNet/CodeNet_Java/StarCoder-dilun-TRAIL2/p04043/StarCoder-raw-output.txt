he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 5, 5 and 7 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if the values of variables a, b and c are equal to 5, 5 and 7 respectively. If they are, it prints "YES" as output.
If the values of variables a, b and c are not equal to 5, 5 and 7 respectively, it enters the else statement.
The else statement checks if the values of variables a, b and c are equal to 5, 7 and 5 respectively. If they are, it prints "YES" as output.
If the values of variables a, b and c are not equal to 5, 7 and 5 respectively, it enters the else statement.
The else statement checks if the values of variables a, b and c are equal to 7, 5 and 5 respectively. If they are, it prints "YES" as output.
If the values of variables a, b and c are not equal to 7, 5 and 5 respectively, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
    	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int a = sc.nextInt();
      int b = sc.nextInt();
      int c = sc.nextInt();

      if(a== 5 && b == 7 && c ==5){
      	System.out.println("YES");
      }else if(a== 5 && b== 5 &&c ==7){
      	System.out.println("YES");
      }else if(a == 7 && b == 5&& c ==5){
      	System.out.println("YES");
      }else{
      	System.out.println("NO");
      }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are
