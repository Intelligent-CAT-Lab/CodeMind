TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    
		// 整数の入力
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
  
		// 出力
		System.out.println(a * b * c);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
