he variable a is initialized with 68 according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with (a - 30) / 2.
The value of variable sum is calculated by dividing the difference of variable a and 30 by 2.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable sum as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a,b,c,sum;
		a = scan.nextInt();
		b = scan.nextInt();
		c = scan.nextInt();
		
		sum = a + b + c;
		
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with a + b + c.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable sum as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
