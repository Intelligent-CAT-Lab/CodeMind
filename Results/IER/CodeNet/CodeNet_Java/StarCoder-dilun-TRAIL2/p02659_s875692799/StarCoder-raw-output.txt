he variable A is initialized with 198 and variable B is initialized with 1.10.
The code calculates the value of A*B and then divides it by 1.00 to get the value of A*B/1.00.
The value of A*B/1.00 is rounded to the nearest integer.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        int sum = 0;
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                int num = sc.nextInt();
                if (num >= a && num <= b) {
                        sum += num;
                        count++;
                }
        }

        System.out.println(sum);
        System.out.println(count);
    }

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger num falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger num to variable sum and increments variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl values of variables sum and count as output, which is 15 and 3.
<<<Output>>>
