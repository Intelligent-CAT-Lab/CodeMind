e variable N is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer l in this range. The value of variable l is also passed to variable N.
Inside the for loop, it subtracts the current interger l from variable N.
Then it checks if the calculated variable N is equal to the current interger l. If it is not, it prints "No" as output.
If it is, it prints "Yes" as output and it enters another for loop to print the answer.
The variable Index is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it appends the value of variable l to a string variable.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to i-1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable string.
Inside the for loop, it appends the value of answer[j][i-1] to string.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to l-1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable string.
Inside the for loop, it appends the value of answer[i][j]=Index++ to string.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of string as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int l;
		for(l=1; l<N; l++){
			N -= l;
		}
		if(N!= l){
			System.out.println("No");
			System.out.flush();
			return;
		}
		System.out.println("Yes");
		System.out.println(l+1);
		int[][] answer = new
