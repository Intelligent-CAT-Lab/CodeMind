he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a if statement to check if n is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 1.
Then it enters another if statement to check if n is equal to 1. If it is, it returns 2.
Then it enters another if statement to check if n is greater than 1.
Inside the if statement, it calculates the value of variable a by calling the solve method with parameter n/2.
Then it calculates the value of variable b by calling the solve method with parameter n/2-1.
Then it enters another if statement to check if n is odd.
Inside the if statement, it returns the value of (2*a + b) % 1000000007.
Otherwise, it returns the value of (2*b + a) % 1000000007.
After the if statement finishes, it returns the value of variable a as output.
