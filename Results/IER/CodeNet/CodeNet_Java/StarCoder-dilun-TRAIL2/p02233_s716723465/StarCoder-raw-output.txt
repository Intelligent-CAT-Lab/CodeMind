he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 45 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int[] arr = new int[45];
		arr[0]=1;
		arr[1]=1;
		
		for(int i=2;i<arr.length;i++)
		{
			arr[i]=arr[i-1]+arr[i-2];
		}
		
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(arr[n]);
	}
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
