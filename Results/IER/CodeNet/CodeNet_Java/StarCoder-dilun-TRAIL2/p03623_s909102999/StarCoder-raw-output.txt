he variable x, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 7 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the absolute value of the difference between x and a is greater than the absolute value of the difference between x and b.
If it is, it prints "A" as output.
If it is not, it prints "B" as output.
<<<Output>>>
A

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = sc.nextInt(), a = sc.nextInt(), b = sc.nextInt();
        String ans ="A";
        if(Math.abs(x - a) > Math.abs(x - b)) ans = "B";
        System.out.println(ans);
        }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 7
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
