he variable H is initialized with -3 and variable R is initialized with 3.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the absolute value of variable H is equal to variable R.
If it is, it prints 0 as output.
If it is not, it checks if the sum of variable H and variable R is greater than 0.
If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If it is not, it prints -1 as output.
<<<Output>>>
0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        while (sc.hasNextInt()) {
            int N = sc.nextInt();
            int M = sc.nextInt();
            int K = sc.nextInt();

            if ( N == M && M == K ) {
                System.out.println(1);
            } else if ( N == M || M == K || N == K ) {
                System.out.println(2);
            } else {
                System.out.println(0);
            }
        }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 1, variable M is initialized with 1 and variable K is initialized with 1.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the value of variables N, M and K are all equal.
If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If it is not, it checks if the value of variables N and M are equal or if the value of variables M and K are equal or if the value of variables N and K are equal.
If it is, it prints 2 as output.
If it is not, it prints 0 as output.
<<<Output>>>
1
