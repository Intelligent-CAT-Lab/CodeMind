he variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable now.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character i is '(' or ')'. If it is, it increments variable now by 1. If it is not, it decrements variable now by 1.
