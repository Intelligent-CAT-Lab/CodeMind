he variable s is initialized with the string "0011".
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character c in the string s. If the character c is equal to '0', it increments the variable numZeros by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable numZeros as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    int n = scanner.nextInt();
    int[] arr = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      arr[i] = scanner.nextInt();
    }
    int max = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
    }
    System.out.println(max);
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the integer 5.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger arr[i] is greater than the variable max. If it is, it updates the variable max with the value of arr[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
