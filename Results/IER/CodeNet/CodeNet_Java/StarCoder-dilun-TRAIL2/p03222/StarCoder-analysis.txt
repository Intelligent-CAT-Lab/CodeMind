he variable H, variable W and variable K are initialized with 1, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer h in this range. The value of variable h is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer w in this range. The value of variable w is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of dp[h+1][w+1] by adding the value of dp[h][w] multiplied by the number of vertical bars in the current position and the number of vertical bars in the next position.
Then it calculates the value of dp[h+1][w-1] by adding the value of dp[h][w] multiplied by the number of vertical bars in the current position and the number of vertical bars in the previous position.
Then it calculates the value of dp[h+1][w] by adding the value of dp[h][w] multiplied by the number of vertical bars in the current position and the number of vertical bars in the current position.
After the second for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of dp[1][2] as output, which is 1.
