s is initialized with the input string "aba".
The variable l is initialized with the length of the string s.
The if statement checks if the length of the string s is even or odd. If it is even, it checks if the first character of the string s is equal to the last character of the string s. If it is true, it prints "Second" as output. Otherwise, it prints "First" as output.
