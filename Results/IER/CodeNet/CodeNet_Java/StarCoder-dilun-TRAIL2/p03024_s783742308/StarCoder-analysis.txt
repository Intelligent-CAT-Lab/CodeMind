variable str is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string str. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'x'. If it is, it increments variable batsucount.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable batsucount is less than 8. If it is, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
