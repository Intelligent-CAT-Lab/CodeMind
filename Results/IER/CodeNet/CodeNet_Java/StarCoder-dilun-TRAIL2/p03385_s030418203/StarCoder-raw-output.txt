e variable string is initialized with the input.
It checks if the string contains the characters a, b and c.
If it does, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
    import java.util.Scanner;
     
    public class Main {
     
    	public static void main(String[] args) {
    		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    		String string = sc.nextLine();
    		boolean b = string.contains("a") || string.contains("b") || string.contains("c");
    		System.out.println(b? "Yes" : "No");
    	}
     
    }
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```bac
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
