he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ic2.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the integers from 1 to i. The value of variable ic2 is compared to variable n. If it is equal, it sets variable k to i.
If the value of variable ic2 is greater than variable n, it prints "No" as output.
If the value of variable ic2 is less than variable n, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to k - 1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger j to variable v. Then it adds the current interger j to the list of integers in the list of lists ansList.
After the loop finishes, it prints "Yes" as output.
After that, it prints the value of variable k as output.
After that, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to k - 1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it prints the value of variable k - 1 as output.
After that, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to k - 1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it prints the value of variable j as output.
After the loop finishes, it prints the list of integers in the list of lists ansList as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
		br.close();

		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = i + 1;
		}
