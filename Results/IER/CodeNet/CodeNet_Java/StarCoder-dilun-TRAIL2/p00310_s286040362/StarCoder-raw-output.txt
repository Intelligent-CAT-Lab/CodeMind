he variable sc is initialized with a Scanner object that reads input from standard input.
The Scanner object reads three integers from standard input and stores them in variables a, b and c respectively.
The code then prints the sum of the three variables a, b and c.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import static java.lang.System.*;

public class Main {
	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		out.println(a+b+c);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 10 20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
