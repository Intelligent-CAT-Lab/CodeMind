he variable N is initialized with 7 and variable K is initialized with 3.
The condition N % K == 0 is checked. Since N is not divisible by K, the condition is not met and variable ans is initialized with 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int N = sc.nextInt();
    int K = sc.nextInt();
    int ans;

    if(N % K == 0){
      ans = 0;
    }else{
      ans = 1;
    }

    System.out.println(ans);
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
