he variable X is initialized with 3 and variable Y is initialized with 20.
The variable A is initialized with the value of variable X.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable A is less than or equal to the value of variable Y.
If it is, it increments the value of variable ans by 1.
If it is not, it prints the value of variable ans as output and returns.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[N];
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int ans = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++) {
				if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
					int temp = arr[i];
					arr[i] = arr[j];
					arr[j] = temp;
				}
			}
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			ans += arr[i];
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}

}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5

```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5.
The array arr is initialized with 5 elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of arr[i] is greater than the value of arr[j].
If it is
