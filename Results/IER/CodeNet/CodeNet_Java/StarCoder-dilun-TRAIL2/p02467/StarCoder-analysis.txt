he variable n is initialized with 12.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of 12.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of variable n. If it is, it divides variable n by i and prints i.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable n as output, which is 12.
