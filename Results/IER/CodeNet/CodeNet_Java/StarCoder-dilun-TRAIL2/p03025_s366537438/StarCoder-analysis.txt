NO-ANSWER
variable N, variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized with 1, 25, 25 and 50 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N - 1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i and the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i and the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i and the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i and the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i and the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i and the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i and the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i and the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i and the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i and the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i and the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i and the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i and the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 + i, i and the number of combinations of N - 1 + i
