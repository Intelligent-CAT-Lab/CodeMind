e variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 8, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The value of variable n is divided by the sum of variable a and variable b. The result is stored in variable ans.
The value of variable n is divided by the sum of variable a and variable b. The remainder is stored in variable ans.
The minimum of variable a and variable ans is stored in variable ans.
The final value of variable ans is printed as output.
