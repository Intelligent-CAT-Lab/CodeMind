e variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 8, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The value of variable n is divided by the sum of variable a and variable b. The result is stored in variable ans.
The value of variable n is divided by the sum of variable a and variable b. The remainder is stored in variable ans.
The minimum of variable a and variable ans is stored in variable ans.
The final value of variable ans is printed as output.

        long b=sc.nextLong();
        long ans=0;
        ans=n/a+n/b-n/(a*b);
        System.out.println(ans);
       
        
    }

    static class FastScanner {
        BufferedReader br;

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 10, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The value of variable n is divided
