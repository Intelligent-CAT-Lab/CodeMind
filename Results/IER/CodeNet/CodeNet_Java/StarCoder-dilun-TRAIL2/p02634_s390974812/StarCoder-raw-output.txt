e variable A, B, C and D are initialized with 1, 1, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable DP is initialized with a 2D array of size C+1 x D+1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to C-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to D-1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable b.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable v by adding the product of variable b and the value of function solve(a+1, b) to variable v.
Then it adds the product of variable a and the value of function solve(a, b+1) to variable v.
Then it subtracts the product of variable a and variable b and the value of function solve(a+1, b+1) to variable v.
Then it adds the value of variable v to variable ov.
Then it modulos the value of variable v by 998244353 to get the final value of variable v.
Then it adds the value of variable v to 998244353 to get the final value of variable v.
Then it adds the value of variable v to variable DP[a][b].
Then it prints the final value of variable DP[A][B] as output, which is 1.
