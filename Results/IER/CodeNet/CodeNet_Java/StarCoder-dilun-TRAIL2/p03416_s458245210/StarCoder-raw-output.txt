he variable a and variable b are initialized with 11009 and 11332 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from a to b to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable _i.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the first and the fifth digits of the current interger _i are equal and the second and the fourth digits of the current interger _i are equal.
If the condition is met, it adds 1 to variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) {
      String _i = new String().valueOf(i);
      if (_i.charAt(0) == _i.charAt(1) && _i.charAt(1) == _i.charAt(2) && _i.charAt(2) == _i.charAt(3) && _i.charAt(3) == _i.charAt(4)) {
        count++;
      }
    }
    System.out.println(count);
  }

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11009 11332
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
