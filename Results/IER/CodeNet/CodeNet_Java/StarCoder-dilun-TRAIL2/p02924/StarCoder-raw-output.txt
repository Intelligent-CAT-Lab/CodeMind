he variable n is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 0 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable result. The condition is met when i is 1 and 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 3.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String args[]) {

        // 入力
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());

        // 主処理
        long result = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            result += i;
        }

        // 出力
        System.out.println(result);
        sc.close();
    }

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
