he variable N is initialized with 5.
The if statement checks if N is even or odd. If it is even, it divides N by 2 and prints the result. If it is odd, it adds 1 to the result of division and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.math.*;
 
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[]args)throws IOException
    {
         Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
         int N = sc.nextInt();
         int sum = 0;
         for(int i=1;i<=N;i++)
         {
              sum = sum + i;
         }
         System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
           

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5.
The for loop iterates from 1 to 5 and adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
