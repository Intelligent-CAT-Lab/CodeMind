he variable N is initialized with 3.
The variable n is initialized with 61 elements.
The variable dp is initialized with 61 rows and 3 columns.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 60 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable dp[i][2] by multiplying the value of dp[i + 1][2] by 3.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable dp[i][2] by adding the value of dp[i + 1][1] to it.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable dp[i][c] by adding the value of dp[i + 1][1] to it.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable dp[i][c] by adding the value of dp[i + 1][0] to it.
Then it calculates the value of variable ans by adding the value of dp[0][0] to it.
Then it calculates the value of variable ans by adding the value of dp[0][1] to it.
Then it calculates the value of variable ans by adding the value of dp[0][2] to it.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
