he variable S is initialized with the input string TSTTSS.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string S. The value of variable i is also passed to variable char.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character char is 'S'. If it is, it increments variable s by 1.
If the current character char is not 'S', it decrements variable s by 1.
If variable s is greater than 0, it increments variable count by 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 4.
