e variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is initialized with 6.
The variable res is initialized with the value of variable m.
The variable ans is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of variable res.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of times the current interger i divides variable res.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of n numbers out of i numbers by using the formula:
```C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)```
where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n numbers out of k numbers.
Then it multiplies the current value of variable ans with the calculated value of C(n, k) and stores the result in variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it checks if variable res is not equal to 1. If it is not, it calculates the number of combinations of n numbers out of 1 number by using the formula:
```C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)```
where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n numbers out of k numbers.
Then it multiplies the current value of variable ans with the calculated value of C(n, k) and stores the result in variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
