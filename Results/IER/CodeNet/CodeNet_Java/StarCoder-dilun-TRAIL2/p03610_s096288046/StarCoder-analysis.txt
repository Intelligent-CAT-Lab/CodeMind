he variable s is initialized with the input string "atcoder".
The variable sSplit is initialized with the string array of s.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is even. If it is, it prints the character at index i of the string array sSplit.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
