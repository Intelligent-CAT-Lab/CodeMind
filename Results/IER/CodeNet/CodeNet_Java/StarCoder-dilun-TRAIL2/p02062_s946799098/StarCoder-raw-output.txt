e variable S is initialized with the input.
The variable pos is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the current character at position pos is '&' or '|' or '(' or ')'.
Inside the while loop, it enters a if statement and it checks if the current character at position pos is '('.
Inside the if statement, it enters a recursive function parseOr() to parse the expression inside the parentheses.
After the recursive function parseOr() finishes, it enters a while loop and it checks if the current character at position pos is '&' or '|' or ')'.
Inside the while loop, it enters a if statement and it checks if the current character at position pos is '('.
Inside the if statement, it enters a recursive function parseAnd() to parse the expression inside the parentheses.
