he variable x is initialized with 6, variable k is initialized with 2 and variable d is initialized with 4.
The value of variable x is passed to variable rem.
The value of variable x is passed to variable quo.
If the value of variable k is less than the value of variable quo, then the value of variable x is subtracted by the product of the value of variable k and the value of variable d.
If the value of variable k is greater than or equal to the value of variable quo, then the value of variable rem is subtracted by the value of variable d.
If the value of variable k is even, then the value of variable rem is printed as output.
If the value of variable k is odd, then the value of variable v1 is printed as output.
