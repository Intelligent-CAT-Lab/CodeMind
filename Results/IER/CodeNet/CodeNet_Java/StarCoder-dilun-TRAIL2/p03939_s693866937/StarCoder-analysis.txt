he variable n, variable d and variable x are initialized with 1, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable F is initialized with 200001 elements with each element initialized with -1.
The variable G is initialized with 200001 elements with each element initialized with -1.
The variable F is filled with values according to the formula.
The variable G is filled with values according to the formula.
The final output is calculated by multiplying the value of variable F with variable x and adding the value of variable d multiplied by the value of variable G.
