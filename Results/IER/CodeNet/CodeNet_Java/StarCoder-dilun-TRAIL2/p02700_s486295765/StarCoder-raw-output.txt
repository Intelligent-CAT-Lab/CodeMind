he variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 10, 9, 10 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the values of variables a and c are greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it subtracts the value of variable d from variable a and it subtracts the value of variable b from variable c.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable c is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "No" as output. Otherwise, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int c = sc.nextInt();
    int d = sc.nextInt();
    
    if((a>0) && (c>0)){
      a -= d;
      c -= b;
    }
    
    if(c>0){
      System.out.println("No");
    }
    else{
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }
  }
}
    
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 9 10 10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 10, 9, 10 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the values of variables a and c are greater than 0.
Inside the if statement, it subtracts the value of variable d from variable a and it subtracts the value of variable b from variable c.
After the if statement, it checks if the value of variable c is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "No" as output. Otherwise, it prints "Yes" as output.
