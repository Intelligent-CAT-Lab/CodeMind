he variable n is initialized with 8.
It enters a while loop and it checks if n is even or odd. If it is even, it divides n by 2. If it is odd, it multiplies n by 3 and adds 1.
It also checks if n is already in the array A. If it is, it breaks out of the loop. If it is not, it adds n to the array A and increments the value of variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 12.
