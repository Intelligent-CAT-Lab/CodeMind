he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 5, 7 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is equal to b. If it is, it prints the value of variable c.
It checks if b is equal to c. If it is, it prints the value of variable a.
It checks if c is equal to a. If it is, it prints the value of variable b.
After the if statements, it prints an empty line.
<<<Output>>>
5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = scan.nextInt();
		int b = scan.nextInt();
		int c = scan.nextInt();
		if (a==b) {
			System.out.println(c);
		}
		if (b == c) {
			System.out.println(a);
		}
		if (c==a) {
			System.out.println(b);
		}
		System.out.println("");
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 5 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
