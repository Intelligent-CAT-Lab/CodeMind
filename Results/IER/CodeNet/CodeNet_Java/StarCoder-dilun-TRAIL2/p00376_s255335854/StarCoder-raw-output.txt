he variable x1 is initialized with 20 and variable x2 is initialized with 30.
The absolute value of the difference between x1 and x2 is calculated and printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * Red Dragonfly
 */
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int x1 = sc.nextInt();
		int x2 = sc.nextInt();

		System.out.println(Math.max(x1, x2));
	}
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 30
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x1 is initialized with 20 and variable x2 is initialized with 30.
The maximum value of x1 and x2 is calculated and printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
30
