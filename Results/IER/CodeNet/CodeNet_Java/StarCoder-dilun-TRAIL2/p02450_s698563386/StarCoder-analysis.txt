variable n is initialized with 2.
The variable base is initialized with an array of size 2. The array is initialized with values from 1 to 2.
The function make is called with arguments 0, 0, base, 2.
The function make enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable mask is equal to (1 << 2) - 1. The value of variable mask is 3.
The function make enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1.
The function make calls itself recursively with arguments value, mask | (1 << i), base, size.
The function make enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1.
The function make calls itself recursively with arguments value, mask | (1 << i), base, size.
