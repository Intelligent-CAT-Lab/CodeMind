he variable n is initialized with 3.
The if statement checks if n is even or odd. Since n is even, the if statement prints n as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        if (n % 2 == 0)
            System.out.println(n);
        else
            System.out.println(n * 2);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
The if statement checks if n is even or odd. Since n is odd, the if statement prints n multiplied by 2 as output.
<<<Output>>>
10
