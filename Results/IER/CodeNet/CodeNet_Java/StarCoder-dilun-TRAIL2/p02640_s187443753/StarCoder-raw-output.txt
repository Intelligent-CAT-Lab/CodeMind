he variable x is initialized with 3 and variable y is initialized with 8.
The code checks if x*2 is less than or equal to y and x*4 is greater than or equal to y.
If both conditions are met, it checks if y is even.
If y is even, it prints "Yes" as output.
If y is odd, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int x = sc.nextInt();
    int y = sc.nextInt();
    
    if ( x*2 <= y && x*4 >= y ) {
      if ( y % 2 == 0 ) {
        System.out.println("Yes");
        return;
      }
    } 
    
    System.out.println("No");
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 7
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 3 and variable y is initialized with 7.
The code checks if x*2 is less than or equal to y and x*4 is greater than or equal to y.
If both conditions are met, it checks if y is even.
If y is even, it prints "Yes" as output.
If y is odd, it prints "No" as output.
