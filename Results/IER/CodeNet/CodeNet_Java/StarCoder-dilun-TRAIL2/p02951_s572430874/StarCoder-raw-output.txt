he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 6, 4 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable c is less than or equal to the value of variable a minus the value of variable b. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
If it is not, it prints the value of variable c minus the value of variable a minus the value of variable b as output.
<<<Output>>>
0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c =sc.nextInt();
        //System.out.println(max);
        if(c-(a-b)<0){
            System.out.println("0");
        }else{
        System.out.println(c-(a-b));
        }

    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 4 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
