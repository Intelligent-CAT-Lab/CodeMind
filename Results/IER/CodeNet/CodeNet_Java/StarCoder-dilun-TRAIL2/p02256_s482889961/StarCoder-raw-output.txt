he variable a and variable b are initialized with 54 and 20 respectively according to the input.
The function calcu is called with the values of a and b as parameters.
Inside the function, variable ans is initialized with the value of a.
Then it enters a while loop and it checks if the value of b is not equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the remainder of a divided by b and assigns it to variable ans.
Then it reassigns the value of a to the value of b and reassigns the value of b to the value of ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable a as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
