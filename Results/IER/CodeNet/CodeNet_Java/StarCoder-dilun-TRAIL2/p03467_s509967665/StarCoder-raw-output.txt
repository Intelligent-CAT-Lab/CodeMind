 variable s is initialized with 011.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the length of variable s is 0. If it is, it returns 1.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable woFirst by calling the function doit with the substring of variable s starting from index 1.
Then it calculates the value of variable res by assigning the value of variable woFirst to it.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to half of the length of variable s. The value of variable len is also passed to variable cand.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the value of variable len. The value of variable rep is also passed to variable i.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the value of variable len. The value of variable i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the third for loop, it checks if the character at index i of variable s is equal to '1'. If it is, it assigns '1' to the character at index i of variable cand.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the value of variable rep. The value of variable rep is also passed to variable i.
Inside the fourth for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the value of variable len. The value of variable i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the fifth for loop, it checks if the character at index len * rep + i of variable s is equal to '0'. If it is, it assigns '0' to the character at index i of variable cand.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the value of variable rep. The value of variable rep is also passed to variable i.
Inside the sixth for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the value of variable len. The value of variable i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the seventh for loop, it calculates the value of variable cur by calling the function doit with the string created from variable cand as input.
Then it multiplies the value of variable cur with the value of variable woFirst by calling the function doit with the substring of variable s starting from index len * (rep +
