he variable k is initialized with 6.
The function init(k) is called to initialize the variables parent, rank and num.
The for loop iterates from 1 to k-1 to call the function unite(i, (i*10)%k) for each integer i.
The for loop iterates from 0 to k-1 to initialize the array edges.
The for loop iterates from 0 to k-1 to call the function same(i, (i+1)%k) for each integer i.
The for loop iterates from 0 to k-1 to add the root of the current integer i to the set of edges of the root of the next integer i+1.
The ArrayDeque dq is initialized.
The array d is initialized with -1.
The while loop iterates while the size of dq is greater than 0.
The first element of dq is extracted and stored in variable now.
The for loop iterates from 0 to the size of the set of edges of the current integer now.
The next element of the set of edges of the current integer now is extracted and stored in variable next.
If the value of d[next] is less than 0, it means that the value of d[next] has not been calculated yet.
The value of d[next] is set to d[now]+1 and the next element is added to the end of dq.
The for loop iterates from 0 to k-1 to set the value of d[i] to -1.
The value of d[root(1)] is set to 0.
The while loop iterates while the size of dq is greater than 0.
The first element of dq is extracted and stored in variable now.
The for loop iterates from 0 to the size of the set of edges of the current integer now.
The next element of the set of edges of the current integer now is extracted and stored in variable next.
If the value of d[next] is less than 0, it means that the value of d[next] has not been calculated yet.
The value of d[next] is set to d[now]+1 and the next element is added to the end of dq.
The value of d[root(0)]+1 is printed as output.
