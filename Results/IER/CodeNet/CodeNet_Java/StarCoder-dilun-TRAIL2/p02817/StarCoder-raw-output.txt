he variable string is initialized with "oder atc" and variable tString is initialized with " ".
The code concatenates the two variables and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = in.nextInt();
		int a = in.nextInt();
		int b = in.nextInt();
		int c = in.nextInt();
		int d = in.nextInt();
		int e = in.nextInt();
		int f = in.nextInt();
		int g = in.nextInt();
		int h = in.nextInt();
		int i = in.nextInt();
		int j = in.nextInt();
		int k = in.nextInt();
		int l = in.nextInt();
		int m = in.nextInt();
		int answer = 0;
		for (int x = 0; x < n; x++) {
			int sum = a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m;
			if (sum >= 1000000000) {
				answer++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(answer);
		in.close();
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10, and the rest of the variables are initialized with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9
