NO-ANSWER
riable N is initialized with 9.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 19 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it initializes a map with primary numbers as keys and 0 as values.
Then it enters a while loop and it iterates while n is less than or equal to N.
Inside the while loop, it increments the value of the key n in the map by N / n + map.get(primaryNumbers[i]).
The value of the key n in the map is also incremented by 1.
After the while loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 19 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it initializes a map with primary numbers as keys and 0 as values.
Then it enters a while loop and it iterates while n is less than or equal to N.
Inside the while loop, it increments the value of the key n in the map by N / n + map.get(primaryNumbers[j]).
The value of the key n in the map is also incremented by 1.
After the while loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 19 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable n.
