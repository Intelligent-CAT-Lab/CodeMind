he variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 0, 75, 25 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the following conditions are met:
1. variable a is less than or equal to i
2. variable i is less than or equal to variable b
3. variable c is less than or equal to i
4. variable i is less than or equal to variable d
If all the conditions are met, it sets the value of variable minSec to the minimum of i and variable minSec.
If none of the conditions are met, it sets the value of variable minSec to the maximum value of integer.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable minSec is the maximum value of integer. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
If it is not, it prints the difference between variable maxSec and variable minSec as output.
