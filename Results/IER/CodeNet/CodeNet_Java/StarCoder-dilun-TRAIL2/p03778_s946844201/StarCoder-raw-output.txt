he variable W is initialized with 3, variable a is initialized with 2 and variable b is initialized with 6.
The if statement checks if the sum of variable a and variable W is less than variable b. If it is, it prints the difference between variable b and the sum of variable a and variable W.
If the sum of variable a and variable W is greater than variable b, it prints the difference between variable a and the sum of variable b and variable W.
If the sum of variable a and variable W is equal to variable b, it prints 0.
