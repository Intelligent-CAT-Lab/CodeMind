variable n is initialized with 5 and variable k is initialized with 10.
It checks if n is less than or equal to k. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If it is not, it prints 0 as output.

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[i] + arr[j] == k) {

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 10
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 and variable k is initialized with 10.
Then it initializes an array arr of size 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the sum of arr[i] and arr[j] is equal to k. If it is, it increments the value of variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 1.
