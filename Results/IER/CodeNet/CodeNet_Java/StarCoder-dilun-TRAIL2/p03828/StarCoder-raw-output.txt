 variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it calls the method primeFactorize(i) to get the prime factorization of i.
The method primeFactorize(i) returns a list of maps, where each map represents a prime factorization of i.
The for loop iterates through the list of maps and for each map, it iterates through the map and for each entry, it adds the value of the entry to the corresponding index of the array ex.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans by multiplying the value of variable ans with the value of the corresponding index of the array ex plus 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        final int n = sc.nextInt();

        final int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        final int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1];
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[i]) {
                    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(dp[n - 1]);
    }
}

</Code>
