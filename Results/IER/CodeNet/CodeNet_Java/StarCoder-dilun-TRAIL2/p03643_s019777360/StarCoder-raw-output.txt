TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int num = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(num+1);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized with 100 according to the input.
It prints the value of variable num plus 1.
<<<Output>>>
101
