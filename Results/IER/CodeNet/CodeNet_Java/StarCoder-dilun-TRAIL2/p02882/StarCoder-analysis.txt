he variable A is initialized with 2, variable B is initialized with 2 and variable X is initialized with 4.
The value of variable d is calculated by using the following formula:
d = atan(z/A) * 180 / PI
where z is the following:
z = (A * A * B - X) / A / A * 2
If the value of z is greater than or equal to 0, then the value of variable d is calculated by using the following formula:
d = atan(z/A) * 180 / PI
If the value of z is less than 0, then the value of variable d is calculated by using the following formula:
d = atan(B / z) * 180 / PI
