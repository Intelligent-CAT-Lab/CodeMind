he variable A is initialized with 2, variable B is initialized with 2 and variable X is initialized with 4.
The value of variable d is calculated by using the following formula:
d = atan(z/A) * 180 / PI
where z is the following:
z = (A * A * B - X) / A / A * 2
If the value of z is greater than or equal to 0, then the value of variable d is calculated by using the following formula:
d = atan(z/A) * 180 / PI
If the value of z is less than 0, then the value of variable d is calculated by using the following formula:
d = atan(B / z) * 180 / PI
<<<Output>>>
180.0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
            int n = sc.nextInt();
            int a = sc.nextInt();
            int b = sc.nextInt();
            int c = sc.nextInt();

            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                int x = sc.nextInt();
                if (x >= a && x <= b) {
                    count++;
                }
            }

            if (count >= c) {
                System.out.println("YES");
            } else {
                System.out.println("NO");
            }
        }
    }

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 10 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5, variable a is initialized with 1, variable b is initialized with 10 and variable c is initialized with 3.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
