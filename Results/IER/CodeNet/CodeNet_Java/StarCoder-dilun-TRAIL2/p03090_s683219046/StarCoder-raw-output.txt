e variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to i to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable k.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the sum of i and j is equal to (n & ~1) - 1. If it does, it skips the current iteration of the second for loop and goes to the next iteration of the first for loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

1 2
1 3
