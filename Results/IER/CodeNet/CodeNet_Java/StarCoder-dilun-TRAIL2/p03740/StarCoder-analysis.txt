e variable sc is initialized with a new Scanner object.
The nextLong() method of the Scanner object is called twice to read two integers from the input.
The absolute value of the difference between the two integers is calculated and compared with 1.
If the absolute value is less than or equal to 1, the string "Brown" is printed as output. Otherwise, the string "Alice" is printed as output.
