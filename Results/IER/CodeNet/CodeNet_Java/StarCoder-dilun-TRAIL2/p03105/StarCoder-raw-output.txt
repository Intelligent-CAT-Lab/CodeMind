he variable A is initialized with 2, variable B is initialized with 11 and variable C is initialized with 4.
The variable N is initialized with the value of B divided by A.
The if statement checks if the value of N is greater than the value of C. If it is, it prints the value of C. Otherwise, it prints the value of N.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner entrada= new Scanner(System.in);
        int A= entrada.nextInt();
        int B= entrada.nextInt();
        int C= entrada.nextInt();
        int N=(int)B/A;
        if (N>C){
            System.out.println(C);
        }
        else{
            System.out.println(N);
        }
    }
    
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 11 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
