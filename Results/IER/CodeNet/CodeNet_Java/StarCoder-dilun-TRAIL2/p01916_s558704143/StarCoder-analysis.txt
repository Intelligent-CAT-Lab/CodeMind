he variable s is initialized with the input string.
It creates an array of 26 integers with all elements initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it increments the element of the array a at the index of the character c.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the elements of the array a at the index of the character c.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the average of the elements of the array a at the index of the character c.
It prints the final value of variable sum/2 as output, which is 1.
