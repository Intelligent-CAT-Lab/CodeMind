he variable s is initialized with the input string.
It creates an array of 26 integers with all elements initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it increments the element of the array a at the index of the character c.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the elements of the array a at the index of the character c.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the average of the elements of the array a at the index of the character c.
It prints the final value of variable sum/2 as output, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s=sc.next();
        int[] a= new int[26];
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
        	a[s.charAt(i)-'a']++;
        }
        for(int i=0; i<26; i++) {
        	sum+=a[i]%2;
        }//各文字2ずつ入ってれば良いから1つしかない文字をカウント
        System.out.println(sum/2);//cpcみたいなの以外は各文字2つになるようにする。
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```cpc
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
