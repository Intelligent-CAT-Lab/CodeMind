he variable N is initialized with 8.
The variable n2 is initialized with 4.
The variable n3 is initialized with 2.
The variable amari is initialized with 2.
The if statement checks if the value of variable amari is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the value of variable n3, which is 2.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int n2 = N / 2;
		int n3 = N / 3;
		int amari = N % 3;
		if (amari == 0) {
			System.out.println(N / 3);
		} else if (amari == 1) {
			System.out.println(N / 3);
		} else if (amari == 2) {
			System.out.println(N / 3);
		}
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
