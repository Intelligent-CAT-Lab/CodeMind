he variable K is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it concatenates the string "ACL" to variable answer.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is "ACLACLACL".
<<<Output>>>
ACLACLACL

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        Main m = new Main(sc);
        m.show(m.solve());
        sc.close();
    }
    
	//フィールド
    Scanner sc;
    int K;
    
    //入力
    Main(Scanner sc) {
        this.sc = sc;
        this.K = sc.nextInt();
    }
    
    //解答処理
    private String solve() {
        String answer = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < K; i++) {
        	answer += "ACL";
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
    
    //出力
    public void show(String answer) {
        System.out.println(answer);
    }

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
