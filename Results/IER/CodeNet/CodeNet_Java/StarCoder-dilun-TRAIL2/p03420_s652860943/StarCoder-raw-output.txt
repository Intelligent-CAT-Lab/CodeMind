he variable N is initialized with 5 and variable K is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer alpha in this range. The value of variable alpha is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable n by dividing (N-K) by b.
Then it adds the product of n and alpha to variable ans.
Then it checks if K+n*b is less than or equal to N. If it is, it adds the minimum of N, K+n*b+alpha-1 and K+n*b+alpha-1 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scan.nextInt();
        int K = scan.nextInt();
        long ans = 0;
        for(int alpha = 1; K+alpha<=N;++alpha){
            int b = K+alpha;
            int n = (N-K)/b;
            ans += n*alpha;
            if(K+n*b<=N)ans += Math.min(N, K+n*b+alpha-1) - (K+n*b)+1;
        }
        if(K==0)ans -=N;
        System.out.println(ans);
    }   
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10 and variable K is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer alpha in this range. The value of variable alpha is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable n by dividing (N-K) by b.
