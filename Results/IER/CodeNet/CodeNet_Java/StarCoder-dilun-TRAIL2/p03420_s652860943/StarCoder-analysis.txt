he variable N is initialized with 5 and variable K is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer alpha in this range. The value of variable alpha is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable n by dividing (N-K) by b.
Then it adds the product of n and alpha to variable ans.
Then it checks if K+n*b is less than or equal to N. If it is, it adds the minimum of N, K+n*b+alpha-1 and K+n*b+alpha-1 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
