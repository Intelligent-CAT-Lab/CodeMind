he variable n is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 15 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable factorial.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable factorial by taking the power of 2 to the power of i.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable cha.
Inside the for loop, it converts the integer i to a binary string and stores it in variable str.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to str.length() - 1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable cha.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the jth character of the binary string str is '1'. If it is, it prints the value of j.
After the loop finishes, it prints the current value of variable i and the values of j that are 1.
