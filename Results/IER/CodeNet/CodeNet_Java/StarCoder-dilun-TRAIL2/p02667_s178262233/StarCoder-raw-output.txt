variable vals is initialized with the input.
The variable tot is initialized with 0.
The variable ones is initialized with 0.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable vals. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans by adding i/2+1 to it.
Then it checks if the character at position i of variable vals is '0'. If it is, it sets the value of variable par at position tot to the value of variable ones modulo 2.
If it is not, it increments the value of variable ones by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the value of variable tot. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable minus at position i by adding i/2+1 to it.
Then it calculates the value of variable minus at position i by adding the value of variable nextPar at position i+1 to it.
Then it calculates the value of variable minus at position i by adding the value of variable nextPar at position tot-i-1 to it.
Then it calculates the value of variable minus at position i by subtracting the value of variable nextPar at position i+1 from it.
Then it calculates the value of variable minus at position i by subtracting the value of variable nextPar at position tot-i-1 from it.
Then it calculates the value of variable minus at position i by subtracting the value of variable nextPar at position i+1 from it.
Then it calculates the value of variable minus at position i by subtracting the value of variable nextPar at position tot-i-1 from it.
Then it calculates the value of variable minus at position i by subtracting the value of variable nextPar at position i+1 from it.
Then it calculates the value of variable minus at position i by subtracting the value of variable nextPar at position tot-i-1 from it.
Then it calculates the value of variable minus at position i by subtracting the value of variable nextPar at position i+1 from it.
Then it calculates the value of variable minus at position i by subtracting the value of variable nextPar at position tot-i-
