he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2.
The code subtracts k from n and prints the result.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		// 整数の入力
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k= sc.nextInt();
		
		System.out.println(n-k+1);

	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
