he variable X is initialized with 20.
The variable dp is initialized with an empty list.
The variable i is initialized with 2.
The do-while loop is entered and it checks if i is less than X.
Inside the do-while loop, it checks if i is divisible by any number in the list dp. If it is not, it adds i to the list dp.
The loop iterates and i is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from X to 2X.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is divisible by any number in the list dp. If it is not, it adds i to the list dp.
The loop iterates and i is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
