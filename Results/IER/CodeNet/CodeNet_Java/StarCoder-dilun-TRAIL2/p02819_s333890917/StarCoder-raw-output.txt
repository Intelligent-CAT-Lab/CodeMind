he variable X is initialized with 20.
The variable dp is initialized with an empty list.
The variable i is initialized with 2.
The do-while loop is entered and it checks if i is less than X.
Inside the do-while loop, it checks if i is divisible by any number in the list dp. If it is not, it adds i to the list dp.
The loop iterates and i is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from X to 2X.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is divisible by any number in the list dp. If it is not, it adds i to the list dp.
The loop iterates and i is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {

	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int X = sc.nextInt();
		int ans = 0;
		for(int i=1;i<X;i++) {
			if(X%i==0) ans+=i;
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 20.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The for loop is entered and it iterates from 1 to X-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if X is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i to variable ans.
The loop iterates and i is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
