he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 1.
The code checks if the product of n and k is odd or even. If it is odd, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		if(n % 2 == 1 && k % 2 == 1) {
			System.out.println("Yes");
		}
		else System.out.println("No");
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 1.
The code checks if both n and k are odd or even. If they are both odd, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No
