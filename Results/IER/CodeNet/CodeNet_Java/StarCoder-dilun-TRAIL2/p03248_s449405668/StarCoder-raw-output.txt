he variable s is initialized with the input string "1111".
The variable N is initialized with the length of the string s.
The variable c is initialized with the character array of the string s.
The if statement checks if the first character of the string s is '0' or the second last character of the string s is '0' or the last character of the string s is '1'. If any of these conditions is met, the code prints -1 and returns.
The variable NN is initialized with the value of N-1.
The for loop iterates from 0 to NN/2-1. The value of i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of the string s is not equal to the character at index NN-1-i of the string s. If it is not, the code prints -1 and returns.
The variable parent is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to N-1-1. The value of i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it prints the value of parent+1 and i+2.
If the character at index i of the string s is '1', the value of variable parent is updated to i+1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        int N = s.length();
        char[] c = s.toCharArray();
        int[] dp = new int[N+1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i=1;i<=N;i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i-1];
            if (c[i-1]=='1') {
                dp[i] += dp[i-2];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(dp[N]);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1111
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input
