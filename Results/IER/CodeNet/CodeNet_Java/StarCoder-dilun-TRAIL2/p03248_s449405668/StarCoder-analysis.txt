he variable s is initialized with the input string "1111".
The variable N is initialized with the length of the string s.
The variable c is initialized with the character array of the string s.
The if statement checks if the first character of the string s is '0' or the second last character of the string s is '0' or the last character of the string s is '1'. If any of these conditions is met, the code prints -1 and returns.
The variable NN is initialized with the value of N-1.
The for loop iterates from 0 to NN/2-1. The value of i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of the string s is not equal to the character at index NN-1-i of the string s. If it is not, the code prints -1 and returns.
The variable parent is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to N-1-1. The value of i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it prints the value of parent+1 and i+2.
If the character at index i of the string s is '1', the value of variable parent is updated to i+1.
