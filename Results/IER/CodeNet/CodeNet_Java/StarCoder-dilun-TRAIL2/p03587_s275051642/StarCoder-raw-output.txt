he variable s is initialized with the string "111100" according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of the string s is equal to '1'. If it is, it adds 1 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                ans++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the integer 12 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the value of variable n. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable n is divisible by i. If it is, it adds 1 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
