he variable n is initialized with 3.
Then it checks if n is even or odd. If it is even, it calculates the value of a and b by dividing n by 2. If it is odd, it calculates the value of a and b by dividing n by 2 and adding 1 to the result.
After the calculation, it prints the product of a and b as output, which is 9.
