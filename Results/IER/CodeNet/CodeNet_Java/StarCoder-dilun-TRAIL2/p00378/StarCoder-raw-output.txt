e variable A, B and variable X are initialized with 180, 100 and 2400 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if the remainder of X divided by 500 is not 0. If it is not 0, it adds 500 minus the remainder of X divided by 500 to X.
The if statement checks if A is less than B. If it is, it calculates the value of variable a by dividing X by 1000 and adding 1 if the remainder of X divided by 1000 is greater than 0.
The if statement checks if A is greater than 2*B. If it is, it calculates the value of variable b by dividing X by 500.
The if statement checks if A is equal to 2*B. If it is, it calculates the value of variable a by dividing X by 1000 and calculates the value of variable b by dividing the remainder of X divided by 1000 by 500.
After the if statements finish, it prints the final value of variable A multiplied by variable a plus the value of variable B multiplied by variable b as output, which is 10000.
<<<Output>>>
10000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main{
    void solve(){
        int N, X, ans;
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        N = sc.nextInt();
        X = sc.nextInt();

        if ( X % 500!= 0 ) X += 500 - X%500;
        int a = 0;
        int b = 0;

        if ( N < 1000 ) {
            a = X/1000 + ((X%1000>0)?1:0);
        } else if ( N > 2000 ){
            b = X/500;
        } else {
            a = X/1000; X %= 1000;
            b = X/500;
        }

        System.out.println(N*a + b);
    }
