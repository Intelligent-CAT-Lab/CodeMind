e variable A, B and variable X are initialized with 180, 100 and 2400 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if the remainder of X divided by 500 is not 0. If it is not 0, it adds 500 minus the remainder of X divided by 500 to X.
The if statement checks if A is less than B. If it is, it calculates the value of variable a by dividing X by 1000 and adding 1 if the remainder of X divided by 1000 is greater than 0.
The if statement checks if A is greater than 2*B. If it is, it calculates the value of variable b by dividing X by 500.
The if statement checks if A is equal to 2*B. If it is, it calculates the value of variable a by dividing X by 1000 and calculates the value of variable b by dividing the remainder of X divided by 1000 by 500.
After the if statements finish, it prints the final value of variable A multiplied by variable a plus the value of variable B multiplied by variable b as output, which is 10000.
