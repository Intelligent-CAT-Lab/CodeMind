e variable s is initialized with the input.
It creates a HashSet object and initializes it with an empty set.
It enters a for loop and it iterates over the characters of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character c is already in the set. If it is, it continues to the next character.
If the character c is not in the set, it prints the string s plus the character c as output.
If the for loop finishes without printing anything, it enters another for loop and it iterates from the last character of the string s to the first character.
Inside the for loop, it creates a substring of the string s starting from the current character i and ending at the last character of the string s.
Then it creates another substring of the string s starting from the first character of the string s and ending at the current character i - 1.
It enters another for loop and it iterates over the characters of the substring cutted.
Inside the for loop, it removes the character c from the set.
It enters another for loop and it iterates over the characters of the string s starting from the character c of the substring cutted and ending at the character 'z'.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character c is already in the set. If it is, it continues to the next character.
If the character c is not in the set, it prints the substring base plus the character c as output.
If the for loop finishes without printing anything, it enters another for loop and it iterates over the characters of the substring cutted.
Inside the for loop, it adds the character c to the set.
If the for loop finishes without printing anything, it prints -1 as output.
