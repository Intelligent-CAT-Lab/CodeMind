he variable n is initialized with 4 and variable m is initialized with 3.
The variable dp is initialized with 100010 rows and 2 columns. The first column is for the case when the current integer i is not in the range [m, n]. The second column is for the case when the current integer i is in the range [m, n].
The first row is initialized with 1.
The for loop iterates from 1 to n. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[k][0] by adding the value of dp[k-1][0] and dp[k-1][1]. The value of dp[k][1] is also calculated in the same way.
Then it checks if the current integer k is in the range [m, n]. If it is, it subtracts the value of dp[k-m][0] from dp[k][1].
After the loop finishes, it calculates the final value of dp[n][0] and dp[n][1] by adding the values of dp[n][0] and dp[n][1].
Finally, it calculates the final value of the output by subtracting the value of dp[n][0] and dp[n][1] from the value of 2^n.
