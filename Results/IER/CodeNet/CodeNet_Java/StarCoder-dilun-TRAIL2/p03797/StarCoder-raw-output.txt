he variable N and variable M are initialized with 1 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the product of N and 2 is greater than M. If it is, it calculates the sum of M divided by 2.
If the product of N and 2 is less than M, it calculates the sum of N and the difference of M and the product of N and 2 divided by 4.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int N=sc.nextInt();
		int M=sc.nextInt();
		int sum=0;
		for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){
			sum=sum+i;
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable M are initialized with 1 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to N to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
