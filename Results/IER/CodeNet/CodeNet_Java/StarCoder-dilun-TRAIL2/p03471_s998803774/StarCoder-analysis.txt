he variable n is initialized with 9 and variable y is initialized with 45000.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2000 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to the value of variable y. If it does, it prints the values of variables i, j and n-i-j as output.
If the condition is not met, it continues to the next iteration of the second for loop.
If the condition is not met, it continues to the next iteration of the first for loop.
If the condition is not met, it prints -1 -1 -1 as output.
