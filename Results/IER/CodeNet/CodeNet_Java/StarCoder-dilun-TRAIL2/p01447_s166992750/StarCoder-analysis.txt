he variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input.
It enters a if statement to check if n is in the range [1, 3]. If it is, it returns 1.
If n is not in the range [1, 3], it enters a else if statement to check if n is divisible by 3. If it is, it returns the result of the recursive call loop(n/3) + 1.
If n is not divisible by 3, it enters a else statement to return the maximum of the recursive call loop(n/3 + 1) + 1 and loop(n/3) + 1.
After the if statement finishes, it returns the result of the recursive call loop(n/3 + 1) + 1 and loop(n/3) + 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of the recursive call loop(n/3 + 1) + 1 and loop(n/3) + 1 as output, which is 3.
