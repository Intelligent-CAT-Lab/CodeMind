he variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input.
It enters a if statement to check if n is in the range [1, 3]. If it is, it returns 1.
If n is not in the range [1, 3], it enters a else if statement to check if n is divisible by 3. If it is, it returns the result of the recursive call loop(n/3) + 1.
If n is not divisible by 3, it enters a else statement to return the maximum of the recursive call loop(n/3 + 1) + 1 and loop(n/3) + 1.
After the if statement finishes, it returns the result of the recursive call loop(n/3 + 1) + 1 and loop(n/3) + 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of the recursive call loop(n/3 + 1) + 1 and loop(n/3) + 1 as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int r = loop(n);
		System.out.println(r);
		sc.close();
	}

	static int loop(int n) {
		if (n > 0 && n < 4)
			return 1;
		else if (n % 3 == 0)
			return loop(n / 3) + 1;
		else
			return Math.max(loop(n / 3 + 1) + 1, loop(n / 3) + 1);
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a if statement
