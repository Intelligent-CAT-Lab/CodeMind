e variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The condition (b - a) % 2 == 1 is checked. Since it is true, the code calculates the minimum of the following two values:
ans1 = a - 1 + (b - a + 1) / 2
ans2 = n - a + 1 - 1 + (n - b + 1) / 2
The value of ans1 is 2, and the value of ans2 is 3.
The minimum of these two values is 2.
