he variable s is initialized with the input string "SAT".
The variable a is initialized with 1.
It checks if the string s is equal to "SUN". If it is, it sets the value of variable a to 7.
It checks if the string s is equal to "MON". If it is, it sets the value of variable a to 6.
It checks if the string s is equal to "TUE". If it is, it sets the value of variable a to 5.
It checks if the string s is equal to "WED". If it is, it sets the value of variable a to 4.
It checks if the string s is equal to "THU". If it is, it sets the value of variable a to 3.
It checks if the string s is equal to "FRI". If it is, it sets the value of variable a to 2.
It checks if the string s is equal to any of the above. If it is not, it does nothing.
After the if-else statements, it prints the value of variable a as output, which is 1.
