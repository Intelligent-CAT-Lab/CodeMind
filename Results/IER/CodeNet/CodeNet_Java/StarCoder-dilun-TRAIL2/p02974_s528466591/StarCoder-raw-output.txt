e variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable seenNum.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable unpairNum.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer p in this range. The value of variable p is also passed to variable oddness.
Inside the third for loop, it calculates the value of variable wayNums[i][j][p] by adding the values of the following expressions:
```
addMod(addMod(multiplyMod(2 * j + 1, getWayNum(wayNums, i - 1, j, p - 2 * j)), multiplyMod((j + 1) * (j + 1), getWayNum(wayNums, i - 1, j + 1, p - 2 * j))), getWayNum(wayNums, i - 1, j - 1, p - 2 * j))
```
```
addMod(addMod(multiplyMod(2 * j + 1, getWayNum(wayNums, i - 1, j, p - 2 * j)), multiplyMod((j + 1) * (j + 1), getWayNum(wayNums, i - 1, j + 1, p - 2 * j))), getWayNum(wayNums, i - 1, j - 1, p - 2 * j))
```
```
addMod(addMod(multiplyMod(2 * j + 1, getWayNum(wayNums, i - 1, j, p - 2 * j)), multiplyMod((j + 1) * (j + 1), getWayNum(wayNums, i - 1, j + 1, p - 2 * j))), getWayNum(wayNums, i - 1, j - 1, p - 2 * j))
```
The first expression is calculated by multiplying 2 * j + 1 with the value
