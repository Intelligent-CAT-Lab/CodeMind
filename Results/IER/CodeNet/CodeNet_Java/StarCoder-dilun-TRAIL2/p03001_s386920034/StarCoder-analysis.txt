variable w, variable h, variable x and variable y are initialized with 2, 3, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The code calculates the area of the rectangle with the width of variable w and the height of variable h.
Then it checks if the area is equal to 2 times the variable x and 2 times the variable y. If it is, it prints 1 as output. Otherwise, it prints 0 as output.
