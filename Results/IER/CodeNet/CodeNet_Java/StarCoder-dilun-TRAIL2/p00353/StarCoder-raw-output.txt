he variable m, variable f and variable b are initialized with 1000, 3000 and 3000 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable b is greater than the sum of variable m and variable f. If it is, it prints "NA".
If it is not, it checks if the value of variable b is greater than variable m. If it is, it prints the difference of variable b and variable m.
If it is not, it prints "0".
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      
      String[] input = sc.nextLine().split(" ");
      int n = Integer.parseInt(input[0]);
      int k = Integer.parseInt(input[1]);
      
      int[] arr = new int[n];
      
      for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
         arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
      }
      
      int count = 0;
      
      for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
         if(arr[i] % k == 0) {
            count++;
         }
      }
      
      System.out.println(count);
   }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by variable k. If it is, it increments the value of variable count.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which
