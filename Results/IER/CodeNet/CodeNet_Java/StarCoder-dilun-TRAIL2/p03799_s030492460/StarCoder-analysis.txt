he variable S is initialized with 1 and variable c is initialized with 6.
The condition S>=c/2 is true, so the value of variable ans is initialized with c/2.
The condition S>=c/2 is false, so the value of variable ans is initialized with S + (c/2-S)/2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
