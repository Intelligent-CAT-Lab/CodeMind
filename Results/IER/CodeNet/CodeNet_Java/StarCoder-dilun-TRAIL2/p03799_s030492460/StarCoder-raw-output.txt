he variable S is initialized with 1 and variable c is initialized with 6.
The condition S>=c/2 is true, so the value of variable ans is initialized with c/2.
The condition S>=c/2 is false, so the value of variable ans is initialized with S + (c/2-S)/2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int M = sc.nextInt();
		int ans = 0;
		for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){
			for(int j=1;j<=M;j++){
				if(i%2==0 && j%2==0){
					ans++;
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 and variable M is initialized with 5.
The for loop iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, the for loop iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current interger i is even and the current interger j is even. If it is, it adds 1 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
