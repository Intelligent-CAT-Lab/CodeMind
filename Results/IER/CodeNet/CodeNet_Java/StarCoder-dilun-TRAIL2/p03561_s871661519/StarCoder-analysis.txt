he variable k is initialized with 3 and variable n is initialized with 2.
The value of variable k is divided by 2 and the result is stored in variable k.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it adds the value of variable k to the list res.
Then it checks if the size of list res is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it removes the last element of list res.
After the loop finishes, it prints the list res as output.
