he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable m is initialized with 14.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from m/n to 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if m is divisible by i. If it is, it prints the value of i and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of i as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;public class Main{public static void main(String[]a){Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);int n=s.nextInt();int m=s.nextInt();for(int i=m/n;true;i--)if(m%i==0){System.out.print(i);break;}}}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 15
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
