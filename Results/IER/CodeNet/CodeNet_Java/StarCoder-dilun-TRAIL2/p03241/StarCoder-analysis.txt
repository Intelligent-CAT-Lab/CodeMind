he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable m is initialized with 14.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from m/n to 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if m is divisible by i. If it is, it prints the value of i and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of i as output, which is 4.
