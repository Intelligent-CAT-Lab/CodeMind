he variable sc is initialized with a Scanner object.
The user is prompted to enter an integer.
The integer is passed to the Scanner object sc as input.
The integer is then passed to the method nextInt() of the Scanner object sc.
The value returned by the method nextInt() is then passed to the method split() of the String object "thu:fri:sat:sun:mon:tue:wed".
The value returned by the method split() is then passed to the method print() of the System class.
The value returned by the method print() is then printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("thu:fri:sat:sun:mon:tue:wed".split(":")[sc.nextInt()%7]);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
