e variable n is initialized with -9.
It enters a while loop and it checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 and returns.
Otherwise, it enters another while loop and it checks if n is divisible by -2. If it is, it appends 0 to the string builder sb.
Otherwise, it appends 1 to the string builder sb.
Then it checks if n is less than 0. If it is, it divides n by -2 and adds 1 to it.
Otherwise, it divides n by -2.
After the loop finishes, it reverses the string builder sb and prints it as output.
