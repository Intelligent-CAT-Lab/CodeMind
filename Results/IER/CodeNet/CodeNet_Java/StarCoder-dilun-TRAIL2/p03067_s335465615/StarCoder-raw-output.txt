he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 3, 8 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is less than or equal to b. If it is, it checks if a is less than or equal to c and c is less than or equal to b. If it is, it sets variable ans to true.
If a is greater than b, it checks if a is greater than or equal to c and c is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it sets variable ans to true.
After the if-else block, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is true.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        boolean ans = false;
        if(a <= b) {
            if(a <= c && c <= b) ans = true;
        } else {
            if(a >= c && c >= b) ans = true;
        }
        System.out.println((ans?"Yes":"No"));
        
    } 
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
