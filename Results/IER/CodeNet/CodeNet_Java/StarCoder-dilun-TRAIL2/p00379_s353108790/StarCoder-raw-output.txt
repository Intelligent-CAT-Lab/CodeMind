he variable a is initialized with 16, variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is initialized with 1000.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1000 to check each integer x in this range. The value of variable x is also passed to variable y.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger y by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable y.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger y_plus_a by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable y_plus_a.
Then it calculates the product of the current interger xx by repeatedlly multiplying the current interger y_plus_a with itself n times.
Then it checks if the calculated variable xx equals the current interger x. If it does, it adds 1 to variable an. The condition is met when x is 16, 17, 18, 19, 26, 27, 28, 29, 36, 37, 38, 39, 46, 47, 48, 49, 56, 57, 58, 59, 66, 67, 68, 69, 76, 77, 78, 79, 86, 87, 88, 89, 96, 97, 98, 99, 106, 107, 108, 109, 116, 117, 118, 119, 126, 127, 128, 129, 136, 137, 138, 139, 146, 147, 148, 149, 156, 157, 158, 159, 166, 167, 168, 169, 176, 177
