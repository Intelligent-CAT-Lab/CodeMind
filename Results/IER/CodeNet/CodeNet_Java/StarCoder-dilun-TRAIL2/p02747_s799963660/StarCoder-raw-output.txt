variable N is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string N. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string N is 'h' or 'i' based on the value of variable i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable hi as output, which is true.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main {
	
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    	String N = sc.next();
    	int count = 0;
    	for (int i = 0; i < N.length(); i++) {
    		if (N.charAt(i) == 'h') {
    			count++;
    		}
    	}
    	System.out.println(count);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```hihi
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string N. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string N is 'h'. If it is, it increments the value of variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
