he variable n is initialized with 4.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 4 to 0 to check each integer n in this range. The value of variable n is also passed to variable list.
Inside the while loop, it converts the string input to double and stores it in the corresponding index of the array list.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the square root of the difference between the first and third elements of the array list and the difference between the second and fourth elements of the array list.
It prints the final value of the square root as output, which is 1.4142135623730951.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
       String[] lines=br.readLine().split(" ");
       int n=Integer.parseInt(lines[0]);
       int[] list=new int[n];
       int i=0;
       while(i<n){
           list[i]=Integer.parseInt(lines[i+1]);
           i++;
       }
       int max=list[0];
       for(int j=1;j<n;j++){
           if(list[j]>max){
               max=list[j];
           }
       }
       System.out.println(max);

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable list.
Inside the while loop, it converts the string input to integer and stores it in the corresponding index of the
