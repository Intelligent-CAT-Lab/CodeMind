he variable n is initialized with 4.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 4 to 0 to check each integer n in this range. The value of variable n is also passed to variable list.
Inside the while loop, it converts the string input to double and stores it in the corresponding index of the array list.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the square root of the difference between the first and third elements of the array list and the difference between the second and fourth elements of the array list.
It prints the final value of the square root as output, which is 1.4142135623730951.
