 variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if n is equal to 1 and m is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If the condition is not met, it checks if n is equal to 1 and m is not equal to 1. If it is, it prints m-2 as output.
If the condition is not met, it checks if m is equal to 1 and n is not equal to 1. If it is, it prints n-2 as output.
If the condition is not met, it prints (m-2)*(n-2) as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(System.in);

		int n = stdIn.nextInt();
		int m = stdIn.nextInt();

		if(n==1 && m==1) {
			System.out.println(1);
		}else if(n == 1 && m!= 1) {
			System.out.println(m-2);
		}else if(m == 1 && n!= 1){
			System.out.println(n-2);
		}else {
			System.out.println((long)(m-2)*(n-2));
		}



	}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if n is equal to 1 and m is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If the condition is not met, it checks if n is equal to 1 and m is not equal to 1. If it is, it prints m-2 as output.
If the condition is not met, it checks if
