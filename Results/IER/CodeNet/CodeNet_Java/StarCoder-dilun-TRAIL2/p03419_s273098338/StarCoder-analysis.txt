variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if n is equal to 1 and m is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If the condition is not met, it checks if n is equal to 1 and m is not equal to 1. If it is, it prints m-2 as output.
If the condition is not met, it checks if m is equal to 1 and n is not equal to 1. If it is, it prints n-2 as output.
If the condition is not met, it prints (m-2)*(n-2) as output.
