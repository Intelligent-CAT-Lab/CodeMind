he variable mstr is initialized with "AADINNUY" and variable nstr is initialized with "AIZUNYAN".
The variable t is initialized with "AAAAAAAA".
The variable tt is initialized with "".
The Scanner object scan is initialized with System.in.
The while loop is entered and it checks if there is another input.
The variable dstr is initialized with the next input.
If the length of variable dstr is less than 8, it prints the variable dstr and goes to the next iteration of the while loop.
Otherwise, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable dstr minus 7.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the variable t with the substring of variable dstr from index i to index i plus 8.
Then it initializes the variable tt with the value of variable t.
Then it sorts the variable t by calling the method sort.
Then it checks if the value of variable mstr is equal to the value of variable t.
If it is, it replaces the substring of variable dstr from index i to index i plus 8 with the value of variable nstr.
Then it increments i by 7.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable dstr as output.
