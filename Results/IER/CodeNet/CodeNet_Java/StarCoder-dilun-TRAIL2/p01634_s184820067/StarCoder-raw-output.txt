e variable input is initialized with the input string "password".
It checks if the length of the input is greater than or equal to 6.
It checks if the input contains at least one lowercase character.
It checks if the input contains at least one uppercase character.
It checks if the input contains at least one digit.
If all the conditions are met, it prints "VALID" as output.
<<<Output>>>
VALID

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		
		int max = arr[0];
		
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			if (arr[i] > max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
		}
		
		System.out.println(max);
	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer 5.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is greater than the current maximum value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the current interger i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
