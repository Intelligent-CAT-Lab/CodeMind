he variable s is initialized with the input string "ABCABC".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is equal to 'A'. If it is, it increments the value of variable acnt by 1.
Then it checks if the current character c is equal to 'B' and if the next character is equal to 'C'. If it is, it adds the value of variable acnt to variable sum.
Then it increments the value of variable i by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 2.
