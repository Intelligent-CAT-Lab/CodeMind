he variable s is initialized with the input string ATCODER.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string s is one of the four DNA bases A, C, G or T. If it is, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
If it is not, it adds the current value of variable cnt to the priority queue pq.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of the priority queue pq as output, which is 4.
