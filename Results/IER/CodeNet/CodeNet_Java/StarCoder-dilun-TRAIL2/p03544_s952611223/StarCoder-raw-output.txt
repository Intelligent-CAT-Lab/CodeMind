he variable a is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 5 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of the next integer in the sequence by adding the previous two integers.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable now as output, which is 13.
<<<Output>>>
13
