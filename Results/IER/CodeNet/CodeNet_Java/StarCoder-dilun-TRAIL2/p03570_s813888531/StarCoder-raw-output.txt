e variable S is initialized with the input string "aabxyyzz".
The variable N is initialized with the length of the input string S.
The variable dp is initialized with an array of size 2^26. The array is filled with the value of infinity.
The variable mask is initialized with 0.
The variable dp[0] is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable mask by XORing it with 1<<(S[i]-'a').
Then it sets the value of dp[mask] to the minimum of the current value of dp[mask] and i+1.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable mask by XORing it with 1<<(j).
Then it sets the value of dp[mask] to the minimum of the current value of dp[mask] and 1+dp[mask^1<<j].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of dp[mask] as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
