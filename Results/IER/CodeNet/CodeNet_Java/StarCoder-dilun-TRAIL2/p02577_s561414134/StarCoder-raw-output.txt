he variable n is initialized with 123456789.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 8 to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable digit.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current character digit by converting it to a number and adding it to variable total.
Then it checks if the calculated variable total is divisible by 9. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    String n = sc.next();
    char[] digit = n.toCharArray();

    int total = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i< digit.length; i++){
      total += Character.getNumericValue(digit[i]);
    }

    if(total % 9 == 0){
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }else{
      System.out.println("No");
    }

    return;

  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1234567890
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
