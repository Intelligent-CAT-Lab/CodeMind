he variable num is initialized with 615.
The variable stack_item is initialized with num/100.
The variable diff is initialized with num - stack_item * 100.
The variable pos is initialized with false.
The if statement checks if diff is less than or equal to stack_item * 5. If it is, then pos is set to true.
The if statement checks if pos is true. If it is, then it prints 1 as output.
The if statement checks if pos is false. If it is, then it prints 0 as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

  		int num = sc.nextInt(); 
      	int stack_item = num/100;
      	int diff = num - stack_item * 100;
      	boolean pos = false;
      
      	if(diff <= stack_item*5) pos = true;
      	
      	if(pos) System.out.println("1");
      	else System.out.println("0");
        
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```616
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
