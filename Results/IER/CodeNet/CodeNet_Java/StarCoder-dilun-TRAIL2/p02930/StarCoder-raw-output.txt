ariable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable left.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable right.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable center by dividing the sum of variable left and variable right by 2.
Inside the second for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from variable left to variable center to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the second for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from variable center to variable right to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable j.
Inside the third for loop, it assigns the value of variable level to the element of the 2D array ret at position [i][j].
Inside the third for loop, it assigns the value of variable level to the element of the 2D array ret at position [j][j].
