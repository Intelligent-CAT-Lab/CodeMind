he variable K is initialized with 101.
The if statement checks if K is even. Since K is odd, the if statement is not executed.
The for loop is executed 100000000 times. The variable cur is initialized with 7. The variable cnt is initialized with 1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the current value of cur by multiplying it by 10 and adding 7. Then it calculates the remainder of cur divided by K.
If the remainder is 0, it prints the value of cnt as output and returns.
If the remainder is not 0, it increments the value of cnt by 1 and repeats the process.
Since the remainder is not 0 after 100000000 iterations, it prints -1 as output.
