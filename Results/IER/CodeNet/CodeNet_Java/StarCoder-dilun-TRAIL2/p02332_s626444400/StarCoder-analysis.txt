e variable N is initialized with 2 and variable K is initialized with 3.
The code enters a if statement and checks if N is greater than K. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
If N is not greater than K, it enters a else statement and initializes variable ans with 1.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from K to K-N+1. The value of variable i is also passed to variable kei.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying ans with kei and then modding it with 1000000007.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 6.
