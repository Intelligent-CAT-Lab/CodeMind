he variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 0 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it assigns -1 to the index of variable b which is the same as the value of variable a.
After the loop finishes, it calls the method rec with the arguments b, 0 and n.
The method rec is called with the arguments b, 0 and n.
The method rec enters a if statement and it checks if the difference between right and left is 2.
If it is, it enters another if statement and it checks if the value of b at index left is -1 and the value of b at index left + 1 is -1.
If it is, it returns -1.
If it is not, it enters another if statement and it checks if the value of b at index left is -1 or the value of b at index left + 1 is -1.
If it is, it returns 0.
If it is not, it returns 1.
After the if statement finishes, it enters another if statement and it checks if the value of leftSum is -1 and the value of rightSum is -1.
If it is, it returns -1.
If it is not, it enters another if statement and it checks if the value of leftSum is -1 or the value of rightSum is -1.
If it is, it returns leftSum + rightSum + 1.
If it is not, it returns leftSum + rightSum + 1.
After the if statement finishes, it returns the value of the return statement of the method rec.
After the method rec finishes, it prints the value of the return statement of the method rec as output, which is 1.
