he variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4000, 2000 and 500 respectively according to the input.
It checks if A is greater than or equal to K. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If it is not, it checks if A is less than or equal to B. If it is, it prints -1 as output.
If it is not, it checks if (K - A) is divisible by (A - B). If it is, it prints ((K - A) / (A - B)) * 2 + 1 as output.
If it is not, it prints ((K - A) / (A - B)) * 2 + 3 as output.
