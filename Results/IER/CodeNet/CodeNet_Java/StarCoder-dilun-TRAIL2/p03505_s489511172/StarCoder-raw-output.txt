he variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4000, 2000 and 500 respectively according to the input.
It checks if A is greater than or equal to K. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If it is not, it checks if A is less than or equal to B. If it is, it prints -1 as output.
If it is not, it checks if (K - A) is divisible by (A - B). If it is, it prints ((K - A) / (A - B)) * 2 + 1 as output.
If it is not, it prints ((K - A) / (A - B)) * 2 + 3 as output.
<<<Output>>>
-1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = in.nextInt();
        int M = in.nextInt();
        int K = in.nextInt();

        int[] arr = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            arr[i] = in.nextInt();
        }

        int[] dp = new int[M + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = M; j >= arr[i]; j--) {
                dp[j] += dp[j - arr[i]];
            }
        }

        System.out.println(dp[M]);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 10 5
1 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable M and variable K are initialized with 3, 10 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It initializes an array of size N with all elements initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N -
