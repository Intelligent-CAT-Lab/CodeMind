he variable x1 and variable x2 are initialized with 20 and 30 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the absolute value of the difference between x1 and x2 and prints it as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{

	public static void main(String args[]) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x = scan.nextInt();
		int y = scan.nextInt();
		int z = scan.nextInt();

		if (x > y && x > z) {
			System.out.println(x);
		} else if (y > x && y > z) {
			System.out.println(y);
		} else {
			System.out.println(z);
		}

		scan.close();
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 30 40
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 20, 30 and 40 respectively according to the input.
It checks if x is greater than y and x is greater than z. If it is true, it prints x as output.
If it is not true, it checks if y is greater than x and y is greater than z. If it is true, it prints y as output.
If it is not true, it prints z as output.
<<<Output>>>
40
