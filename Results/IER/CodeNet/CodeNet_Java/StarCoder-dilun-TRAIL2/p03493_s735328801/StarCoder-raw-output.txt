he variable s is initialized with the input string "101".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable counter.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of the string s is equal to '1'. If it is, it increments the value of variable counter by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable counter as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
			sum += i;
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the value of variable n. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 55.
<<<Output>>>
55
