he variable N, variable K and variable M are initialized with 2, 2 and 100 respectively according to the input.
The variable transit is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of transit[i][j] by adding the value of transit[i - 1][j] and transit[i][j - 1] * (i + 1).
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to N to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[newVal][used + use] by adding the value of dp[newVal - 1][used] and dp[newVal][used + use] * transit[used][use].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of dp[K][N] as output, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    (new Main()).solve();
  }

  void solve() {

    try (
      Scanner cin = new Scanner(System.in);
    ) {

    	int N = cin.nextInt();
    	int K = cin.nextInt();
    	int M = cin.nextInt();
    	
    	// used lesser integer * use current integer;
    	int transit[][] = new int[N + 1][N + 1];
    	transit[0][0] = 1;
    	for( int i = 0; i <= N; ++ i ) {
    		for( int j = 0; i + j <= N; ++j ) {
    			if( i > 0 ) {
    				transit[i][j] = (transit[i][j] + transit[i - 1][j]) % M;
    			}
    			if( j > 0 ) {
        			transit[i][j] = (int)((transit[i][j] + transit[i][j
