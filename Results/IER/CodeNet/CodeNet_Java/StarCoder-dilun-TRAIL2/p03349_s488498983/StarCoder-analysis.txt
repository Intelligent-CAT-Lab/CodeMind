he variable N, variable K and variable M are initialized with 2, 2 and 100 respectively according to the input.
The variable transit is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of transit[i][j] by adding the value of transit[i - 1][j] and transit[i][j - 1] * (i + 1).
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to N to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[newVal][used + use] by adding the value of dp[newVal - 1][used] and dp[newVal][used + use] * transit[used][use].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of dp[K][N] as output, which is 100.
