he variable n is initialized with 6 and variable k is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calls the method search(i, k - 1, n) to calculate the number of ways to arrange the digits of the current interger num.
The method search(i, k - 1, n) calls itself recursively to calculate the number of ways to arrange the digits of the current interger num.
The method search(i, k - 1, n) returns the number of ways to arrange the digits of the current interger num.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable total as output, which is 10.
