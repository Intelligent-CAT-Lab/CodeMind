e variable x is initialized with 2 and variable y is initialized with 1.
It checks if y is in the range [0, 1]. If it is, it sets variable ans to 1.
If y is not in the range [0, 1], it checks if y is in the range [1, 3]. If it is, it sets variable ans to 0.
If y is not in the range [1, 3], it checks if y is in the range [3, 5]. If it is, it sets variable ans to 1.
After the checks, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
	{
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out)));
		StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
		int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
			arr[i] = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
		int ans = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
			for(int j = i+1; j < n; j++)
				if(arr[i] > arr[j])
					ans++;
		pw.println(ans);
		br.close();
		pw.close();
		System.exit(0);
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1
2
3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also
