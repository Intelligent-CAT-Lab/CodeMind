e variable x is initialized with 2 and variable y is initialized with 1.
It checks if y is in the range [0, 1]. If it is, it sets variable ans to 1.
If y is not in the range [0, 1], it checks if y is in the range [1, 3]. If it is, it sets variable ans to 0.
If y is not in the range [1, 3], it checks if y is in the range [3, 5]. If it is, it sets variable ans to 1.
After the checks, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 0.
