variable S is initialized with 010.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of variable S. The value of variable border is also passed to variable mid.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the previous character of the current interger border-1 is not equal to the current character of the current interger border.
If it is not, it calls the method mid(border) to calculate the mid point of the current string S.
If the method mid(border) returns a value, it stores it in variable mid.
After the loop finishes, it checks if variable mid is equal to -1. If it is, it returns the length of variable S as output.
If it is not, it returns the difference between the length of variable S and variable mid as output.
