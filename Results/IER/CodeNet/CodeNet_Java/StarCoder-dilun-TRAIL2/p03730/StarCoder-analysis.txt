he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 7, 5 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i and variable a and then checks if the product is divisible by variable b. If it is, it prints "YES" and returns.
If the loop finishes without printing "YES", it prints "NO".
