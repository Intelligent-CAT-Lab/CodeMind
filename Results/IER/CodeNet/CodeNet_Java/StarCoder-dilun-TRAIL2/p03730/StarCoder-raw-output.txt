he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 7, 5 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i and variable a and then checks if the product is divisible by variable b. If it is, it prints "YES" and returns.
If the loop finishes without printing "YES", it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();

		int count = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			int x = sc.nextInt();
			if (x >= a && x <= b) {
				count++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 10 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 5, 1, 10 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it reads an integer x from the input and checks if the value of x falls within the range [1, 10]. If it does, it increments variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output
