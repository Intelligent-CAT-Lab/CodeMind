e variable N is initialized with 5.
The array a is initialized with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is equal to the next integer i + 1. If it is, it skips the current iteration and goes to the next iteration.
If the current interger i is not equal to the next integer i + 1, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i to N - 1 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable k + 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger k is equal to the next integer k + 1. If it is, it skips the current iteration and goes to the next iteration.
If the current interger k is not equal to the next integer k + 1, it checks if the current interger i is less than the next integer k. If it is, it checks if the current interger i is less than the next integer k + 1. If it is, it increments the variable 山腹 by 1.
If the current interger i is not less than the next integer k, it checks if the current interger i is greater than the next integer k. If it is, it checks if the current interger i is greater than the next integer k + 1. If it is, it increments the variable 山腹 by 1.
If the current interger i is less than the next integer k, it checks if the current interger i is greater than the next integer k. If it is, it checks if the current interger i is less than the next integer k + 1. If it is, it increments the variable 盆地 by 1.
If the current interger i is greater than the next integer k, it checks if the current interger i is less than the next integer k. If it is, it checks if the current interger i is greater than the next integer k + 1. If it is, it increments the variable 高原 by 1.
If the current interger i is greater than the
