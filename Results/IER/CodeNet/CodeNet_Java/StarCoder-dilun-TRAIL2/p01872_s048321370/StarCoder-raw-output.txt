he variable str is initialized with the input.
The variable ctr is initialized with the string str converted to an array of characters.
The variable num is initialized with an array of 12 elements.
The variable v is initialized with 0.
The variable cnt is initialized with 0.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to the length of the array ctr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is '?'. If it is, it sets the variable v to 11 - i.
Otherwise, it sets the value of the element at index 11 - i of the array num to the value of the current character - '0'.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 9.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the variable sum to 0. It also initializes the variable q to 0.
If j is less than or equal to 6, it sets the value of q to j + 1.
Otherwise, it sets the value of q to j - 5.
It calculates the value of sum by adding the product of q and the value of the element at index j of the array num to the value of sum.
It checks if the value of sum is divisible by 11. If it is, it sets the value of sum to 0.
Otherwise, it sets the value of sum to the remainder of the division of sum by 11.
It calculates the value of the remainder of the division of (11 - sum) by 11.
It checks if the value of the remainder is equal to the value of the element at index 0 of the array num.
If it is, it increments the value of the variable cnt by 1.
It also sets the value of the variable ans to the value of i.
After the for loop finishes, it checks if the value of the variable cnt is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of the variable ans.
Otherwise, it prints MULTIPLE.
