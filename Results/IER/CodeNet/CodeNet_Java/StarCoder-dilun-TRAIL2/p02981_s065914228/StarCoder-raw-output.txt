he variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 2 and 9 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with the minimum of A*N and B.
The value of ans is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();

        int ans = Math.min(A*N, B);

        System.out.println(ans);

    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 9
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
