he variable A is initialized with 1 and variable B is initialized with 2.
The code enters a while loop and it checks if there are more inputs.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of the final output and prints it as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        while (sc.hasNextInt()) {
            int A = sc.nextInt();
            int B = sc.nextInt();

            System.out.printf("%.10f\n", B * B * B * Math.PI / 3.0 * 4.0);
        }
    }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
