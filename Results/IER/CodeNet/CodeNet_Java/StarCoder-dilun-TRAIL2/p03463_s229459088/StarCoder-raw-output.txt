he variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the difference between b and a is even or odd. If it is even, it prints "Alice". If it is odd, it prints "Borys".
<<<Output>>>
Borys
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
		Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = scn.nextInt();
		int a = scn.nextInt();
      	int b = scn.nextInt();
      	if(n%2==0) System.out.println("Alice");
      	else System.out.println("Borys");
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
