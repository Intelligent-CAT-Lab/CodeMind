he variable s is initialized with a Scanner object.
The Scanner object is initialized with the input 4 5.
The Scanner object is passed to the method nextInt() twice.
The first nextInt() method call returns 4 and the second nextInt() method call returns 5.
The first integer is compared with the second integer.
The first integer is greater than the second integer, so the output is "safe".
