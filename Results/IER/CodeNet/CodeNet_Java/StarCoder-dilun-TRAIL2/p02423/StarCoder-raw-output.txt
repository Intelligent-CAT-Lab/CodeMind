e variable x is initialized with 8.
The variable twobit is initialized with the binary string of x.
The variable left is initialized with the binary string of x left shifted by 1.
The variable right is initialized with the binary string of x right shifted by 1.
The variable twobit is converted to a 32-bit binary string by calling the method to32.
The variable twobit is printed.
The variable left is printed.
The variable right is printed.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)){
			int n = sc.nextInt();
			int[] arr = new int[n];
			for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
				arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
			}
			int max = arr[0];
			int min = arr[0];
			for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {
				if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
				if (arr[i] < min) min = arr[i];
			}
			System.out.println(max);
			System.out.println(min);
		}
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
An array of size n is
