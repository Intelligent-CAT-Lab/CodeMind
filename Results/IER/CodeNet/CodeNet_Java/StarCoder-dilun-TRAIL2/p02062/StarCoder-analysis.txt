he code first creates a parser object with the input string.
Then it calls the method getFormula() of the parser object to get the root node of the formula.
The root node is passed to the method get0() of the root node to get the cost of the formula when the value of the formula is 0.
The root node is passed to the method get1() of the root node to get the cost of the formula when the value of the formula is 1.
The final output is the cost of the formula when the value of the formula is 0 and the cost of the formula when the value of the formula is 1, separated by a space.
