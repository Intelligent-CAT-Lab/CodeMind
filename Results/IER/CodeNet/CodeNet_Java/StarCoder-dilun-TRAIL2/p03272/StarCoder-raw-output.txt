he variable N is initialized with 4 and variable K is initialized with 2.
The code calculates the difference between N and K and prints the result.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int N=sc.nextInt();
        int K=sc.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println(N-K+1);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
