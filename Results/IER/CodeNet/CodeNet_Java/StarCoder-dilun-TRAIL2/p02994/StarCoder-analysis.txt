he variable n is initialized with 5 and variable l is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable value.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the absolute value of variable value.
Then it adds the current interger i to variable diff.
After the loop finishes, it finds the index of the minimum value of variable diff and adds 1 to it.
Then it calculates the final value of the expression n*l + n*(n+1)/2 - n - (l+ removeK -1) and prints it as output.
