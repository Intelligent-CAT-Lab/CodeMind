he variable A is initialized with 3, variable B is initialized with 5 and variable C is initialized with 4.
The if statement checks if A is greater than C or if A + B is less than C.
If the condition is met, it prints "YES" as output.
If the condition is not met, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int A = sc.nextInt();
		int B = sc.nextInt();
		int C = sc.nextInt();
		
		if (A > C && A + B > C) {
			System.out.println("YES");
		} else {
			System.out.println("NO");
		}
		
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
