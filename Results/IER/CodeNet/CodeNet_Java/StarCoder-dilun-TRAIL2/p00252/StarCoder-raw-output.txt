he variable a is initialized with 3 integers.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger a[i] is equal to 1. If it is, it checks if the current interger a[i] is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "Open".
If the current interger a[i] is not equal to 1, it checks if the current interger a[i] is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "Open".
If the current interger a[i] is not equal to 1, it prints "Close".
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is "Close".
<<<Output>>>
Close

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(System.in);
		int[] a = new int[3];
		for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
			a[i] = stdIn.nextInt();
		}
		if(a[0] == 1 && a[1] == 1) {
			System.out.println("Open");
		}
		else if(a[2] == 1) {
			System.out.println("Open");
		}
		else {
			System.out.println("Close");
		}
		
	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
