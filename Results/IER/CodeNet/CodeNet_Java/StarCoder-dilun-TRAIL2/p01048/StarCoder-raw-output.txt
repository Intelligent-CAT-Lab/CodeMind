he variable i is initialized with 1.
It checks if the value of variable i is in the range [0, 12]. If it is, it prints the value of the array ans at index i as output, which is 60.
<<<Output>>>
60

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		@SuppressWarnings("resource")
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int[] ans = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 16, 12, 64, 24, 36, 48, 1024, 60};
		int i = sc.nextInt();

		System.out.println(ans[i]);
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
