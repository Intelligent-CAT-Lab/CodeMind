he variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to print each character of the string s.
The condition is met when i is 0,1 and 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl characters of the string s as output, which is tak.
<<<Output>>>
tak

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.nextLine();
        
        for(int i = 0;i < 3;i++)System.out.print(s.charAt(i));
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```takahashi
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
