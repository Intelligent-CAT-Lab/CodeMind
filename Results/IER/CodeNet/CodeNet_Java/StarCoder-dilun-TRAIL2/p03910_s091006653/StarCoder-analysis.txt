he variable N is initialized with 4.
The variable res is initialized with 1.
The variable sum is initialized with 1.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the value of variable sum is equal to the value of variable N. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If the value of variable sum is not equal to the value of variable N, it adds 1 to the value of variable res and adds the value of variable res to the value of variable sum.
If the value of variable sum is greater than the value of variable N, it subtracts the value of variable res from the value of variable sum.
If the value of variable sum is less than the value of variable N, it adds 1 to the value of the last element of the array ans.
The value of variable len is calculated by subtracting the value of variable N from the value of variable sum.
The for loop is entered and it iterates from 1 to the value of variable res. The value of variable i is passed to the variable j.
Inside the for loop, it adds 1 to the value of the element of the array ans at index j.
After the loop finishes, it prints the array ans as output.
