he variable k and variable s are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer x in this range. The value of variable x is also passed to variable y.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer y in this range. The value of variable y is also passed to variable s.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the calculated variable s falls within the range [0, 2]. If it does, it adds 1 to variable count. The condition is met when s is 0,1,2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int count=0;
		for(int x=0; x<=n; x++) {
			for(int y=0; y<=n; y++) {
				if(x+y==n) {
					count++;
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}

}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer x in this range. The value of variable x is also passed to variable y.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer y in this range. The value of variable y is also passed to variable n.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the calculated variable
