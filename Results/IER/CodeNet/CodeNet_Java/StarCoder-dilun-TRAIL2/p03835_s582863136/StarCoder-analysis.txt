he variable k and variable s are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer x in this range. The value of variable x is also passed to variable y.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer y in this range. The value of variable y is also passed to variable s.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the calculated variable s falls within the range [0, 2]. If it does, it adds 1 to variable count. The condition is met when s is 0,1,2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
