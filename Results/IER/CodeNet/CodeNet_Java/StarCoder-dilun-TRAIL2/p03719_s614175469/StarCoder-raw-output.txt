he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable c is within the range [1, 3]. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int c = sc.nextInt();
    if(c >= a && c <= b){
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }
    else
      System.out.println("No");
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
