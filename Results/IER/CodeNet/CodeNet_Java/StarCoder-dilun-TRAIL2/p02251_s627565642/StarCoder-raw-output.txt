he variable n is initialized with 100.
The variable result is initialized with 0.
The variable n is divided by 25 and the remainder is stored in variable n.
The variable result is incremented by the quotient of the division.
The variable n is divided by 10 and the remainder is stored in variable n.
The variable result is incremented by the quotient of the division.
The variable n is divided by 5 and the remainder is stored in variable n.
The variable result is incremented by the quotient of the division.
The variable result is incremented by the remainder of the division.
The final value of variable result is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.ArrayList;

 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        try {
	    int n=Integer.parseInt(reader.readLine());
	    int result=0;
	    
		result=n/25;
		n=n%25;
		result+=n/10;
		n=n%10;
		result+=n/5;
		n=n%5;
	    
		
	    System.out.println(result+n);
            reader.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    static int gcd (int a, int b){
	return b>0?gcd(b,a%b):a;
    }
    static int lcm (int a, int b) {
	return a*b/gcd(a,b);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 100.
The variable result is initialized with 0.
The variable n is divided by 25 and the remainder is stored in variable
