he variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input.
The method primeFactorize is called with parameter n.
The method primeFactorize returns a TreeMap<Integer, Integer> object which contains the prime factors of n.
The TreeMap<Integer, Integer> object is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
12: 2 2 3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    static BufferedReader in;
    static PrintWriter out;
    static StringTokenizer tok;

    void solve() throws IOException {
        int n = ni();

        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = ni();
        }

        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = arr[0];
        dp[1] = Math.max(arr[0], arr[1]);
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 2] + arr[i], dp[i - 1]);
        }

        out.println(dp[n - 1]);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        out = new PrintWriter(System.out);
        tok = new StringTokenizer("");
        Main main = new Main();
        main.solve();
        out.close();
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
An array of size n is created and initialized with 0.
The array is filled with the input values.
An array of size n is created and initialized with 0.
The first two elements of the array are initialized with the first two input values.
