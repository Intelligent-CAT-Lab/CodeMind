he variable x1, y1, x2 and y2 are initialized with 0, 0, 0 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable v1x is initialized with x2 - x1, and variable v1y is initialized with y2 - y1.
The variable x4 is initialized with -v1y + x1, and variable y4 is initialized with v1x + y1.
The variable v2x is initialized with x1 - x4, and variable v2y is initialized with y1 - y4.
The variable x3 is initialized with -v2y + x4, and variable y3 is initialized with v2x + y4.
After the variables are initialized, it prints the values of x3, y3, x4 and y4 as output, which is 0 1 0 0.
<<<Output>>>
0 1 0 0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x1 = scan.nextInt();
		int y1 = scan.nextInt();
		int x2 = scan.nextInt();
		int y2 = scan.nextInt();
		scan.close();
		int l = (int)Math.sqrt((x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2));
		int v1x = x2 - x1;
		int v1y = y2 - y1;
		int x4 = -v1y + x1;
		int y4 = v1x + y1;
		int v2x = x1 - x4;
		int v2y = y1 - y4;
		int x3 = -v2y + x4;
		int y3 = v2x + y4;

		System.out.println(l);


	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0 0 1
```
First analyze step by step about how
