he variable x1, y1, x2 and y2 are initialized with 0, 0, 0 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable v1x is initialized with x2 - x1, and variable v1y is initialized with y2 - y1.
The variable x4 is initialized with -v1y + x1, and variable y4 is initialized with v1x + y1.
The variable v2x is initialized with x1 - x4, and variable v2y is initialized with y1 - y4.
The variable x3 is initialized with -v2y + x4, and variable y3 is initialized with v2x + y4.
After the variables are initialized, it prints the values of x3, y3, x4 and y4 as output, which is 0 1 0 0.
