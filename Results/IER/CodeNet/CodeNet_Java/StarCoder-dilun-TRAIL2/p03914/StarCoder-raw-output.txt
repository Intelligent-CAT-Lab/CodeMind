he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable m is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters a second for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it enters a third for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer k in this range.
Inside the third for loop, it calculates the value of variable dp[a][b] by multiplying the value of dp[a][b] with the value of a, b and n-a-b.
Then it adds the value of dp[a][b] to the value of dp[a+b][0], dp[a][b+1] and dp[a][b] respectively.
After the third for loop finishes, it updates the value of dp with the value of next.
After the second for loop finishes, it updates the value of dp with the value of next.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the value of dp[n][0] as output, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static long MOD = 1000000007;
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();
		long[][] dp = new long[n+1][n+1];
		dp[1][0] = 1;
		for(int i=0;i<m;i++) {
			long[][] next = new long[n+1][n+1];
			for(int a=0;a<=n;a++) {
				for(int b=0;b<=n;b++) {
					if (dp[a][b] == 0) continue;
					next[a+b][0] = (next[a+b][0] + dp[a][b] * a) % MOD;
					next[a
