he variable int1 is initialized with 3 and variable int2 is initialized with 4.
The variable temp_int1 is initialized with 0.
The variable ans_int is initialized with 0.
The variable ans is initialized with an empty string.
The variable temp_str1 is initialized with an empty string.
The variable temp_str2 is initialized with an empty string.
The variable str1 is initialized with an empty string.
The variable ans_dob is initialized with 0.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp_int1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger temp_int1 and variable int2 and stores it in variable ans_int.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans_int as output, which is 12.
