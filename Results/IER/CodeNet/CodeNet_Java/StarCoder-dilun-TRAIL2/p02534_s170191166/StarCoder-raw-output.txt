he variable t is initialized with 3.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 3 to 0 to check each integer t in this range.
Inside the while loop, it appends the string "ACL" to the variable sb.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sb as output, which is "ACLACLACL".
<<<Output>>>
ACLACLACL

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
	 public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int t = sc.nextInt();
		int a = 0;
		int b = 0;
		int c = 0;
		while(t-->0) {
			int n = sc.nextInt();
			if(n%2==0) {
				a++;
			}
			else if(n%3==0) {
				b++;
			}
			else if(n%4==0) {
				c++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(a+" "+b+" "+c);
		sc.close();
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1
2
3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable t is initialized with 3.
The variables a, b and c are initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 3 to 0 to check each integer t in this range.
Inside the while loop, it initializes the variable n with the next integer in the input.
Then it checks if the current integer n is evenly divisible by 2. If it is, it increments the value of variable a by 1.
Then it checks if the current integer n is evenly divisible by 3. If it is, it increments the value of variable b by 1.
Then it checks if the current integer n is evenly divisible by 4. If it is, it increments
