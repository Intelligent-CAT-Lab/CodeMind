e variable n, variable x and variable y are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the minimum value of the current interger j-i, the minimum value of the absolute value of the difference between variable x and variable i plus the absolute value of the difference between variable y and variable j, and the minimum value of the absolute value of the difference between variable y and variable i plus the absolute value of the difference between variable x and variable j.
Then it prints the value of the current interger i as output.
