he variable A is initialized with 5, variable B is initialized with 4 and variable K is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to K/2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable A.
Inside the for loop, it divides variable A by 2.
Then it calculates the average of variable A and variable B by dividing it by 2.
Then it adds the calculated value to variable B.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable K is odd or even. If it is odd, it divides variable A by 2.
Then it adds the calculated value to variable B.
Finally, it prints the values of variables A and B as output, which is 2 3.
<<<Output>>>
2 3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
class Main{
   public static void main(String[] args){
      Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
      int A=sc.nextInt();
      int B=sc.nextInt();
      int K=sc.nextInt();
      for(int i=1;i<=K/2;i++){
         A=A/2;
         B=(A+B)/2;
         A=A+B;
     }if(K%2==1){
         A=A/2;
         B=A+B;
     }System.out.println(A+" "+B);
  }
}    


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
