he variable n is initialized with 2.
The value of variable n is passed to the Math.pow() method to calculate the cube of n.
The result of the calculation is stored in variable a.
The value of variable a is passed to the System.out.println() method to print the result.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		sc.close();
		int a=n*n;
			System.out.println(a);

	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
