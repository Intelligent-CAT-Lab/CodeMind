he variable s is initialized with the input string. The variable ch is initialized with the character array of s. The variable x is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ch.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of the string s is either '+' or '-'. If it is, it increments or decrements variable x by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scan.nextInt();
    int a[] = new int[n];
    for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++)
      a[i] = scan.nextInt();
    int x = 0 ;
    for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){
      if(a[i] > 0)
        x++;
      else if(a[i]<0)
        x--;
    }
    System.out.println(x) ;
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer. The variable a is initialized with an array of n integers.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the integer at index i of the array a is either positive or negative. If it is, it increments or decrements variable x by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x as output, which is 5.
