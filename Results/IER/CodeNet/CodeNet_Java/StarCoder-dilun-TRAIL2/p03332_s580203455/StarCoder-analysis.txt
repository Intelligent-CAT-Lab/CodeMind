he variable n, variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized with 4, 1, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The variable comb is initialized with an array of size n+1.
The variable q is initialized with K + A.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable q by subtracting A from it.
Then it checks if the value of variable q is divisible by B. If it is, it calculates the value of variable y by dividing q by B.
If the value of variable y is greater than n, it skips the current iteration of the for loop.
If the value of variable y is less than 0, it breaks out of the for loop.
Otherwise, it adds the value of variable comb[x] * comb[(int)y] to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
