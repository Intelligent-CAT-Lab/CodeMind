e variable h, variable w, variable a and variable b are initialized with 3, 3, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is greater than or equal to variable b. If it is, it fills the array with 0 to variable a and 1 to variable w.
Otherwise, it fills the array with 1 to variable a and variable w.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters a second for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it prints the value of array[i][j] as output.
