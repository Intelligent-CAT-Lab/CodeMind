he variable weeks is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the yield of the current interger i by multiplying it with 0.05.
Then it checks if the calculated variable yield is divisible by 1000. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
Otherwise, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 100000.
