TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();

    System.out.println(a + b);

  }

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The code calculates the sum of a and b and prints the result as output.
