he variable s is initialized with the input string "pdbq".
The variable arr is initialized with the character array of s.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of arr is equal to 'b'. If it is, it replaces the character at index i of arr with 'd'.
If the character at index i of arr is equal to 'd', it replaces the character at index i of arr with 'b'.
If the character at index i of arr is equal to 'p', it replaces the character at index i of arr with 'q'.
If the character at index i of arr is equal to 'q', it replaces the character at index i of arr with 'p'.
After the loop finishes, it creates a new string builder object sb with the character array arr.
Then it reverses the string in the string builder object sb.
Then it checks if the string in the string builder object sb is equal to the string s. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max = arr[0];
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			if (arr[i] > max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
		}
		int count = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			if (arr[i] == max) {
				count++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}
