he variable X is initialized with 103.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable h is less than the value of variable X.
Inside the while loop, it multiplies the value of variable h by 1.01 to increase the value of h by 1%.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		long X=sc.nextLong();

		long h =100L;
		int count = 0;
		sc.close();

		while(h < X) {
			h *= 1.01;
			count++;
		}

		System.out.println(count);




	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
