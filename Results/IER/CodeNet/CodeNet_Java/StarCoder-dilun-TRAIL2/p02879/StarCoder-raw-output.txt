he variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if the values of A and B are greater than 9. If they are, it prints -1 as output.
If the values of A and B are not greater than 9, it prints the product of A and B as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main main = new Main();
        main.solve();
    }
    public void solve() {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)));
        int A = scan.nextInt();
        int B = scan.nextInt();
        if (A == 0) {
            System.out.println(1);
            return;
        }
        System.out.println(A * B);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized with 0 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if the value of A is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If the value of A is not equal to 0, it prints the product of A and B as output.
