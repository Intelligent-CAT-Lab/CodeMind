he variable s is initialized with the input string "redcoder".
The variable len is initialized with the length of the string s.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to len/2-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable res.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of the string s is not equal to the character at index len-1-i of the string s. If it is not, it adds 1 to variable res.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 2.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
    String s=sc.next();
    System.out.println(fun(s));
  }
  public static int fun(String s){
    int len=s.length(),res=0;
    for(int i=0;i<len/2;i++){
      if(s.charAt(i)!=s.charAt(len-1-i)) res++;
    }
    return res;
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```redcoder
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
