he variable m, variable f and variable b are initialized with 1000, 3000 and 3000 respectively according to the input.
It checks if m is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
If m is less than b, it checks if m + f is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it prints b - m as output.
If m + f is less than b, it prints "NA" as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = scan.nextInt();
        int a = scan.nextInt();
        int b = scan.nextInt();

        if (a >= b) {
            System.out.println(0);
        } else if (a + n >= b) {
            System.out.println(b - a);
        } else {
            System.out.println("NA");
        }
    }

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000 3000 3000
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 1000, 3000 and 3000 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
If a is less than b, it checks if a + n is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it prints b - a as output.
If a + n is less than b, it prints "NA" as output.
