e variable s is initialized with the input.
The variable dp is initialized with a 2D array of size 5x(length of s + 1).
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 and i < length of s to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i > 1 and s.charAt(0) == '0'. If it does, it breaks out of the inner for loop.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i == 3 and Integer.parseInt(s.substring(0, 3)) > 255. If it does, it breaks out of the inner for loop.
Inside the for loop, it adds the value of getCount(size - 1, s.substring(i, s.length())) to variable ans.
After the for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
