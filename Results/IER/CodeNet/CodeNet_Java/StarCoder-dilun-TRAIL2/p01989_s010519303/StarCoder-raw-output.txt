e variable s is initialized with the input.
The variable dp is initialized with a 2D array of size 5x(length of s + 1).
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 and i < length of s to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i > 1 and s.charAt(0) == '0'. If it does, it breaks out of the inner for loop.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i == 3 and Integer.parseInt(s.substring(0, 3)) > 255. If it does, it breaks out of the inner for loop.
Inside the for loop, it adds the value of getCount(size - 1, s.substring(i, s.length())) to variable ans.
After the for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.next();
		int n = s.length();
		int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		    dp[i + 1] = dp[i] + (s.charAt(i) == '1'? 1 : 0);
		}
		int ans = 0;
		for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		    for (int j = i; j <= n; j++) {
		        if (dp[j] - dp[i - 1] == j - i) {
		            ans++;
		        }
		    }
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}
