he variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 3.
The if statement checks if k is greater than or equal to a. If it is, it subtracts k from a and assigns the result to b. If it is not, it subtracts k from a and assigns the result to a.
The if statement checks if b is less than 0. If it is, it assigns 0 to b.
After the if statements, it prints the values of a and b as output, which is 0 0.
