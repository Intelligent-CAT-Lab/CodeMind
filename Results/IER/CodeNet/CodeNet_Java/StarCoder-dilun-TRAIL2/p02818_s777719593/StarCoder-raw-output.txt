he variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 3.
The if statement checks if k is greater than or equal to a. If it is, it subtracts k from a and assigns the result to b. If it is not, it subtracts k from a and assigns the result to a.
The if statement checks if b is less than 0. If it is, it assigns 0 to b.
After the if statements, it prints the values of a and b as output, which is 0 0.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*; 

class Main{
public static void main(String[] args){
	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        long a=sc.nextLong();
        long b=sc.nextLong();
		long k=sc.nextLong();
	
 	if(k>=a){
      	b=b-(k-a);
        a=0;
    	}else{
     	a=a-k;
   	 }
	if(b<0){
    	b=0;
    }
    	System.out.println(a);
  		System.out.println(b);
    }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 4.
The if statement checks if k is greater than or equal to a. If it is, it subtracts k from a and assigns the result to b. If it is not, it subtracts k from a and assigns the result to a.
The if statement checks if b is less than 0. If it is, it assigns 0 to b.
After the if statements, it prints the values of a and b as output, which is 1 0.
