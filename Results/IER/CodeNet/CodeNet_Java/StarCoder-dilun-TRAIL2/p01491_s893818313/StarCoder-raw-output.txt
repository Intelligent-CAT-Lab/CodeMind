he variable M, variable N, variable m0, variable md, variable n0 and variable nd are initialized with 2, 3, 1, 3, 1 and 0 respectively according to the input.
The variable m is initialized with an array of length 2 with values 1 and 0.
The variable n is initialized with an array of length 3 with values 1, 0 and 0.
The for loop iterates from 1 to 2 to initialize the array m with values 1 and 3.
The for loop iterates from 1 to 3 to initialize the array n with values 1, 0 and 3.
The function sort is called to sort the array m with values 1 and 3.
The function sort is called to sort the array n with values 1, 0 and 3.
The variable accumN is initialized with an array of length 4 with values 0, 1, 1 and 1 respectively.
The variable accumM is initialized with an array of length 4 with values 0, 1, 1 and 1 respectively.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 3 to initialize the array accumN with values 0, 1, 1 and 2.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 3 to initialize the array accumM with values 0, 1, 1 and 2.
The variable cur is initialized with 3.
The variable sum is initialized with 1.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cur.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the condition accumN[cur] >=  accumN[cur - 1] +  (M - i) is met. If it is, it decrements variable cur.
The variable sum is updated with the minimum value of the current value of variable sum and the sum of the values of variables accumM[i], accumN[cur] and (N - cur) * (M - i).
The variable sum is printed as output.
