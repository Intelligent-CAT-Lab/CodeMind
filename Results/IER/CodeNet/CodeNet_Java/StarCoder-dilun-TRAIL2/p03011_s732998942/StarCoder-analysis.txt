ariable n is initialized with 3 integers 1, 3 and 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the two integers n[i] and n[j] and stores it in variable min.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 2.
