he variable N is initialized with 432 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 432 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable wk.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable wk by multiplying it with 1.08.
Then it checks if the calculated variable wk is equal to N. If it is, it prints the current interger i as output.
After the loop finishes, it prints the string ":(" as output.
