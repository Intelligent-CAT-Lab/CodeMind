he variable num is initialized with 2.
The value of variable num is passed to the function main() as an argument.
The function main() calculates the value of variable num to the power of 3 and prints the result.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		int num = Integer.valueOf(br.readLine());
		System.out.println(num*num*num);
	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
