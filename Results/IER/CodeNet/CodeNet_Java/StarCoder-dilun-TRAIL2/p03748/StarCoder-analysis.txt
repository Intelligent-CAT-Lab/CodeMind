he variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is initialized with 3.
The variable dp is initialized with 2-dimensional array of size 2 x (n+1) x 2.
The variable mod is initialized with 1000000007.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 times.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n+1 times.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 times.
Inside the third for loop, it checks if the current interger j is 0.
If it is, it checks if the current interger k is 0.
If it is, it sets the value of dp[(i+1)%2][0][0] to 0.
If it is not, it checks if the current interger k is 1.
If it is, it sets the value of dp[(i+1)%2][0][1] to (dp[i%2][0][1] + (dp[i%2][1][0] + dp[i%2][1][1])%mod)%mod.
If it is not, it checks if the current interger j is 1.
If it is, it checks if the current interger k is 0.
If it is, it checks if the current interger n is less than 2.
If it is, it sets the value of dp[(i+1)%2][1][0] to 0.
If it is not, it checks if the current interger n is less than 2.
If it is, it sets the value of dp[(i+1)%2][1][1] to (dp[i%2][1][0] + (dp[i%2][1][1]+dp[i%2][0][1])%mod)%mod.
If it is not, it checks if the current interger n is less than 2.
If it is, it sets the value of dp[(i+1)%2][1][1] to (((dp[i%2][1][0]+dp[i%2][0][1])%mod + dp[i%2][1][1]*2%mod)%mod + dp[i%2][2][1])%mod.
If it is not, it checks if the current interger j is less than n.
If it is, it sets the value of dp[(i+1)%2][j][k] to (dp[i%2][j][k]+dp[i%2][j-1][k])%mod.
If it is not, it checks if the current interger j is less than n.
If it is, it sets the value of dp[(i+1)%2][j][k] to (dp[(i+1)%2][j][k] + (dp[i%2][j][k]+dp[i%2][j+1][k])%mod)%mod.
After the third for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n+1 times.
Inside the fourth for loop, it checks if the current interger i is 0.
If it is, it sets the value of ans to 0.
If it is not, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n+1 times.
Inside the fifth for loop, it checks if the current interger i is 0.
If it is, it sets the value of ans to (ans + dp[m%2][i][1])%mod.
After the fifth for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output.
