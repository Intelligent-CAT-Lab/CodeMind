he variable n, variable x and variable t are initialized with 20, 12 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if n is divisible by x. If it is, it calculates the final value of variable ans by multiplying n/x by t.
If n is not divisible by x, it calculates the final value of variable ans by multiplying (n/x) + 1 by t.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    int x = sc.nextInt();
    int t = sc.nextInt();
    int ans;
    if (n%x == 0){
      ans = (n/x) * t;
    }else{
      int m =  n / x;
      ans = (m+1) *t;
    }
    System.out.println(ans);
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 12 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
