 variable s is initialized with the input string "Thank you for your mail and your lectures".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string s is already in the hashmap count. If it is not, it adds the current character to the hashmap count with a value of 1.
If the current character is already in the hashmap count, it replaces the value of the current character in the hashmap count with the current value of the current character in the hashmap count plus 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string s is already in the hashmap length. If it is not, it adds the current character to the hashmap length with a value of the length of the current character.
If the current character is already in the hashmap length, it replaces the value of the current character in the hashmap length with the current value of the current character in the hashmap length plus the length of the current character.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from the hashmap count's keyset.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current key of the hashmap count is greater than the variable max. If it is, it replaces the value of the variable max with the value of the current key of the hashmap count.
If the current key of the hashmap count is not greater than the variable max, it does nothing.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from the hashmap length's keyset.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current key of the hashmap length is greater than the variable maxlen. If it is, it replaces the value of the variable maxlen with the value of the current key of the hashmap length.
If the current key of the hashmap length is not greater than the variable maxlen, it does nothing.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of the variable m and the value of the variable mlen as output, which is "you 10".
<<<Output>>>
you 10
