variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string s is 'A' and if the current character of the string s is not equal to the current character of the string akihabara.
If the condition is met, it increments the value of variable j by 1.
Then it checks if the value of variable j is greater than or equal to the length of the string akihabara or if the current character of the string akihabara is not equal to the current character of the string s.
If the condition is met, it prints "NO" as output.
If the condition is not met, it checks if the current character of the string s is not equal to 'A'.
If the condition is met, it increments the value of variable k by 1.
Then it checks if the current character of the string s is equal to the current character of the string kihbr.
If the condition is met, it increments the value of variable k by 1.
Then it checks if the value of variable k is equal to the length of the string kihbr.
If the condition is met, it prints "YES" as output.
If the condition is not met, it prints "NO" as output.
