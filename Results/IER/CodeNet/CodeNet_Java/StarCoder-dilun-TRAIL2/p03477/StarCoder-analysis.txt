he variable left is initialized with 3 + 8 = 11 and variable right is initialized with 7 + 1 = 8.
Then it checks if the value of variable left is greater than the value of variable right. If it is, it prints "Left".
If the value of variable left is not greater than the value of variable right, it checks if the value of variable left is equal to the value of variable right. If it is, it prints "Balanced".
If the value of variable left is not equal to the value of variable right, it prints "Right".
