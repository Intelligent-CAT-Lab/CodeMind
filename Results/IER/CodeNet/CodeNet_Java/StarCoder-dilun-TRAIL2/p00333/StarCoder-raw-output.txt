he variable W, variable H and variable C are initialized with 10, 20 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The gcd function is called with parameters W and H.
The value returned by the gcd function is stored in variable WH.
The value of variable WH is multiplied by variable C to get the final value of variable a.
The final value of variable a is multiplied by variable C to get the final output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

    static int gcd(int x, int y) {
        if (y == 0) {
            return x;
        } else {
            return gcd(y, x % y);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int W = sc.nextInt();
        int H = sc.nextInt();
        int WH = gcd(W, H);
        int C = sc.nextInt();

        
        int a = (W/WH)*(H/WH);
        
        System.out.println(a*C);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 20 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
