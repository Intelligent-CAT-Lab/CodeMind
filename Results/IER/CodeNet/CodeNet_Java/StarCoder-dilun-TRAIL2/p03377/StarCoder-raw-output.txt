he variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 3, 5 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to x and if a is less than or equal to x.
If both conditions are met, it prints "YES" as output.
If either of the conditions is not met, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{

     public static void main(String []args){
         Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
         int a=s.nextInt();
         int b=s.nextInt();
         int x=s.nextInt();
         if(a+b>=x&&a<=x){
             System.out.println("YES");
         }
        
         else
         System.out.println("NO");
        
     }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
