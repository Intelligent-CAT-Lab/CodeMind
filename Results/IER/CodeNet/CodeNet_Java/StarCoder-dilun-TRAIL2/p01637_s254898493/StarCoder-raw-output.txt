he variable M is initialized with the value of the input.
The variable rd is initialized with the value of the input.
The variable rr is initialized with the value of the input.
The variable cd is initialized with the value of the input.
The variable cr is initialized with the value of the input.
The variable r is initialized with 0.
The variable l is initialized with 1000L * 1000L * 1000L * 1000L + 1.
The for loop iterates 1000 times. In each iteration, it calculates the mid value of the range [r, l] and assigns it to variable mid.
If the value of variable cd is less than or equal to the value of variable rd multiplied by the value of variable mid divided by 100, then the value of variable l is assigned to variable l.
Otherwise, the value of variable r is assigned to variable r.
The variable x is initialized with the value of variable l.
The variable r is initialized with 0.
The variable l is initialized with the value of variable M.
The for loop iterates 1000 times. In each iteration, it calculates the mid value of the range [r, l] and assigns it to variable mid.
If the value of variable cr is less than or equal to the value of variable rr multiplied by the value of variable mid divided by 100, then the value of variable l is assigned to variable l.
Otherwise, the value of variable r is assigned to variable r.
The variable y is initialized with the value of variable l.
If the value of variable x plus the value of variable y is greater than the value of variable M, then the value of -1 is printed as output.
Otherwise, the value of variable D is initialized with the value of variable rd multiplied by the value of variable x divided by 100.
The value of variable R is initialized with the value of variable rr multiplied by the value of variable y divided by 100.
The value of variable ans is initialized with the value of variable M minus the value of variable x minus the value of variable y.
If the value of variable D is less than the value of variable cd or the value of variable R is less than the value of variable cr, then the value of -1
