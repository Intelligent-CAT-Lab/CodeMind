The variable ruijyo is initialized with 0.
The if statement checks if the string str is empty. If it is, it exits the program.
The else statement checks if the bit at position ruijyo of variable res is 0. If it is, it calculates the next value of variable res by adding 1 to the remainder of res divided by ni_beki.
The else statement also increments the value of variable ruijyo by 1.
The else statement also calculates the next value of variable ni_beki by multiplying ni_beki by 2.
The final value of variable res is printed as output.
