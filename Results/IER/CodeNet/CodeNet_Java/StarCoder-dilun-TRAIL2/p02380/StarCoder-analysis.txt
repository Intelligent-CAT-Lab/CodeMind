he variable a, variable b and variable cc are initialized with 4, 3 and 90 respectively according to the input.
The variable s is initialized with the value of a * b * sin(cc) / 2.0.
The variable l is initialized with the value of a + b + sqrt(a * a + b * b - 2.0 * a * b * cos(cc)).
The variable h is initialized with the value of b * sin(cc).
The value of s, l and h are printed as output.
