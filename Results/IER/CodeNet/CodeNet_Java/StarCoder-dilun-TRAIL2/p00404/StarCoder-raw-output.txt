he variable x and variable y are initialized with 0 and 0 respectively according to the input.
The function search is called with the values of x and y as parameters.
The function search calculates the value of variable p by iterating from 0 to infinity.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the values of variables x_min, x_max, y_min and y_max fall within the range [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0] and [0, 0] respectively. If it does, it returns the value of p%3 + 1.
If the values of variables x_min, x_max, y_min and y_max do not fall within the range [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0] and [0, 0] respectively, it calculates the value of variable f by adding the values of variables f1 and f2.
If the value of variable p is divisible by 4, it adds the value of variable f to variable x_max.
If the value of variable p is divisible by 4, it adds the value of variable f to variable y_max.
If the value of variable p is divisible by 4, it subtracts the value of variable f from variable x_min.
If the value of variable p is divisible by 4, it subtracts the value of variable f from variable y_min.
If the value of variable p is not divisible by 4, it adds the value of variable f to variable f2.
If the value of variable p is not divisible by 4, it adds the value of variable f to variable f1.
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of p%3 + 1 as output, which is 1.
