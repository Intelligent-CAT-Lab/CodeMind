he variable in is initialized with an array of 3 integers. The first integer is 5, the second integer is 5 and the third integer is 7.
The array in is sorted in ascending order.
The condition is met when the first element of the array is 5, the second element of the array is 5 and the third element of the array is 7.
<<<Output>>>
YES
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    static Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
    public static void main(String __[]) {
        int in[]= {s.nextInt(),s.nextInt(),s.nextInt()};
        Arrays.sort(in);
        System.out.println(in[0]==5&&in[1]==5&&in[2]==7?"YES":"NO");

    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 5 7
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
