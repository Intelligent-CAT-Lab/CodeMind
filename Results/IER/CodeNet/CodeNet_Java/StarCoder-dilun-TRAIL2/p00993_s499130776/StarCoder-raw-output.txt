e variable m is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1499 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable m.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i and variable m.
After the loop finishes, it adds 2 to variable m.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the input is exhausted.
Inside the while loop, it reads the next integer n from the input.
It prints the value of variable m.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable m.
Inside the for loop, it prints the value of variable i+2.
After the loop finishes, it prints the fianl value of variable m as output, which is 1500.
