he variable s is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the length of the string s to 2. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the substring of s from index 0 to i/2 is equal to the substring of s from index i/2 to i. If it is, it prints the value of variable i as output.
