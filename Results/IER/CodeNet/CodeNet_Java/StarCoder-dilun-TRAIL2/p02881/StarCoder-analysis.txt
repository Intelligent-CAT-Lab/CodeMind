e variable n is initialized with 10.
The for loop iterates from 10 to 1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor of the current interger i and the variable n.
Then it checks if the calculated variable gcd is 1. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 9.
