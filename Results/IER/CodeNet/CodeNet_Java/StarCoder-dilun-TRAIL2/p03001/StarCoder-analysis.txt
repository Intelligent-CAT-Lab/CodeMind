he variable w, variable h, variable x and variable y are initialized with 2, 3, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with the value of w*h/2.
Then it checks if the sum of x and y is equal to w and h respectively. If it is, it sets variable a to 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans and variable a as output, which is 3.0 1.
