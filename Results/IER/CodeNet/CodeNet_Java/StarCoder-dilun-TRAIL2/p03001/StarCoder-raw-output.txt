he variable w, variable h, variable x and variable y are initialized with 2, 3, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with the value of w*h/2.
Then it checks if the sum of x and y is equal to w and h respectively. If it is, it sets variable a to 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans and variable a as output, which is 3.0 1.
<<<Output>>>
3.0 1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String [] Args)
	{
		Scanner in=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=in.nextInt();
		int a[]=new int[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
			a[i]=in.nextInt();
		int ans=0;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
			for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++)
				if(a[i]>a[j])
					ans++;
		System.out.println(ans);

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
Then it creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of a[i] is greater than a[j]. If it is, it increments variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output
