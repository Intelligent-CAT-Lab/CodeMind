he variable str is initialized with an empty string.
The variable chr is initialized with an array of length equal to the length of the string str.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string str to check each index i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it assigns the character at index i of the string str to the array chr at index i.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from the length of the string str to 0 to check each index i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it appends the character at index i of the array chr to the string ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is w32nimda.
<<<Output>>>
w32nimda

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

class Main{


	public static void main(String[] a){

        InputStreamReader is = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(is);


        String str = "";
        char[] chr;

		try {
			str = br.readLine();
			chr = new char[str.length()];

			for(int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
				 chr[i] = str.charAt(i);
			}

			String ans = "";

			for(int i = 0; i < chr.length; i++) {
				ans += chr[i];
			}
			System.out.println(ans);

		} catch (IOException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}

	}


}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```w32nimda
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
