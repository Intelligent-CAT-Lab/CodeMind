he variable str is initialized with an empty string.
The variable chr is initialized with an array of length equal to the length of the string str.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string str to check each index i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it assigns the character at index i of the string str to the array chr at index i.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from the length of the string str to 0 to check each index i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it appends the character at index i of the array chr to the string ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is w32nimda.
