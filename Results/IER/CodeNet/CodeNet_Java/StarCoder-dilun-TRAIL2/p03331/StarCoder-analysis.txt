he variable n is initialized with 15.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to n/2 to check each integer a in this range. The value of variable a is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a and b by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is less than the current value of variable ans. If it is, it updates the value of variable ans with the calculated variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
