he variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 10, 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The variable max is initialized with the minimum of a and b.
Then it checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it sets the value of variable min to the difference between a and b.
If the sum of a and b is less than n, it sets the value of variable min to 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max and variable min as output, which is 5 2.
