he variable S is initialized with the input string.
The variable replaced is initialized with the string S.
The method replace is called on the string S with the argument "eraser". This method replaces all the occurences of the substring "eraser" with an empty string.
The method replace is called on the string S with the argument "erase". This method replaces all the occurences of the substring "erase" with an empty string.
The method replace is called on the string S with the argument "dreamer". This method replaces all the occurences of the substring "dreamer" with an empty string.
The method replace is called on the string S with the argument "dream". This method replaces all the occurences of the substring "dream" with an empty string.
The method length is called on the string replaced. This method returns the length of the string.
The if statement checks if the length of the string replaced is 0. If it is, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
NO

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = sc.next();
        String replaced = S.replace("eraser", "").replace("erase", "").replace("dreamer", "").replace("dream", "");
        if(replaced.length() == 0) System.out.println("YES");
        else System.out.println("NO");
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```dreamdreamer
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
