e variable n is initialized with 117 according to the input.
It checks if the string representation of n contains the character 7. If it does, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = s.nextInt();
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                sum += i;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 and 11.
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 28.
<<<Output>>>
28
