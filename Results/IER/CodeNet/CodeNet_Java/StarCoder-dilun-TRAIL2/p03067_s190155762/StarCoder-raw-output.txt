he variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized with 3, 8 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if the following conditions are met:
A < C and C < B
B < C and C < A
If any of the conditions is met, it prints "Yes" as output.
If none of the conditions is met, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{

	public static void main(String[] args){

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        int C = sc.nextInt();
      
       if((A < C && C < B)||(B < C && C < A)){
         System.out.println("Yes");
       }else{
         System.out.println("No");
       }
	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
