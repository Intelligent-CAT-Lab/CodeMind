he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The code first checks if a is greater than or equal to b and a is greater than or equal to c. If it is true, it prints the sum of a and b.
If it is false, it checks if b is greater than or equal to a and b is greater than or equal to c. If it is true, it prints the sum of b and a.
If it is false, it checks if c is greater than or equal to a and c is greater than or equal to b. If it is true, it prints the sum of c and a.
If it is false, it checks if c is greater than or equal to b and c is greater than or equal to a. If it is true, it prints the sum of c and b.
