he code first creates a Scanner object and then enters a while loop.
Inside the while loop, it reads a line of input from the user and stores it in variable s.
Then it prints the value of variable s in upper case.
<<<Output>>>
THIS IS A PEN.
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try(Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)){
			while(sc.hasNext()) {
				String s = sc.nextLine();
				System.out.println(s.toLowerCase());
			}
		}
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```THIS IS A PEN.
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
