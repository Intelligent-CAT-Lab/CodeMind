he variable S is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character in the string S.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is equal to the variable S0. If it is, it increments the value of variable S0mas by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates through each character in the string S.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is equal to the variable S0. If it is, it increments the value of variable S0mas by 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable S0mas is less than the value of variable S1mas. If it is, it prints the product of the value of variable S0mas and 2 as output.
Otherwise, it prints the product of the value of variable S1mas and 2 as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = sc.next();
        sc.close();
        int S0mas = 0;
        int S1mas = 0;
        for(char str : S.toCharArray()){
            if(str == '0'){
                ++S0mas;
            }else{
                ++S1mas;
            }
        }
        if(S0mas < S1mas){
            System.out.println(S0mas * 2);
        }else{
            System.out.println(S1mas * 2);
        }
    }

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0011
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character in the string S.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is equal to '0'. If it is, it increments the value of variable S0mas by 1.
