he variable S is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character in the string S.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is equal to the variable S0. If it is, it increments the value of variable S0mas by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates through each character in the string S.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is equal to the variable S0. If it is, it increments the value of variable S0mas by 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable S0mas is less than the value of variable S1mas. If it is, it prints the product of the value of variable S0mas and 2 as output.
Otherwise, it prints the product of the value of variable S1mas and 2 as output.
