he variable n and variable m are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The value of variable n is passed to variable m.
The value of variable m is passed to the first term of the expression (1900 * m).
The value of variable n is passed to the second term of the expression (100 * (n - m)).
The value of variable m is passed to the third term of the expression (1<<m).
The value of variable m is passed to the fourth term of the expression (1<<m).
The final value of the expression is 190100.
<<<Output>>>
190100

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println((n - m) * (n - m + 1) / 2);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
