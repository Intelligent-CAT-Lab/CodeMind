he variable num is initialized with 3 according to the input.
The variable answer is initialized with 180 * (num - 2).
The final value of variable answer is printed as output, which is 540.
<<<Output>>>
540

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int num = sc.nextInt();

        int answer = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < num + 1; i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0) {
                answer += i;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(answer);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized with 10 according to the input.
The variable answer is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is divisible by 3 or 5. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 3,5,6,9 and 10.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 33.
<<<Output>>>
33
