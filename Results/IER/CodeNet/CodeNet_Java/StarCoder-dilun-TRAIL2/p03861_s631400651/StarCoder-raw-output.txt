he variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 4, 8 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with the value of (b / x) + 1.
The variable diff is initialized with the value of (a / x) + 1.
If a is divisible by x, then diff is decreased by 1.
The final value of variable sum is subtracted from diff and printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    long a = 0;
    long b = 0;
    long x = 0;
    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
      String[] tmp = br.readLine().split("\\s");
      a = Long.parseLong(tmp[0]);
      b = Long.parseLong(tmp[1]);
      x = Long.parseLong(tmp[2]);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
      System.exit(1);
    }

    long sum = (b / x) + 1;
    long diff = (a / x) + 1;
    if (a % x == 0) {
      diff--;
    }
    System.out.print(sum - diff);
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 8 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 4, 8 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with the value of (b / x) + 1.
The variable diff is initialized with the value of (a / x) + 1.
If a is divisible by x, then diff is decreased by 1.
The final value of variable sum is subtracted from diff and printed as output.
