he variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 4, 8 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with the value of (b / x) + 1.
The variable diff is initialized with the value of (a / x) + 1.
If a is divisible by x, then diff is decreased by 1.
The final value of variable sum is subtracted from diff and printed as output.
