TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.IOException;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        try (
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
                new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            final String s = reader.readLine();

            System.out.println(s.replace(" ", ","));
        }
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```happy newyear enjoy
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input.
