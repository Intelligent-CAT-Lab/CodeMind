he variable K is initialized with 2 and variable X is initialized with 900.
It checks if the value of variable X is less than or equal to 500 times K. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
 
class Main {
 
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int N = stdIn.nextInt();
		int X = stdIn.nextInt();

		if( N >= 1 && N <= 1000000 && X >= 1 && X <= 1000000000 ) {
			System.out.println("Yes");
		}else{
			System.out.println("No");
		}
	}
    
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000000 1000000000
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 1000000 and variable X is initialized with 1000000000.
It checks if the value of variable N is between 1 and 1000000 and if the value of variable X is between 1 and 1000000000. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
