he variable N is initialized with 20.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of N. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of N. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of N. The value of variable k is also passed to variable num.
Inside the third for loop, it calculates the sum of the squares of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is less than or equal to N. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 10.
