e variable height is initialized with 1 and variable width is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer common in this range. The value of variable common is also passed to variable ways.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of ways to fill the rectangle with height and width with common rows and common columns.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
