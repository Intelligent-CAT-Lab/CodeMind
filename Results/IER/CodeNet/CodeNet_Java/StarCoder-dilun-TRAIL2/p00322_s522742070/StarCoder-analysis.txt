e code first reads the input and splits it into words. Then it initializes a 4x3 array nums and a boolean array used.
Then it iterates through the words and assigns the values to the corresponding position in the array nums.
The value -1 is used to indicate that the corresponding position in the array nums is empty.
The code then enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 8 to check each index i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of the corresponding position in the array nums is -1.
If it is, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9 to check each integer k in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of boolean array used at index k is false.
If it is, it assigns the value k to the corresponding position in the array nums and assigns true to the boolean array used at index k.
Then it calls the function solve with the parameter idx = 0.
The function solve enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 8 to check each index idx in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of the corresponding position in the array nums is -1.
If it is, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9 to check each integer k in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of boolean array used at index k is false.
If it is, it assigns the value k to the corresponding position in the array nums and assigns true to the boolean array used at index k.
Then it calls the function solve with the parameter idx = 1.
The function solve enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 8 to check each index idx in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of the corresponding position in the array nums is -1.
If it is, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9 to check each integer k in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of boolean array used at index k is false.
If it is, it assigns the value k to the corresponding position in the array nums and assigns true to the boolean array used at index k.
Then it calls the function solve with the parameter idx = 2.
