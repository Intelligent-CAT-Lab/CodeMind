he variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if n and m are equal to 2. If they are, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it calculates the maximum value of n - 2 and m - 2 and prints the final value as output.
<<<Output>>>
0

public class Main {

    private Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

    void solve() {
        int n = in.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = in.nextInt();
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for(int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if(arr[i] > arr[j]) {
                    ans++;
                }
            }

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
Then it creates an array of size n and initializes each element with 0.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of arr[i] is greater than the value of arr[j]. If it is, it increments variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
