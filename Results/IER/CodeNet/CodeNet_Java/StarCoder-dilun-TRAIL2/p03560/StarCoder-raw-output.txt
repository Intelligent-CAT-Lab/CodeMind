he variable K is initialized with 6.
The variable dp is initialized with 6 elements, each of which is initialized with Integer.MAX_VALUE.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable v.
Inside the for loop, it assigns the value of variable i to the element of variable dp at index v.
Then it enters a while loop and it checks if the priority queue is empty.
Inside the while loop, it pops the first element of the priority queue and assigns it to variable node.
Then it assigns the value of variable node.to to the variable v.
Then it assigns the value of variable node.cost to the variable c.
If the value of variable c is greater than the value of element of variable dp at index v, it skips the rest of the loop.
Otherwise, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable nextv.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the next value of variable v by adding the value of variable v and variable i.
Then it calculates the next value of variable c by adding the value of variable c and variable i.
Then it checks if the value of element of variable dp at index nextv is greater than the value of variable c.
If it is, it assigns the value of variable c to the element of variable dp at index nextv.
Then it adds a new node with the value of variable nextv and variable nextc to the priority queue.
After the while loop finishes, it print the fianl value of element of variable dp at index 0 as output, which is 123456.
<<<Output>>>

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scan.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[N];
        for(int i=0;i<N;++i){
            arr[i] = scan.nextInt();
        }
