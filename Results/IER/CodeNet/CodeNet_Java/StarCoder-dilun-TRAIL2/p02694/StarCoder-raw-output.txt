he variable x is initialized with 103.
The variable a is initialized with 100.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the value of variable a is greater than or equal to the value of variable x.
If it is, the loop breaks and the value of variable count is printed as output.
If it is not, the value of variable a is incremented by 200 and the value of variable count is incremented by 1.
The loop repeats until the value of variable a is greater than or equal to the value of variable x.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner stdIn=new Scanner(System.in);

        int n=stdIn.nextInt();
        int count=0;

        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            if(n%i==0){
                count++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
        
    }

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
The for loop is entered and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable n is divisible by i.
If it is, the value of variable count is incremented by 1.
The loop repeats until the value of variable i is greater than the value of variable n.
The value of variable count is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
