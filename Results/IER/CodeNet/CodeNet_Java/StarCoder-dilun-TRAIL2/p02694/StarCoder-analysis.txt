he variable x is initialized with 103.
The variable a is initialized with 100.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the value of variable a is greater than or equal to the value of variable x.
If it is, the loop breaks and the value of variable count is printed as output.
If it is not, the value of variable a is incremented by 200 and the value of variable count is incremented by 1.
The loop repeats until the value of variable a is greater than or equal to the value of variable x.
