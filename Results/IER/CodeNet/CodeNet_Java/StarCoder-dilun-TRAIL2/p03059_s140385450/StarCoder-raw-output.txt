e variable x, y and z are initialized with 3, 5 and 7 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to 7 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int x=0,y=0, z=0;
      int sum = 0;
      try {
         Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
         x = scanner.nextInt();
         y = scanner.nextInt();
         z = scanner.nextInt();
         scanner.close();
      } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
         System.out.println("error");
      }
      for (int i=x; i<z+1; i=i+x) {
         sum = sum+y;
      }
      System.out.println(sum);
   }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 7
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
