e variable x, y and z are initialized with 3, 5 and 7 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to 7 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 10.
