he variable input is initialized with the input string "BBBWW".
The variable input_char is initialized with the character array of the input string.
The variable current_char is initialized with the first character of the input string.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the input string to check each character in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable current_char.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is not equal to the variable current_char. If it is not, it adds 1 to variable count and updates the variable current_char with the current character.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scan.nextLine();
        
        char[] input_char = input.toCharArray();
        
        char current_char = input_char[0];
        int count = 0;
        for (int i=1;i<input_char.length;i++) {
            if (input_char[i]!=current_char) {
                count++;
                current_char = input_char[i];
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```BBBWW
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
