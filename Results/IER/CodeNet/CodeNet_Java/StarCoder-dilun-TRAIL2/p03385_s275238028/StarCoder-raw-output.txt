he variable A is initialized with the input.
It checks if the variable A contains the characters a, b and c. If it does, it prints "Yes" as output.
If it does not, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      String A = sc.next();
      if(A.contains("a")&&A.contains("c")&&A.contains("b")){
      System.out.println("Yes");
      }
      else {
      System.out.println("No");
      }
   }
 }
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abc
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
