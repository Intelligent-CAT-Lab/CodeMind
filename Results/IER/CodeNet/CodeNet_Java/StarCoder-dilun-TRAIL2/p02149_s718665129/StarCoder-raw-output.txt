he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1000, 900 and 850 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is less than b. If it is, it checks if b is less than c. If it is, it prints C. If it is not, it prints B.
If a is not less than b, it checks if a is less than c. If it is, it prints C. If it is not, it prints A.
<<<Output>>>
C

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	int a = sc.nextInt();
	int b = sc.nextInt();
	int c = sc.nextInt();
	if(a<b){
	    if(b<c) System.out.println("C");
	    else System.out.println("B");
	}else if(a<c) System.out.println("C");
	else System.out.println("A");
    }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000 900 850
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1000, 900 and 850 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is less than b. If it is, it checks if b is less than c. If it is, it prints C. If it is not, it prints B.
If a is not less than b, it checks if a is less than c. If it is, it prints C. If it is not, it prints A.
