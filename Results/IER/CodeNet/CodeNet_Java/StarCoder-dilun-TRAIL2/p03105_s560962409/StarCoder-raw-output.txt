he variable A is initialized with 2, variable B is initialized with 11 and variable C is initialized with 4.
The if statement checks if B/A is greater than or equal to C. If it is, it prints the value of C.
If it is not, it checks if B/A is less than C. If it is, it prints the value of B/A.
If it is not, it prints the value of C.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String arg[]) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int A = sc.nextInt();
		int B = sc.nextInt();
		int C = sc.nextInt();
		
		if(B/A >= C) {
			System.out.print(C);
		} else if(B/A < C) {
			System.out.print(B/A);
		}

	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 11 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
