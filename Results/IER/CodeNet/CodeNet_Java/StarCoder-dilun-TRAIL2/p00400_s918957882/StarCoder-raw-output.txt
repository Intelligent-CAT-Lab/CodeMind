he variable c is initialized with 67.
It checks if c is in the range [65, 90]. If it is, it assigns 1 to variable code.
It checks if c is in the range [97, 122]. If it is, it assigns 2 to variable code.
It checks if c is not in the range [65, 90] and not in the range [97, 122]. If it is, it assigns 0 to variable code.
After the if-else statements, it prints the final value of variable code as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int n,sum=0;

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		n=sc.nextInt();

		for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
			sum=sum+i;
		System.out.println(sum);

	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable sum as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
