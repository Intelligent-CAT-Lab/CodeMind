he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 5, 14 and 80 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 5 to 14 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger a is divisible by variable c. If it is, it adds 1 to variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[]args)throws IOException{
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        String[] str = br.readLine().split(" ");
        int a = Integer.parseInt(str[0]);
        int b = Integer.parseInt(str[1]);
        int c = Integer.parseInt(str[2]);
        int count = 0;

        for(; a <= b; a++){
            if( c % a == 0 )count++;
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 14 80
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
