e variable word is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string word minus 1. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of the string word is equal to the character at index j+1 of the string word. If it is, it sets the value of variable flag to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable flag is true. If it is, it prints "Bad" as output. Otherwise, it prints "Good" as output.
