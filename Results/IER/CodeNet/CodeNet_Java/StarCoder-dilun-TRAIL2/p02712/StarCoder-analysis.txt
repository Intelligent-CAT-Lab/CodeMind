he variable S is initialized with 15.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is divisible by 3 or 5. If it is, it does nothing. If it is not, it adds the current interger i to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 12.
