he variable N is initialized with 3 and variable K is initialized with 2.
The value of variable ans is calculated by taking the cube root of N/K.
If K is even and N is less than K/2, then ans is incremented by the cube root of N/K.
If K is even and N is greater than or equal to K/2, then ans is incremented by the cube root of N/K+1.
