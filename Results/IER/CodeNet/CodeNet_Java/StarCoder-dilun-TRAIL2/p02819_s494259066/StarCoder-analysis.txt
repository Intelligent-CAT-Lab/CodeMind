he variable X is initialized with 20.
It checks if X is equal to 2. If it is, it prints 2 and returns.
If X is not equal to 2, it checks if X is even. If it is, it increments X by 1.
It enters a while loop and it checks if X is a prime number. If it is not, it increments X by 2 and checks again.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable X as output, which is 23.
