he variable X is initialized with 20.
It checks if X is equal to 2. If it is, it prints 2 and returns.
If X is not equal to 2, it checks if X is even. If it is, it increments X by 1.
It enters a while loop and it checks if X is a prime number. If it is not, it increments X by 2 and checks again.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable X as output, which is 23.
<<<Output>>>
23

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{

    public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception{
        Main main = new Main();
    }

    public Main(){
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int X;
        X = scanner.nextInt();

        if(X==2){
            System.out.println("2");
            return;
        }
        if( (X&1) == 0 ) X++;

        while(!check(X)) X+=2;

        System.out.println(X);
    }

    boolean check(int X){
        int n = 3;
        while(n*n <= X){
            if(X%n==0) return false;
            n+=2;
        }
        return true;
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 20.
It checks if X is equal to 2. If it is, it prints 2 and returns.
If X is not equal to 2, it checks if X is even. If it is, it increments X by 1.
It enters a while loop and it checks if X is a prime number. If it is not, it increments X by 2 and checks again.
