variable w is initialized with 25.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable w is not 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the remainder of the division of variable w by 3.
If the remainder is 0, it adds "0" to the variable base3.
If the remainder is 1, it adds "+" to the variable base3.
If the remainder is 2, it adds "-" to the variable base3.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable base3 as output, which is "+-0".
<<<Output>>>
+-0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

import static java.lang.Integer.parseInt;

/**
 * Symmetric Ternary Number
 */
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String line;
		String[] words;

		while ((line = br.readLine())!= null &&!line.isEmpty()) {

			int w = parseInt(line);
			String base3 = "";

			while (w!= 0) {
				int r = w % 3;
				if (r == 0) {
					base3 = "0" + base3;
					w /= 3;
				} else if (r == 1) {
					base3 = "+" + base3;
					w /= 3;
				} else if (r == 2) {
					base3 = "-" + base3;
					w /= 3;
					w++;
				}
			}

			System.out.println(base3);

		} // end while
	} // end main
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable w is initialized with 12.
It enters a while loop
