he variable a and variable b are initialized with 5 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable op is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable op.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is even or odd. If it is even, it adds the current interger a to variable b. If it is odd, it adds the current interger b to variable a.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable a and variable b as output, which is 10 and 2.
<<<Output>>>
10
2
