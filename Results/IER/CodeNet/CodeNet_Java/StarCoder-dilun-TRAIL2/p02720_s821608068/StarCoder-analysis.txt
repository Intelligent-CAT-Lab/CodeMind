he variable K is initialized with 15.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the size of the priority queue queue is less than K.
Inside the while loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9 to check each integer i in this range.
It adds the current interger i to the priority queue queue and it adds the current interger i to the hash set set.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from -1 to 1 to check each integer j in this range.
It checks if the value of variable t plus j is less than 0. If it is, it skips the current iteration.
Then it checks if the value of variable t plus j is greater than 9. If it is, it skips the current iteration.
Then it converts the string s to an array of characters d.
Then it converts the last character of the string s to an integer t.
Then it converts the integer t plus j to a string and appends it to the string s.
Then it converts the string s to a long integer n.
Then it checks if the hash set set contains the current long integer n. If it does, it skips the current iteration.
Then it checks if the hash set new_set contains the current long integer n. If it does, it skips the current iteration.
Then it adds the current long integer n to the hash set new_set.
Then it adds the current long integer n to the priority queue queue.
After the while loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to K - 1 to check each integer i in this range.
It removes the first element of the priority queue queue.
Then it prints the first element of the priority queue queue as output.
