he variable string is initialized with the input string "1222".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string. The value of variable i is also passed to variable char.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character char is equal to '2'. If it is, it increments the value of variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{



	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);			//文字の入力
		String string = sc.next();
		int count =0 ;
		for(int i = 0;i < string.length();i++){
			if(string.charAt(i) == '2'){
				count++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1222
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
