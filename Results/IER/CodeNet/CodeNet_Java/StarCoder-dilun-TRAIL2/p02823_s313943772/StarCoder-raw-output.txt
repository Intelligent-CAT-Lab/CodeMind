he variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if A is equal to B. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
If the condition is not met, it checks if the difference between B and A is even. If it is, it prints the quotient of the difference between B and A divided by 2 as output.
If the condition is not met, it checks if the difference between A and 1 is less than the difference between N and B. If it is, it prints the quotient of the sum of A and B minus 1 divided by 2 as output.
If the condition is not met, it prints the quotient of the sum of N times 2 minus A and B plus 1 divided by 2 as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long N = sc.nextLong();
        long A = sc.nextLong();
        long B = sc.nextLong();

        if(A==B){
            System.out.println(0);
        }else if((B-A)%2 ==0){

            System.out.println((B-A)/2);

        }else{

            if((A-1)<(N-B)){
                System.out.println((A+B-1)/2);
            }else{
                System.out.println((N*2-A-B+1)/2);
            }
        }



            }

        }

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
