he variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if A is equal to B. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
If the condition is not met, it checks if the difference between B and A is even. If it is, it prints the quotient of the difference between B and A divided by 2 as output.
If the condition is not met, it checks if the difference between A and 1 is less than the difference between N and B. If it is, it prints the quotient of the sum of A and B minus 1 divided by 2 as output.
If the condition is not met, it prints the quotient of the sum of N times 2 minus A and B plus 1 divided by 2 as output.
