he variable s is initialized with the input string "internationalization".
The variable word is initialized with an array of length s.length() which is 18.
The variable len is initialized with the length of s minus 2 which is 16.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to s.length() to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable word.
Inside the for loop, it assigns the character at index i of variable s to the corresponding index i of variable word.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable word as output, which is "i16n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n10n1
