he variable stack is initialized with a new instance of class Stack.
The variable scanner is initialized with a new instance of class Scanner.
The variable line is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates over each token in the input line. The tokens are separated by spaces.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the token is "+", "-", "*" or a number.
If the token is "+", it pops the top two elements from the stack and adds them together. The result is pushed back to the stack.
If the token is "-", it pops the top two elements from the stack and subtracts the first element from the second element. The result is pushed back to the stack.
If the token is "*", it pops the top two elements from the stack and multiplies them together. The result is pushed back to the stack.
If the token is a number, it pushes the number to the stack.
After the loop finishes, it pops the top element from the stack and prints it as output.
