e variable first is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer a in this range. The value of variable a is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer b in this range. The value of variable b is also passed to variable c.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer c in this range. The value of variable c is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the third for loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor of a, b and c by calling the gcd function.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
