e variable first is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer a in this range. The value of variable a is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer b in this range. The value of variable b is also passed to variable c.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer c in this range. The value of variable c is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the third for loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor of a, b and c by calling the gcd function.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int first = sc.nextInt();
		int sum = 0;
		//ユークリッドの互除法
		for(int a =1; a<=first ; a++) { //(a,b,c)のAが増える
			for(int b = 1; b<=first; b++) { //(a,b,c)のBが増える
				for(int c = 1; c<=first; c++) { //(a,b,c)のCが増える
					sum += gcd(gcd(a,b),c);
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}

	private static int gcd(int a, int b) {
		if(b==0) {
			return a;
		}
		a = a%b;
		//割られた数に余りを入れる。a=390,b=273の場合
		//a=117(あまりの数),b=273   割られた側が上書きされるイメージ
