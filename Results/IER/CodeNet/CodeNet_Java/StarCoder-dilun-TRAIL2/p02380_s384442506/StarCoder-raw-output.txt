he variable a, variable b and variable angle are initialized with 4, 3 and 90 respectively according to the input.
The variable rad is initialized with the value of angle in radians.
The value of angle is 90, so the if condition is met.
The value of area is calculated by dividing the area of the triangle by 2.
The value of circum is calculated by adding the length of the three sides of the triangle.
The value of hight is calculated by multiplying the length of the base by sin(rad).

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.io.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)throws IOException{ 
    	InputStreamReader in = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
        BufferedReader read = new BufferedReader(in);

        String line = read.readLine();
        String [] spli = line.split(" ");
        double a = Double.parseDouble(spli[0]);
        double b = Double.parseDouble(spli[1]);
        double angle = Double.parseDouble(spli[2]);
        double rad = Math.toRadians(angle);    
        double area = 0;
        double circum = 0;
        double hight = 0;
        
        if(angle == 90){
        	area = a*b/2;
        	circum = Math.sqrt(a*a+b*b)+a+b;
        	hight = b;
        }
        else{
        	area = a*b*Math.sin(rad)/2;
            circum = a+b+Math.sqrt(a*a+b*b-2*a*b*Math.cos(rad));
            hight = b*Math.sin(rad);         
        }
        System.out.println(area);
        System.out.println(circum);
        System.out.println(hight);         
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 3 60
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
