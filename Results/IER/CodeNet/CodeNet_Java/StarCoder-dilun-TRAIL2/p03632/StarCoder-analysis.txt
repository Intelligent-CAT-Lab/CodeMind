riable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 0, 75, 25 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 75 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable start.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the difference between the current interger i and variable c.
Then it checks if the calculated variable start is greater than variable end. If it is, it sets the value of variable start to variable end.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable start as output, which is 50.
