riable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 0, 75, 25 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 75 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable start.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the difference between the current interger i and variable c.
Then it checks if the calculated variable start is greater than variable end. If it is, it sets the value of variable start to variable end.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable start as output, which is 50.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            reader.lines()
               .map(line -> Arrays.stream(line.split(" "))
                       .mapToInt(Integer::parseInt)
                       .toArray())
               .forEach(in -> {
                    int a = in[0];
                    int b = in[1];
                    int c = in[2];
                    int d = in[3];
                    
                    int start = Math.max(a,c);
                    int end = Math.min(b,d);
                    System.out.println( (end-start)>0? end-start : 0 );
                });
        }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 75 25 100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
