he variable a is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable a. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it extracts a substring from variable a from index i to index j.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from j to the length of variable a. The value of variable k is also passed to variable l.
Inside the second for loop, it extracts a substring from variable a from index k to index l.
Then it checks if the extracted substrings are equal to "keyence". If it is, it sets variable bool to true.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable bool as output, which is true.
