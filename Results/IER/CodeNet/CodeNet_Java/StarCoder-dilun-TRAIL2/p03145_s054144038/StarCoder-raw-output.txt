he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 3, 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the area of the triangle by dividing the product of the variables a and b by 2.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of the variable as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//変数定義
		int a,b,c;

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		a = sc.nextInt();
		b = sc.nextInt();
		c = sc.nextInt();

		System.out.println(a*b*c);

	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
