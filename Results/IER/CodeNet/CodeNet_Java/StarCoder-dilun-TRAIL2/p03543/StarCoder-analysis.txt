he variable n is initialized with 1118 according to the input.
It calculates the last digit of variable n by dividing it by 10. The remainder is stored in variable n1.
It calculates the last two digits of variable n by dividing it by 100. The remainder is stored in variable n10.
It calculates the last three digits of variable n by dividing it by 1000. The remainder is stored in variable n100.
It calculates the first digit of variable n by dividing it by 1000. The remainder is stored in variable n1000.
Then it checks if the last digit of variable n is equal to the last two digits of variable n, and if the last two digits of variable n are equal to the last three digits of variable n.
If the condition is met, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
