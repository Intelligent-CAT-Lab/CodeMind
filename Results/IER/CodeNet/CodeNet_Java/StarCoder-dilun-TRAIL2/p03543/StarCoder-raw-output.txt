he variable n is initialized with 1118 according to the input.
It calculates the last digit of variable n by dividing it by 10. The remainder is stored in variable n1.
It calculates the last two digits of variable n by dividing it by 100. The remainder is stored in variable n10.
It calculates the last three digits of variable n by dividing it by 1000. The remainder is stored in variable n100.
It calculates the first digit of variable n by dividing it by 1000. The remainder is stored in variable n1000.
Then it checks if the last digit of variable n is equal to the last two digits of variable n, and if the last two digits of variable n are equal to the last three digits of variable n.
If the condition is met, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int n = sc.nextInt();

		int n1 = n % 10;
		int n10 = (n - n1) % 100/10;
		int n100 = (n - n1 - n10 * 10) % 1000/100;
		int n1000 = n / 1000;

		if ((n1 == n10 && n1 == n100)
				|| (n10 == n100 && n10 == n1000)) {
			System.out.println("Yes");
		} else {
			System.out.println("No");
		}

	}

}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1118
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with
