he variable X is initialized with the input string "CODEFESTIVAL".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string X. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is 4. If it is, it appends a space and the character at the current index i to the string builder sb.
Otherwise, it appends the character at the current index i to the string builder sb.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of string builder sb as output, which is "CODE FESTIVAL".
<<<Output>>>
CODE FESTIVAL

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        PrintWriter pr = new PrintWriter(System.out);
        String X = br.readLine();
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<X.length();i++){
            if(X.charAt(i)=='a'){
                count++;
            }
        }
        pr.println(count);
        pr.close();
        
    }
    
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```CODEFESTIVAL
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with the input string "CODEFESTIVAL".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string X. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at the current index i is 'a'. If it is, it increments the value of variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
