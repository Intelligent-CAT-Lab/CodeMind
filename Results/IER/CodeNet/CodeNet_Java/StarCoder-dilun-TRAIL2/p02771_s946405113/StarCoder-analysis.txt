variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 5, 7 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a, b and c are equal. If they are, it sets the value of variable flag to true.
Then it checks if b, c and a are equal. If they are, it sets the value of variable flag to true.
Then it checks if c, a and b are equal. If they are, it sets the value of variable flag to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if variable flag is true. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
