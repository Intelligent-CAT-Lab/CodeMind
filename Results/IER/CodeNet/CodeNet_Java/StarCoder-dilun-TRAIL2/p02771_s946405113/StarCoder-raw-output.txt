variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 5, 7 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a, b and c are equal. If they are, it sets the value of variable flag to true.
Then it checks if b, c and a are equal. If they are, it sets the value of variable flag to true.
Then it checks if c, a and b are equal. If they are, it sets the value of variable flag to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if variable flag is true. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();

		if (a == b && b == c) {
			System.out.println("Equilateral");
		} else if (a == b || b == c || a == c) {
			System.out.println("Isosceles");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Scalene");
		}

	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 5 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 5, 5 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a, b and c are equal. If they are, it prints "Equilateral" as output.
Then it checks if b, c and a are equal. If they are, it prints "Isosceles" as output.
Then it checks if c, a and b are equal. If they are, it prints "Scalene" as output.
After the loop finishes, it checks if variable flag is true. If it is, it prints "Yes
