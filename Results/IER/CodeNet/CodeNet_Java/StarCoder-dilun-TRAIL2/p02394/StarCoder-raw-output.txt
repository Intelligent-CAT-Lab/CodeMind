he variable work is initialized with 5 elements. The first element is assigned with the value of W, the second element is assigned with the value of H, the third element is assigned with the value of x, the fourth element is assigned with the value of y, and the fifth element is assigned with the value of r.
The value of W is 5, the value of H is 4, the value of x is 2, the value of y is 2, and the value of r is 1.
The value of x-r is 1, the value of x+r is 3, the value of y-r is 1, and the value of y+r is 3.
The value of x-r is greater than or equal to 0, the value of x+r is less than or equal to W, the value of y-r is greater than or equal to 0, and the value of y+r is less than or equal to H.
The value of judge is assigned with the value of "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		//入力
		BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String work[]=new String[5];
		try {
			work=br.readLine().split("\\s+");
		}catch(Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		
		int W=Integer.parseInt(work[0]);
		int H=Integer.parseInt(work[1]);
		int x=Integer.parseInt(work[2]);
		int y=Integer.parseInt(work[3]);
		int r=Integer.parseInt(work[4]);
		
		//判定処理
		String judge;
		if((x-r)>=0 && (x+r)<=W){
			if(((y-r)>=0 && (y+r)<=H)) {
