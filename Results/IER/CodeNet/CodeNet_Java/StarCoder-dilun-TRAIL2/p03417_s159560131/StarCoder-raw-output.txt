he variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the absolute value of the difference of the product of (n-2) and (m-2) as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long n = sc.nextLong();
        long m = sc.nextLong();
        sc.close();

        System.out.println(Math.abs((n-2) * (m-2)));
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
