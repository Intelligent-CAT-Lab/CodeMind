he variable x is initialized with 5, variable a is initialized with 2 and variable b is initialized with 7.
The code first calculates the absolute value of the difference between x and a and the difference between x and b.
Then it checks if the absolute value of the difference between x and a is less than the absolute value of the difference between x and b.
If it is, it prints A as output. Otherwise, it prints B as output.
<<<Output>>>
A

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = sc.nextInt();
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        if (Math.abs(x-a) < Math.abs(x-b)) {
            System.out.println("A");
        } else {
            System.out.println("B");
        }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 7
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
