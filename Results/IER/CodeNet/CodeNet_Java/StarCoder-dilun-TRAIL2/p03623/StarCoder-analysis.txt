he variable x is initialized with 5, variable a is initialized with 2 and variable b is initialized with 7.
The code first calculates the absolute value of the difference between x and a and the difference between x and b.
Then it checks if the absolute value of the difference between x and a is less than the absolute value of the difference between x and b.
If it is, it prints A as output. Otherwise, it prints B as output.
