he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable p is initialized with 24.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to p-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable t.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the power of the current interger i to the power of variable n.
Then it checks if the calculated variable t is divisible by variable p. If it is, it updates the value of variable ans to i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long n = sc.nextLong();
        long p = sc.nextLong();
        sc.close();
        if(n == 1){
            System.out.println(p);
            return;
        }

        long ans = 1;
        for(int i = 2; i < p ; i++){
            //if(p % i == 0){
                long t = (long)Math.pow(i,n);
                if(p % t == 0){
                    ans = i;
                }
                if(t > p){
                    break;
                }                
            //}
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 24
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 and variable p is initialized with 24.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to p-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable t.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the power of the current interger i to the power of variable n.
Then it checks if the calculated variable t is divisible by variable p. If it is, it updates the value of variable ans to
