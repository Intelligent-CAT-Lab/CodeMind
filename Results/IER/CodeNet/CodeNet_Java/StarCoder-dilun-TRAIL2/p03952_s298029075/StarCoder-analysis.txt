variable N is initialized with 4 and variable X is initialized with 4.
The variable LEN is initialized with 2*N-1.
It enters a if statement to check if N is equal to 2.
Inside the if statement, it enters a if statement to check if X is equal to 2.
Inside the if statement, it returns an array of length 3 with values 1, 2 and 3.
Then it enters a else statement to check if X is less than or equal to 2*N-2 and greater than or equal to 2.
Inside the else statement, it enters a if statement to check if X is equal to 2.
Inside the if statement, it returns an array of length 4 with values 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Then it enters a else statement to check if X is less than or equal to 2*N-2 and greater than or equal to 2.
Inside the else statement, it returns null.
After the if statement finishes, it checks if the returned value is null.
If it is not null, it prints "Yes" and then it prints the returned value.
