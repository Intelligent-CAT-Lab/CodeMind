he variable lines is initialized with the input. Then it is converted to an array of integers and stored in variable arr.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates over the array arr to convert each string in the array to an integer and store it in the same array.
Then it sorts the array arr in ascending order.
Then it checks if the difference between the third element of the array arr and the second element is greater than 3. If it is, it enters a while loop and it increments the second element of the array arr by 2 until the difference between the third element and the second element is less than or equal to 3.
Then it checks if the difference between the second element of the array arr and the first element is greater than 3. If it is, it enters a while loop and it increments the first element of the array arr by 2 until the difference between the second element and the first element is less than or equal to 3.
Then it creates a tuple object with the first element of the array arr, the second element of the array arr and the third element of the array arr.
Then it sets the step variable of the tuple object to 0.
Then it enters a while loop and it checks if the tuple object is equal to the target tuple. If it is, it prints the step variable of the tuple object as output.
Then it enters a while loop and it checks if the queue is empty. If it is not, it pops the first element of the queue and stores it in variable cur.
Then it enters a if statement and it checks if the first element of the array cur is less than the second element of the array cur and the first element is less than the third element of the array cur. If it is, it enters a while loop and it increments the first element of the array cur by 2 until the first element is greater than or equal to the second element and the first element is greater than or equal to the third element.
Then it enters a if statement and it checks if the second element of the array cur is less than the third element of the array cur. If it is, it enters a while loop and it increments the second element of the array cur by 2 until the second element is greater than or equal to the third element.
Then it enters a if statement and it checks if the first element of the array cur
