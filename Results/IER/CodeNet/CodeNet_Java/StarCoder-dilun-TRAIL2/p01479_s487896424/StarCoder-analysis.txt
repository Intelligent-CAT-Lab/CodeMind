he variable c is initialized with the input string.
It enters a while loop and it iterates over the characters of the string c.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current character is 'e'. If it is, it adds the string "e" to the arraylist AL.
Then it checks if the current character is 'c'. If it is, it adds the string "c" to the arraylist AL.
Then it checks if the current character is 'e'. If it is, it adds the string "e" to the arraylist AL.
Then it checks if the current character is 'c'. If it is, it adds the string "c" to the arraylist AL.
Then it checks if the current character is 'e'. If it is, it adds the string "e" to the arraylist AL.
