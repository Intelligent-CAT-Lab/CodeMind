e variable L is initialized with 2020 and variable R is initialized with 2040.
The value of variable R is subtracted from variable L and the result is stored in variable R.
The value of variable L is modulus 2019 and the result is stored in variable L.
The value of variable R is added to variable L and the result is stored in variable R.
The for loop iterates from variable L to variable R.
Inside the for loop, the for loop iterates from variable L to variable i.
Inside the for loop, the for loop iterates from variable L to variable j.
The value of variable res is initialized with 2019.
The value of variable res is compared with the value of (i*j) modulus 2019.
If the value of (i*j) modulus 2019 is less than the value of variable res, then the value of variable res is updated with the value of (i*j) modulus 2019.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 1000.
