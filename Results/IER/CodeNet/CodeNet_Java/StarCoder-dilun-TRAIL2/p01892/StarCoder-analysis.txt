variable A, variable B and variable N are initialized with 19, 30 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i * B % j is equal to 0. If it is, it calculates the absolute value of A - i * B / j and stores it in variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
