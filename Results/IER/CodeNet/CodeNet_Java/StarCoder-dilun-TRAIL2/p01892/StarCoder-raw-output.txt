 variable A, variable B and variable N are initialized with 19, 30 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i * B % j is equal to 0. If it is, it calculates the absolute value of A - i * B / j and stores it in variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
		}
		int[] dp = new int[n];
		dp[0] = arr[0];
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1] + arr[i], arr[i]);
		}
		System.out.println(dp[n - 1]);
	}

}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also
