e variable s is initialized with the input string "pdbq".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s divided by 2. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'b', 'd', 'p' or 'q'. If it is, it assigns the corresponding character to variable d.
If the current character c is 'b', it assigns 'd' to variable d. If the current character c is 'd', it assigns 'b' to variable d. If the current character c is 'p', it assigns 'q' to variable d. If the current character c is 'q', it assigns 'p' to variable d.
Then it checks if the current character d is equal to the character at the index l minus 1 minus i. If it is not, it prints "No" as output and returns.
If the current character d is equal to the character at the index l minus 1 minus i, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
