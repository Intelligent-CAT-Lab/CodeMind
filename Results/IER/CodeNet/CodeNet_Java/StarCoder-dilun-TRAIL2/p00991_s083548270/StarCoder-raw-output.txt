he variable r, c, a1, a2, b1 and b2 are initialized with 4, 4, 0, 0, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable b1_ and variable b2_ are initialized with the absolute value of b1 - a1 and b2 - a2 respectively.
The variable pow is initialized with 1.
It checks if b1_ == r - b1_ and b2_ == c - b2_. If it is true, it multiplies pow by 2.
It then calculates the minimum of b1_ and r - b1_ and the minimum of b2_ and c - b2_ and assigns it to b1_ and b2_ respectively.
It then enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to r - 1 and from 0 to c - 1 to calculate the value of dp[i][j] for each i and j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i == 0 and j == 0. If it is true, it assigns 1 to dp[i][j].
Else if i == 0, it assigns dp[i][j-1] to dp[i][j].
Else if j == 0, it assigns dp[i-1][j] to dp[i][j].
Else, it assigns (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]) % 100000007 to dp[i][j].
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of dp[b1_][b2_] * pow as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
