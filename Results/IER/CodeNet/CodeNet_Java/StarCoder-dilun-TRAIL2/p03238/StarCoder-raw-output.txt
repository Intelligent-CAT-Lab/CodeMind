he variable n is initialized with 1.
The if statement is true and it prints "Hello World" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Hello World
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner fs = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = fs.nextInt();
		if(n == 1)System.out.println("Hello World");
		else {
			int a = fs.nextInt(),b = fs.nextInt();
			System.out.println(a+b);
		}
		fs.close();
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
1 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2.
The if statement is false and it enters the else statement.
The variable a is initialized with 1 and variable b is initialized with 2.
The value of variable a is added to variable b and it prints 3 as output.
<<<Output>>>
3
