he variable N is initialized with 1 and variable M is initialized with 6.
The if statement checks if N*2 is greater than or equal to M. If it is, then the value of variable res is set to M/2.
Otherwise, the value of variable res is set to N+((M-2*N)/4).
After the if statement, it prints the value of variable res as output, which is 2.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int M = sc.nextInt();

        int res = 0;
        
        if(N*2>=M){
            res = M/2;
        }else{
            res = N+((M-2*N)/4);
        }

        
        System.out.println(res);
        
        }
    }
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
