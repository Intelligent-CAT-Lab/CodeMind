he variable N is initialized with 1 and variable M is initialized with 6.
The if statement checks if N*2 is greater than or equal to M. If it is, then the value of variable res is set to M/2.
Otherwise, the value of variable res is set to N+((M-2*N)/4).
After the if statement, it prints the value of variable res as output, which is 2.
