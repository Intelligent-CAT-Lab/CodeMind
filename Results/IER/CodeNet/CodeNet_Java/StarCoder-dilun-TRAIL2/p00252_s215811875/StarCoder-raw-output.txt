he code first checks if the input is either "1 1 0" or "0 0 1". If it is, it returns "Open". Otherwise, it returns "Close".
The code then enters a while loop and it keeps reading input from the standard input until the end of file is reached.
Inside the while loop, it calls the method solve() with the current input as the argument. The method returns either "Open" or "Close".
The code then prints the output of the method solve() as the output of the while loop.
<<<Output>>>
Close

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Main();
	}

	public Main() {
		new AOJ0258().doIt();
	}
	
	class AOJ0258{
		
		String solve(String input){
			if(input.equals("1 1 0")||input.equals("0 0 1"))return "Open";
			return "Close";
		}
		
		void doIt(){
			while(in.hasNext())System.out.println(solve(in.nextLine()));
		}
	}
	
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
