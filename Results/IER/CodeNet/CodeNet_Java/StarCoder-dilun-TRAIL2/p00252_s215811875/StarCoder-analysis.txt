he code first checks if the input is either "1 1 0" or "0 0 1". If it is, it returns "Open". Otherwise, it returns "Close".
The code then enters a while loop and it keeps reading input from the standard input until the end of file is reached.
Inside the while loop, it calls the method solve() with the current input as the argument. The method returns either "Open" or "Close".
The code then prints the output of the method solve() as the output of the while loop.
