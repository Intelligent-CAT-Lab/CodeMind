he variable tap is initialized with 1. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable tap is less than the value of variable b.
Inside the while loop, it increments the value of variable tap by the value of variable a minus 1.
Then it increments the value of variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
