e variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than 1. If it is, it prints 0 and returns.
Then it checks if n is equal to m. If it is, it calculates the value of variable answer by calling the method solve(n,m) twice.
Then it adds the value of variable answer twice to itself.
Then it calculates the modulo of variable answer by 1000000007.
Then it prints the final value of variable answer as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int m = sc.nextInt();
        if(Math.abs(n-m) > 1){
            System.out.println(0);
            return;
        }
        long answer = 0;
        if(n == m){
            answer = solve(n,m);
            answer += solve(n,m);
        }
        else if(n > m){
            answer = solve(n,m);
        }
        else if(m > n){
            answer = solve(m,n);
        }
        answer %= 1000000007;
        System.out.println(answer);
    }
    public static long solve(int max,int x){
        long answer = 1;
        while(max!= 1){
            //System.out.println("max = "+ max);
            answer *= max;
            answer %= 1000000007;
            answer *= x;
            answer %= 1000000007;
            max--;
            x--;
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
