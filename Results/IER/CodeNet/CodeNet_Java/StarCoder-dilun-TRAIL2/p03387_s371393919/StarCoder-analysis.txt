variable array is initialized with 3 elements. The first element is initialized with 2, the second element is initialized with 5 and the third element is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to array[i].
Inside the for loop, it sorts the array in ascending order.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to array[i].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the difference between the third element of the array and the current interger i.
Then it checks if the following conditions are met:
1. array[0] + array[1] == 0
2. array[0]!= array[1] && array[1]!= array[2]
3. array[0] == array[1]
4. array[1] == array[2]
If the condition is met, it adds the current interger i to variable answer.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 1.
