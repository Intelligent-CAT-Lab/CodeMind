e variable a and variable b are initialized with H and H respectively according to the input.
It checks if the values of variables a and b are equal. If they are, it prints H as output. Otherwise, it prints D as output.
<<<Output>>>
H

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args)  {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();

		if (a > b && a > c) {
			System.out.println(a);
		} else if (b > a && b > c) {
			System.out.println(b);
		} else {
			System.out.println(c);
		}
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the values of variables a, b and c are in ascending order. If they are, it prints the largest value as output.
<<<Output>>>
