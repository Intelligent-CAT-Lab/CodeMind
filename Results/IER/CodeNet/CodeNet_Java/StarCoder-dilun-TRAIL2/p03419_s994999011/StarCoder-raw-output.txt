he variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable bin is initialized with the value of n-2.
The variable bim is initialized with the value of m-2.
The variable ret is initialized with the absolute value of the product of bin and bim.
The final value of ret is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Main m = new Main();
		m.run();
	}

	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	void run() {
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();
		
		int ret = 0;
		
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
				ret += 1;
			}
		}
		
		System.out.println(ret);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable ret is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to m-1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it adds 1 to variable ret.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ret as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
