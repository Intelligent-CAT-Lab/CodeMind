variable cs is initialized with a list of size 1 and the first element is 'X'.
The variable ls is initialized with a list of size 1 and the first element is 1.
The variable last is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it reads a line from the input.
Inside the while loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the line.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the first element of the list cs is equal to the current character of the line.
If it is, it adds 1 to the value of the first element of the list ls.
If it is not, it adds the current character of the line to the list cs and it adds 1 to the list ls.
It also adds 1 to the variable last.
After the for loop finishes, it adds 'X' to the list cs and it adds 1 to the list ls.
It also adds 1 to the variable last.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the size of the list cs minus 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current element of the list cs is equal to 'O'.
If it is, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i-1 to i+1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current element of the list cs is equal to 'J' and the next element of the list cs is equal to 'I'.
If it is, it checks if the value of the current element of the list ls is greater than or equal to the value of the current element of the list ls.
If it is, it checks if the value of the next element of the list ls is greater than or equal to the value of the current element of the list ls.
If it is, it sets the value of the variable k to the maximum of the value of the current element of the list ls.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the value of the variable k as output.
