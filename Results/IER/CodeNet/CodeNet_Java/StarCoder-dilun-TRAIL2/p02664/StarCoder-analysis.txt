he variable c is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i is 'D' or '?' and if it is, it increments the variable count by 1.
Then it replaces the character at index i with 'D'.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of the string c as output.
