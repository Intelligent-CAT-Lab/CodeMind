he variable W, variable H and variable c are initialized with 3, 3 and B respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable k.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current interger i or j is 0 or 3. If it is, it appends '+' to the string builder sb.
If the current interger i or j is 1 or 2, it appends '-' to the string builder sb.
If the current interger i or j is 0 or 2, it appends '|' to the string builder sb.
If the current interger i is 1 and j is 1, it appends the character c to the string builder sb.
If none of the above conditions are met, it appends '.' to the string builder sb.
After the second for loop finishes, it appends a new line character to the string builder sb.
After the first for loop finishes, it prints the final string builder sb as output.
