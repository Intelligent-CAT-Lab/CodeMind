he variable S is initialized with the input string "BBW".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string S. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'W'. If it is, it checks if variable b is true. If it is, it adds the current interger i minus the value of variable count to variable ans. Then it adds 1 to variable count.
If the current character c is not 'W', it checks if the current character c is 'B'. If it is, it sets variable b to true.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[]args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    String S = sc.next();
    long ans = 0;
    long count = 0;
    boolean b = false;
    for(int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++){
      char c = S.charAt(i);
      if(c == 'W'){
        if(b){
          ans += i-count;
          count++;
        }else{
          count++;
        }
      }else if(c == 'B'){
        b = true;
      }
    }
    System.out.println(ans);
  }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```WWW
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input string "WWW".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string S. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'W'. If it is, it checks if variable b is true. If it is, it adds the current interger i minus the value of variable count to variable ans. Then it adds 1 to variable count.
