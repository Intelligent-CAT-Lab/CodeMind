he variable S is initialized with the input string "BBW".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string S. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'W'. If it is, it checks if variable b is true. If it is, it adds the current interger i minus the value of variable count to variable ans. Then it adds 1 to variable count.
If the current character c is not 'W', it checks if the current character c is 'B'. If it is, it sets variable b to true.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
