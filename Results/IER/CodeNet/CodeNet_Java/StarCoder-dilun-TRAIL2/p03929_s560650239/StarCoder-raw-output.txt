he variable n and variable k are initialized with 7 and 7 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 11 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable base.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger base by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [7, 7]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable cnt. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 and 11.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable base.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger base by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [7, 7]. If it does, it adds the current interger j to variable cnt. The condition is met when j is 1,2,3,4 and 5.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer x in this range. The value of variable x is also passed to variable base.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer y in this range. The value of variable y is also passed to variable base.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger base by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [7, 7]. If it does, it adds the current interger base to variable cnt. The condition is met when x is 0,1,2 and y is 0,1,2.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer x in this range
