he variable a is initialized with 8 and variable b is initialized with 13.
The difference between b and a is calculated by subtracting b from a.
The square of the difference is calculated by multiplying the difference by itself.
The difference between b and a is subtracted from the square of the difference.
The final output is the result of the subtraction.
