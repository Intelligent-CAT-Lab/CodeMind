he variable pnum is initialized with 7.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 31 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable result.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the power of 2 of the current interger i by repeatedlly multiplying it with itself.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 128.
<<<Output>>>
128

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedOutputStream;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static PrintWriter out;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main.run();
    }

    private static void run() {
        out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedOutputStream(System.out));
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        out.println(count(Integer.parseInt(sc.next())));
        out.close();
        sc.close();
    }

    private static int count(int pnum) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; (int) Math.pow(2, i) <= pnum; i++) {
            result = (int) Math.pow(2, i);
        }
        return result;
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable pnum is initialized with 12.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 31 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable result.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the power of 2 of the current interger i by repeatedlly multiplying it with itself.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 4096.
<<<Output>>>
