e variable c is initialized with 1111.
It checks if the first and last characters of the string c are 0 or 1. If they are, it prints -1 and returns.
Otherwise, it checks if the first half of the string c is equal to the second half of the string c. If it is, it prints 1 and 2 as the first and second line of output.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to the length of the string c. The value of variable i is also passed to variable s.
Inside the for loop, it prints the value of variable s and i as the first and second line of output.
If the second character of the string c is 1, it sets the value of variable s to i.
