he variable N, variable A, variable B, variable C and variable D are initialized with 5, 1, 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable max and variable min.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum value of the current interger i by calculating the difference of variable D multiplied by (N-1-i) and variable C multiplied by i.
It also calculates the minimum value of the current interger i by calculating the difference of variable C multiplied by (N-1-i) and variable D multiplied by i.
Then it checks if the calculated variable min and variable max fall within the range [1, 4]. If it does, it prints "YES" as output.
After the loop finishes, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Main().solve();
	}
	
	void solve(){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int N=sc.nextInt();
		int A=sc.nextInt();
		int B=sc.nextInt();
		int C=sc.nextInt();
		int D=sc.nextInt();
		
		for(int i=0;i<=N-1;i++){
			int max=D*(N-1-i)-C*i;
			int min=C*(N-1-i)-D*i;
			if(Math.abs(B-A)>=min && Math.abs(B-A)<=max){
				System.out.println("YES");
				return;
			}
		}
		System.out.println("NO");
	}

}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 5 2 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
