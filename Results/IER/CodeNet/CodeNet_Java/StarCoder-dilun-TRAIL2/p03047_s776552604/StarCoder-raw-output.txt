TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		int d = sc.nextInt();
		int e = sc.nextInt();
		int f = sc.nextInt();
		int g = sc.nextInt();
		int h = sc.nextInt();
		int i = sc.nextInt();
		int j = sc.nextInt();
		int sum = 0;
		sum = a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j;
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 12 and variable k is initialized with 2.
The code subtracts k from n and prints the result.
