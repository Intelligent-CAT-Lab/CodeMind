he variable n is initialized with 2 and variable x is initialized with 7.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable layer[i] by using the formula layer[i]=layer[i-1]*2+3.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans by using the formula ans=pati(n,x).
The function pati(n,x) calculates the number of ways to arrange n+1 non-adjacent numbers in a row such that the sum of the numbers is x.
The function pati(n,x) returns the number of ways to arrange n+1 non-adjacent numbers in a row such that the sum of the numbers is x.
The function pati(n,x) returns the number of ways to arrange n+1 non-adjacent numbers in a row such that the sum of the numbers is x.
