he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 6, 4 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of variable b and variable c is less than variable a. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
If it is not, it calculates the difference between the sum of variable b and variable c and variable a and prints it as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
          Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
          int a = sc.nextInt();
          int b = sc.nextInt();
          int c = sc.nextInt();
          if(b + c < a){
              System.out.println(0);
          } else {
            System.out.println(b + c - a);
          }
        }
    }
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 4 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
