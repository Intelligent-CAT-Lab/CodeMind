he variable a and variable b are initialized with 8 and 12 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 2.
The variable max is initialized with the smaller of the two variables a and b.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from max to 0 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if a is divisible by i and b is divisible by i. If it does, it increments the variable count by 1. If the variable count equals k, it sets the variable result to i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 4.
