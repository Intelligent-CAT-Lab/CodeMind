he variable a and variable b are initialized with 8 and 12 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 2.
The variable max is initialized with the smaller of the two variables a and b.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from max to 0 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if a is divisible by i and b is divisible by i. If it does, it increments the variable count by 1. If the variable count equals k, it sets the variable result to i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String args[]) {

        // 入力
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int b = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int k = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        sc.close();

        // 主処理
        int result = 0;
        int count = 0;
        int max = Math.min(a, b);
        for (int i = max; 0 < i; i--) {
            if (a % i == 0 && b % i == 0) {
                count++;
                if (count == k) {
                    result = i;
                }
            }
        }

        // 出力
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 12 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
