e variable n, variable x and variable y are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable dist.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it checks if the current interger i is within the range [0, 4]. If it is, it enters a for loop and it iterates from i to 4 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable dist.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it checks if the current interger j is within the range [0, 4]. If it is, it enters a for loop and it iterates from j to 4 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable dist.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it checks if the current interger k is within the range [0, 4]. If it is, it enters a for loop and it iterates from k to 4 to check each integer l in this range. The value of variable l is also passed to variable dist.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it checks if the current interger l is within the range [0, 4]. If it is, it enters a for loop and it iterates from l to 4 to check each integer m in this range. The value of variable m is also passed to variable dist.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it checks if the current interger m is within the range [0, 4]. If it is, it enters a for loop and it iterates from m to 4 to check each integer n in this range. The value of variable n is also passed to variable dist.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it checks if the current interger n is within the range [0, 4]. If it is, it enters a for loop and it iterates from n to 4 to check each integer o in this range. The value of variable o is also passed to variable dist.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it checks if the current interger o is
