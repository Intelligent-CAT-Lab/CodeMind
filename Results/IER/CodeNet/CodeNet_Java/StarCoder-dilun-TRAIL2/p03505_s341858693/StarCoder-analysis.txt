e variable k, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4000, 2000 and 500 respectively according to the input.
It checks if k is less than or equal to a. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If it is not, it checks if a minus b is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints -1 as output.
If it is not, it calculates the value of expression (k minus b minus 1) divided by (a minus b) times 2 plus 1.
