e variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable fact is initialized with an array of length 3000001.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3000000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable fact[i] by multiplying the previous value of variable fact[i-1] with i.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to m+1 to check each integer numOnes in this range. The value of variable numOnes is also passed to variable numOnes.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans by adding the previous value of variable ans with the value of variable sign multiplied by the value of variable choose(n, numOnes) multiplied by the value of variable getAns(n, (3*m-numOnes)/2, m).
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
