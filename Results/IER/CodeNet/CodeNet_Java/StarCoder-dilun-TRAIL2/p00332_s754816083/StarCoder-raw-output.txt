he variable e is initialized with 0 and variable y is initialized with 2015.
The variable f is initialized with an array of 4 integers. The first element is 1868, the second is 1912, the third is 1926, and the fourth is 1989. The last element is 2017.
The variable g is initialized with an array of 4 characters. The first element is 'M', the second is 'T', the third is 'S', and the fourth is 'H'.
The if statement checks if variable e is equal to 0. If it is, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is less than or equal to the difference between the last element of variable f and 1. If it is, it prints the character at index j of variable g and the integer at index i of variable f plus 1. The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3.
After the loop finishes, it enters the else statement. It prints the value of variable y plus the last element of variable f minus 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        int[] a=new int[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
            a[i]=sc.nextInt();
        }
        int[] b=new int[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
            b[i]=sc.nextInt();
        }
        int[] c=new int[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
            c[i]=a[i]+b[i];
        }
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
            System.out.println(c[i]);
        }
    }
}
