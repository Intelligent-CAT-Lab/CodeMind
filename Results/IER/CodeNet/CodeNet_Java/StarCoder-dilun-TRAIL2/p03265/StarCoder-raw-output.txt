he variable x1, y1, x2 and y2 are initialized with 0, 0, 0 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable a is initialized with x2 - x1, which is 1.
The variable b is initialized with y2 - y1, which is -1.
The variable x3 is initialized with x2 - b, which is 1.
The variable y3 is initialized with y2 + a, which is 0.
The variable x4 is initialized with x3 - a, which is 0.
The variable y4 is initialized with y3 - b, which is 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x3, y3, x4 and y4 as output, which is 0 0 0 2.
<<<Output>>>
0 0 0 2
