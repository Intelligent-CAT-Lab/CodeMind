he variable first_N is initialized with 3 and variable first_M is initialized with 9.
It checks if first_N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of (first_M+1)%MOD.
Otherwise, it checks if (first_M+1)%(first_N-1) is equal to 0. If it is, it calculates the value of first_limit as (first_M+1)/(first_N-1)-1.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of first_limit as (first_M+1)/(first_N-1).
Then it checks if first_limit is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints the value of (first_M+1)%MOD.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of A as first_M+1, the value of B as 2*(first_M+1), the value of C as first_N-1, and the value of limit as first_limit+1.
Then it calculates the value of the final output as (A+B-C)%MOD.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String args[]){

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int M = sc.nextInt();

		int count = 0;

		for(int i=1; i<=N; i++){
			for(int j=1; j<=M; j++){
				if(i%2 == 0 && j%2 == 0){
					count++;
				}
			}
		}

		System.out.println(count);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 and variable M is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in
