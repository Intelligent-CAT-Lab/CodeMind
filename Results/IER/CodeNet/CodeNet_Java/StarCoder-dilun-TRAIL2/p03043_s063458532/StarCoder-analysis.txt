he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable m by repeatedlly doubling the value of variable x.
Then it calculates the value of variable winRatio by dividing 1 by n and dividing 1 by m.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable winRatio as output, which is 0.3333333333333333.
