he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 4, 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable min is initialized with the minimum of a and b, which is 4.
The variable max is initialized with the maximum of a and b, which is 5.
The minimum of min and c is calculated and stored in min.
The maximum of max and c is calculated and stored in max.
The final output is min and max, which is 3 5.
<<<Output>>>
3 5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int min = Math.min(a,b);
        int max = Math.max(a,b);
        System.out.println(Math.min(min,c)+" "+Math.max(max,c));
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
