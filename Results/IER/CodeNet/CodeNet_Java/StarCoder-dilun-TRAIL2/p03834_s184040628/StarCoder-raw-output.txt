TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);) {
            solve(sc);
        }
    }

    public static void solve(Scanner sc) {
        String a = sc.next();
        System.out.println(a.replaceAll(" ", ""));
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```happy newyear enjoy
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with the input.
The replaceAll method replaces all the spaces in the string with empty string.
