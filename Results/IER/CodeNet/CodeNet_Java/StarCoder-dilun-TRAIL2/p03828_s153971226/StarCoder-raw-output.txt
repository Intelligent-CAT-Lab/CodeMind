he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it iterates from 2 to j to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable j.
Inside the while loop, it checks if j is divisible by k. If it is, it divides j by k and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int a[] = new int[n];
		int b[] = new int[n];
		int c[] = new int[n];

		for(int i = 0;i < n;i++){
			a[i] = sc.nextInt();
			b[i] = sc.nextInt();
			c[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}

		int answer = 0;
		for(int i = 0;i < n;i++){
			for(int j = 0;j < n;j++){
				for(int k = 0;k < n;k++){
					if(a[i] + b[j] + c[k] == 0){
						answer++;
					}
				}
			}
		}

		System.out.println(answer);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
