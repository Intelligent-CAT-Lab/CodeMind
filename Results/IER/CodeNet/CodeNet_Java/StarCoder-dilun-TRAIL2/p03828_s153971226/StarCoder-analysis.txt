he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it iterates from 2 to j to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable j.
Inside the while loop, it checks if j is divisible by k. If it is, it divides j by k and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 1.
