he variable S is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input S.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the input S is 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. If it is, it increments the variable currentlength by 1.
If the current character is not 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T', it checks if the variable currentlength is greater than the variable length. If it is, it updates the variable length with the value of variable currentlength.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable length as output, which is 4.
