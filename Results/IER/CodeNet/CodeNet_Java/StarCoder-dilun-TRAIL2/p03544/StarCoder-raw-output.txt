he variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 99 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the previous two integers in the array num.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of the last element of the array num as output, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        long[] num = new long[100];

        for(int i =0;i<100;i++){
            if(i==0){
                num[i]=2;
            }else if(i==1){
                num[i]=1;
            }else{
            num[i] = num[i-1]+num[i-2];
        }
    }

        System.out.println(num[n]);
        

    }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 99 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the previous two integers in the array num.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of the last element of the array num as output, which is 5050.
<<<Output>>>
5050
