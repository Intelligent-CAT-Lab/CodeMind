he variable H is initialized with 10 and variable A is initialized with 4.
The value of variable H is divided by the value of variable A. The result is stored in variable a.
Then variable a is incremented by 1 to get the value of variable b.
Then it checks if the value of variable H is divisible by the value of variable A. If it is, it prints the value of variable a as output.
If it is not, it prints the value of variable b as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int N =sc.nextInt();
      int A =sc.nextInt();
      
      int a =N/A;
      int b =a+1;
      
      if(N%A==0){
      System.out.println(a);
      }
      else if(N%A!=0){
      System.out.println(b);
      }   
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10 and variable A is initialized with 3.
The value of variable N is divided by the value of variable A. The result is stored in variable a.
Then variable a is incremented by 1 to get the value of variable b.
Then it checks if the value of variable N is divisible by the value of variable A. If it is, it prints the value of variable a as output.
If it is not, it prints the value of variable b as output.
