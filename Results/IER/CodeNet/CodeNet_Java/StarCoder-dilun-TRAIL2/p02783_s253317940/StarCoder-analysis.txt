he variable H is initialized with 10 and variable A is initialized with 4.
The value of variable H is divided by the value of variable A. The result is stored in variable a.
Then variable a is incremented by 1 to get the value of variable b.
Then it checks if the value of variable H is divisible by the value of variable A. If it is, it prints the value of variable a as output.
If it is not, it prints the value of variable b as output.
