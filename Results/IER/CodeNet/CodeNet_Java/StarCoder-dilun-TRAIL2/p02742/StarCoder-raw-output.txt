e variable w and variable h are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if w or h is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 as output and returns.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable c by dividing the product of w and h by 2. If the remainder of the division is 0, it adds 1 to the final value of variable c.
It prints the final value of variable c as output.
<<<Output>>>
