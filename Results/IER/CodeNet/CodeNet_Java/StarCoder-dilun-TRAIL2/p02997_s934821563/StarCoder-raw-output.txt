he variable n is initialized with 5 and variable k is initialized with 3.
It creates a list of Pair objects and initializes it with n-1 pairs of numbers.
It calculates the number of pairs of numbers in the list by multiplying n-1 and n-2 and dividing it by 2.
If the calculated number is less than k, it prints -1 as output.
Otherwise, it initializes the variables from and to with 2.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until variable now is less than k.
Inside the while loop, it adds a new pair of numbers to the list l.
It decreases variable now by 1.
If variable to is equal to n, it increases variable from by 1 and sets variable to to be from+1.
Otherwise, it increases variable to by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the size of the list l as output.
It then prints the contents of the list l as output.
