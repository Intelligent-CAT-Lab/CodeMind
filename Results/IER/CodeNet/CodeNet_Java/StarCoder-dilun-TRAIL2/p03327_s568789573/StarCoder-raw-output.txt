e variable a is initialized with 999 according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable a is greater than or equal to 1000. If it is, it prints "ABD" as output. Otherwise, it prints "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABD
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
public static void main(String[] args){
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  int a = sc.nextInt();
  System.out.println(a >= 1000? "ABD":"ABC");
}}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
