he variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is '1'. If it is, it adds 1 to variable sum. If it is not, it subtracts 1 from variable sum.
If the current character is '?', it adds the current index i to the TreeSet index. Then it changes the current character to '0'.
Then it enters a while loop and it checks if the variable sum is less than the variable minPrefix. If it is, it enters the if statement.
If the TreeSet index is empty, it returns Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Otherwise, it removes the last element of the TreeSet index and changes the character at the removed index to '1'. Then it adds 2 to variable sum.
After the while loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is '1'. If it is, it adds 1 to variable sum. If it is not, it subtracts 1 from variable sum.
After the for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is '1'. If it is, it adds 1 to variable sum. If it is not, it subtracts 1 from variable sum.
After the for loop finishes, it calculates the difference between the variable maxPrefix and the variable minPrefix.
Then it prints the final value of the difference as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

class Main {
  static int solve(char [] s, int minPrefix) {
    int sum = 0, maxPrefix = 0;
    TreeSet <Integer> index = new TreeSet <> ();
    for(int i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
      if(s[i] == '1') {
        sum += 1;
      } else {
        sum -= 1;
        if(s[i] == '?') {
          index.add(i);
