he variable a is initialized with 3 integers, which are 1, 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a[i].
After the loop finishes, it sorts the array a in ascending order.
Then it print the fianl value of variable a[2] * 10 + a[1] + a[0] as output, which is 152.
<<<Output>>>
152

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = sc.nextInt();

        int[] a = new int[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            a[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        int max = a[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (a[i] > max) {
                max = a[i];
            }
        }

        System.out.println(max);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
The variable a is initialized with n integers, which are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a[i].
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger a
