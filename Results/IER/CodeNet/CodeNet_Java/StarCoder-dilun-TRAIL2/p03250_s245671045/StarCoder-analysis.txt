he variable a is initialized with 3 integers, which are 1, 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a[i].
After the loop finishes, it sorts the array a in ascending order.
Then it print the fianl value of variable a[2] * 10 + a[1] + a[0] as output, which is 152.
