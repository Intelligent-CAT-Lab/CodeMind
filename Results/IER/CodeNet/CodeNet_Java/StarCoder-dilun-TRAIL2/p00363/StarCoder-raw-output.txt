ble W, variable H and variable c are initialized with 3, 3 and B respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable i.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current interger j is 0, 1, 2 or 3. If it is, it prints the corresponding character '+' or '-' or '|' or '.' based on the condition.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints a new line.
After the first for loop finishes, it prints the final output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int M = scanner.nextInt();
        int K = scanner.nextInt();

        int[][] matrix = new int[N][M];

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
                matrix[i][j] = scanner.nextInt();
            }
        }

        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == K) {
                    sum++;
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable M and variable K are initialized with
