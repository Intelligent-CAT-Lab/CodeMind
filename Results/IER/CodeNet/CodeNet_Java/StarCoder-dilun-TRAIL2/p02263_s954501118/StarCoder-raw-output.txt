he variable rawInputs is initialized with the input string "1 2 +".
It enters a for loop and it iterates over each string in the array rawInputs.
Inside the for loop, it checks the value of the current string. If it is "+", it pops the top two elements from the stack and adds them together. The result is pushed back to the stack.
If it is "-", it pops the top two elements from the stack and subtracts them. The result is pushed back to the stack.
If it is "*", it pops the top two elements from the stack and multiplies them. The result is pushed back to the stack.
If it is any other string, it is pushed back to the stack.
After the loop finishes, it pops the top element from the stack and prints it as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    void solve() {
        // Input
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        // Solve
        int max = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > max) {
                max = arr[i];
            }
        }

        // Output
        System.out.println(max);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Main().solve();
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of size 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to initialize each element of the array arr with the next input integer.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current element of the array arr is greater than the variable max
