he variable rawInputs is initialized with the input string "1 2 +".
It enters a for loop and it iterates over each string in the array rawInputs.
Inside the for loop, it checks the value of the current string. If it is "+", it pops the top two elements from the stack and adds them together. The result is pushed back to the stack.
If it is "-", it pops the top two elements from the stack and subtracts them. The result is pushed back to the stack.
If it is "*", it pops the top two elements from the stack and multiplies them. The result is pushed back to the stack.
If it is any other string, it is pushed back to the stack.
After the loop finishes, it pops the top element from the stack and prints it as output.
