TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        String s = sc.next();
        
        System.out.println(s.substring(s.length()-3,s.length()));
   }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```takahashi
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
