he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 3, 1 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if variable c is less than or equal to the sum of variable a and variable b. If it is, it prints the sum of variable b and variable c.
Otherwise, it prints the product of variable b and variable a plus 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int a = sc.nextInt();
      int b = sc.nextInt();
      int c = sc.nextInt();
      if(c<=a+b)System.out.println(b+c);
      else System.out.println(2*b+a+1);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
