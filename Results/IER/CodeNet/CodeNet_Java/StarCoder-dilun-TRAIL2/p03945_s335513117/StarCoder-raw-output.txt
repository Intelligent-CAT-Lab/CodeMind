e variable s is initialized with the input string "BBBWW".
The variable c is initialized with an array of length s.length() which is 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is not equal to the previous character c[i-1]. If it is not, it increments the value of variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = scan.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = scan.nextInt();
		}
		int count = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
				if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
					count++;
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer 5.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of length n which is 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i+1 to 4 to check each integer j in
