 variable h and variable w are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if h and w are both odd or both even. If they are both odd, it calculates the area of the rectangle and prints it as output.
If they are both even, it calculates the area of the rectangle and prints it as output.
If they are not both odd or both even, it calculates the area of the rectangle and prints it as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = arr[0];
        dp[1] = Math.max(arr[0], arr[1]);
        for(int i = 2; i < n; i++){
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 2] + arr[i], dp[i - 1]);
        }
        System.out.println(dp[n - 1]);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It creates an array of size n and initializes it with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum value of the current interger i and the previous interger i - 1 and the previous interger i - 2 and assigns it to variable dp.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp as output, which is 9.
