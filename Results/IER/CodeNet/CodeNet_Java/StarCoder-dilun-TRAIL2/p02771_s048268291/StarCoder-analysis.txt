e variable set is initialized with an empty set.
It enters a for loop and it iterates 3 times to read 3 integers from the input.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger to the set.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the size of the set is equal to 2. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
