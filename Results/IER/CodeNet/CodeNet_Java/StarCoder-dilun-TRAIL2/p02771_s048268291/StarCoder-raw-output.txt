e variable set is initialized with an empty set.
It enters a for loop and it iterates 3 times to read 3 integers from the input.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger to the set.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the size of the set is equal to 2. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
      
      	for(int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++){
      		set.add(sc.nextInt());
        }

        System.out.println(set.size() == 2? "Yes" : "No");
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
