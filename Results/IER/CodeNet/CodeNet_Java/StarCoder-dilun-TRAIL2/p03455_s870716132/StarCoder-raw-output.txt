he variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the product of a and b is even or odd.
If it is even, it prints "Even" as output.
If it is odd, it prints "Odd" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Odd

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    /**
     * @param args the command line arguments
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO code application logic here
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        if(a>b){
            System.out.println("a is greater than b");
        }
        else if(a<b){
            System.out.println("b is greater than a");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("a and b are equal");
        }

       
    }
    
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is greater than b, b is greater than a or a and b are equal.
If a is greater than b, it prints "a is greater than b" as output.
If b is greater than a, it prints "b is greater than a" as output.
If a and b are equal, it prints "a and b are equal" as output.
<<<Output>>>
a and b are equal
