variable n is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable start.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of ways to choose k numbers from n numbers by using the formula combination(k-1, n-1-k) * fac[k] * fac[n-1-k].
Then it adds the current interger k to variable ans. The condition is met when k is 1,2,3 and 4.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
