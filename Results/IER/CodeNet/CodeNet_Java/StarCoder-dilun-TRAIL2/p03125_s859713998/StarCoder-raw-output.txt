e variable a is initialized with 4 and variable b is initialized with 12.
The value of variable b is divided by the value of variable a. The remainder of the division is checked. If it is 0, then the value of variable a is added to the value of variable b. Otherwise, the value of variable b is subtracted by the value of variable a.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int b = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());

        System.out.println((b % a == 0)? a + b : b - a);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
