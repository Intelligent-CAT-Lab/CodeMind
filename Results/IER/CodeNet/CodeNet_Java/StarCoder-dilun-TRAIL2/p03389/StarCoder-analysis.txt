he variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized with 2, 5 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the maximum value of A, B and C and stores it in variable M.
It checks if the sum of A, B and C is even or odd. If it is even, it calculates the final value of the expression ((3*M-(A+B+C))/2). If it is odd, it calculates the final value of the expression (((3*M+3)-(A+B+C))/2).
