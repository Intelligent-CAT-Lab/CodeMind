he variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized with 2, 5 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the maximum value of A, B and C and stores it in variable M.
It checks if the sum of A, B and C is even or odd. If it is even, it calculates the final value of the expression ((3*M-(A+B+C))/2). If it is odd, it calculates the final value of the expression (((3*M+3)-(A+B+C))/2).

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int A = sc.nextInt();
		int B = sc.nextInt();
		int C = sc.nextInt();
		int M = Math.max(A, Math.max(B, C));

		if((A+B+C)%2 == M%2) {
			System.out.println((3*M-(A+B+C))/2);
		}else {
			System.out.println(((3*M+3)-(A+B+C))/2);
		}

	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
