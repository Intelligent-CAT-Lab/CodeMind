he variable num is initialized with an array of integers.
The variable X is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the length of the array num to 1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum value of the current interger n in the array num that is less than or equal to the value of variable X.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 121.
<<<Output>>>
121

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int max = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            for(int j = i + 1; j < n; j++){
                int sum = arr[i] + arr[j];
                if(sum > max){
                    max = sum;
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of n integers.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum value of the current interger sum that is greater than the value of variable max.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
