he variable a, b, c and k are initialized with 1, 2, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The value of variable ans is calculated by subtracting b from a.
Then it checks if the absolute value of variable ans is greater than 10^18. If it is, it prints "Unfair" as output.
Otherwise, it checks if k is even or odd. If it is even, it prints the value of variable ans as output.
Otherwise, it prints the negative value of variable ans as output.
