he variable s is initialized with the input. The variable c is initialized with 4 zeros.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of the string s is equal to 'K', 'U', 'P' or 'C'. If it is, it increments the corresponding element of the array c by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3. The value of variable j is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it finds the minimum value of the elements of the array c.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of the minimum element of the array c as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	
	void run(){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] a = new int[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
			a[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int[] b = new int[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
			b[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int[] c = new int[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
			c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
		}
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
			System.out.println(c[i]);
		}
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Main().run();
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
