he variable s is initialized with the input string "needed".
The length of the string s is checked. If it is 1, then the output is "-1 -1".
If the length of the string s is 2, then it checks if the first and second characters of the string s are equal. If they are, then the output is "1 2". Otherwise, the output is "-1 -1".
If the length of the string s is greater than 2, then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the string s minus 2. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the characters at positions i-1, i and i+1 of the string s are equal. If they are, then the output is i and i+2. Otherwise, it continues to the next iteration of the for loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is "-1 -1".
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
