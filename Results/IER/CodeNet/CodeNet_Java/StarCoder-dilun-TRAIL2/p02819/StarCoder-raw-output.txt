he variable x is initialized with 20.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable x is prime or not.
If it is not prime, it adds 1 to variable x and checks again.
The loop terminates when the value of variable x becomes prime.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x as output, which is 23.
<<<Output>>>
23

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

	public class Main {

		public static void main(String[] args) {

			Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

			int x = sc.nextInt();
			
			while(!prime(x)) {
				x++;
			}
			System.out.println(x);
			
			
		}
		
		static boolean prime(int x) {
			for(int i=2;i<x;i++) {
				if(x%i==0) {
					return false;
				}
			}
			return true;
		}
		
	}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
