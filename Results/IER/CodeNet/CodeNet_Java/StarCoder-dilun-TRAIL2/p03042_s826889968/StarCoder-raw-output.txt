he variable number_input is initialized with 1905 according to the input.
The variable number_upper is initialized with the integer part of number_input divided by 100.
The variable number_lower is initialized with the integer part of number_input modulo 100.
The if statement checks if both number_upper and number_lower are within the range [1, 12].
The else if statement checks if number_upper is within the range [1, 12].
The else if statement checks if number_lower is within the range [1, 12].
The else statement prints NA as output.
<<<Output>>>
NA

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int number_input = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
    int number_upper = number_input / 100;
    int number_lower = number_input % 100;
    if((1 <= number_upper && number_upper <= 12) && (1 <= number_lower && number_lower <= 12)) {
      System.out.println("AMBIGUOUS");
    } else if(1 <= number_upper && number_upper <= 12) {
      System.out.println("MMYY");
    } else if(1 <= number_lower && number_lower <= 12) {
      System.out.println("YYMM");
    } else {
      System.out.println("NA");
    }
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1205
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
