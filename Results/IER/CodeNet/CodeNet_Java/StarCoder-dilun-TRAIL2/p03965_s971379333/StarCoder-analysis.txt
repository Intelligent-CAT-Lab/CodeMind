he variable s is initialized with the input string "gpg".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is even or odd. If it is even, it checks if the character at index i of the string s is 'p'. If it is, it decrements variable ans by 1.
If it is odd, it checks if the character at index i of the string s is 'g'. If it is, it increments variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is -1.
