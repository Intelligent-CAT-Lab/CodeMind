he variable a is initialized with the input. The variable l is initialized with the length of the input. The variable x is initialized with an array of 26 elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates over each character c in the input. The value of variable c is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it increments the value of the array element at index c-a by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates over each element e in the array x. The value of variable e is also passed to variable e.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the square of the current element e by multiplying it with itself.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates over each element e in the array x. The value of variable e is also passed to variable e.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the squares of the current element e by adding it to the sum of the squares of the previous elements.
After the loop finishes, it divides the sum of the squares of the array x by 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable l+l*l-sum as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
