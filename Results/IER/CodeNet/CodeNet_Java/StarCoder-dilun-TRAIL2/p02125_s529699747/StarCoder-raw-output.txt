he variable num is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of num to the power of i. Then it checks if the calculated value of num is greater than or equal to the value of num to the power of i minus 1. If it is, it continues the loop.
If the condition is not met, it breaks the loop and prints the value of i minus 1 as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
		
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		
		String str = br.readLine();
		int num = Integer.parseInt(str);
		
		int i;
		
		for(i = 0; i < 100; i++){
			if(num >= Math.pow(2, i)-1){
				continue;
			}else{
				break;
			}
		}
		
		System.out.println(i-1);
	}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of num to the power of i. Then it checks if the calculated value of num is greater than or equal to the value of num to the power of i minus 1. If it is, it continues the loop.
If the condition is not met, it breaks the loop and prints the value of i minus 1 as output, which is
