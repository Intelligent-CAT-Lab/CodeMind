he variable num is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of num to the power of i. Then it checks if the calculated value of num is greater than or equal to the value of num to the power of i minus 1. If it is, it continues the loop.
If the condition is not met, it breaks the loop and prints the value of i minus 1 as output, which is 1.
