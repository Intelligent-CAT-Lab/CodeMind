variable n is initialized with 5 and variable k is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 5 to check each integer b in this range. The value of variable b is also passed to variable q.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the quotient q and the remainder r of the division of variable n by variable b.
Then it adds the product of q and (b - k) to variable ans.
Then it adds the maximum of 0 and (r - k + 1) to variable ans.
Then it subtracts 1 from variable ans if k is 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
