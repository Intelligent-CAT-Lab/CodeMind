he variable n is initialized with 2.
The if statement checks if n is in the range [1, 9]. If it is, it calculates the cube of n and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
8

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt();

    if(n%2==0){
      System.out.println("even");
    }
    else{
      System.out.println("odd");
    }

  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2.
The if statement checks if n is even or odd. If it is even, it prints "even". If it is odd, it prints "odd".
<<<Output>>>
even
