he variable n is initialized with 6 and variable d is initialized with 2.
It enters a while loop and it checks if variable n is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it decrements variable n by 1 and 2*d.
The condition of the while loop is met when variable n is 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        solve();
    }

    private static void solve() {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = input.nextInt();
        int d = input.nextInt();

        int ans = 0;

        while(n > 0) {
        	ans++;
        	n = n - 1 - 2*d;
        }

        System.out.println(ans);

    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
