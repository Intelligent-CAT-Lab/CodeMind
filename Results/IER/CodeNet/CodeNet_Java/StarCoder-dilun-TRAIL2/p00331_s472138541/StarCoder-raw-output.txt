he variable a and variable b are initialized with -3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of a and b is greater than 0. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If it is not, it checks if the sum of a and b is less than 0. If it is, it prints -1 as output.
If it is not, it checks if the sum of a and b is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
<<<Output>>>
-1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scan.nextInt();
        int b = scan.nextInt();

        if (a + b > 0) {
            System.out.println("1");
        } else if (a + b < 0) {
            System.out.println("-1");
        } else {
            System.out.println("0");
        }
    }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-3 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
