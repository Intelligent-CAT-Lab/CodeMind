he variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 2, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the bitwise XOR of a and b is even or odd. If it is even, it prints "NO" as output.
If it is odd, it prints "YES" as output.
Then it initializes an arraylist variable ans.
It enters a recursive function solve with parameters A, B and mask.
It checks if the bitwise AND of mask and 1 is 1. If it is, it adds A and B to the arraylist ans.
Then it reverses the bits of mask with a function reverse.
It calculates the value of variable div by finding the index of the first bit in mask that is set to 1.
It calculates the value of variable c by bitwise AND of mask and its complement.
It calculates the value of variable C by bitwise XOR of A and c.
It calls the function solve with parameters A, C, mask.
It calls the function solve with parameters C^ (1 << div), B, mask.
After the function solve finishes, it prints the arraylist ans as output.
<<<Output>>>
