he variable n is initialized with 5 and variable k is initialized with 2.
The if statement checks if variable k is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the square of variable n as output.
If it is not, it enters a for loop and it iterates from variable k + 1 to variable n. The value of variable b is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable answer by adding the product of n / b and (b - k) to variable answer.
Then it calculates the maximum of n % b - k + 1 and 0 and adds it to variable answer.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable answer as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        final Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        final long n = scanner.nextLong();
        final long k = scanner.nextLong();

        long answer = 0;
        for (long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            answer += Math.max(0, i - k) * Math.max(0, k - i);
        }

        System.out.println(answer);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
