he variable n is initialized with 7 and variable k is initialized with 3.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It checks if n is divisible by k. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to 0. If it is not, it sets the value of variable ans to 1.
After the if-else statement, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args){
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int n=Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
int k=Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
//String s=sc.next();
//int[] a=new int[n];
//for(int i=0;i<n;i++){}
int ans;
if(n%k==0){ans=0;}else{ans=1;}
System.out.println(ans);
}}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
