he variable n is initialized with 7 and variable k is initialized with 3.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It checks if n is divisible by k. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to 0. If it is not, it sets the value of variable ans to 1.
After the if-else statement, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
