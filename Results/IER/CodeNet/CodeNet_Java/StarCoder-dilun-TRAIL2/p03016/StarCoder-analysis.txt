he variable L, variable A, variable B and variable M are initialized with 5, 3, 4 and 10007 respectively according to the input.
The variable k is initialized with 10.
The variable l is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates while variable A is greater than variable k. The value of variable k is also passed to variable r.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the minimum of the value of (k - A - 1) / B and L - 1.
Then it calculates the value of variable res by multiplying the value of res with the value of modpow(m, r - l + 1, M).
Then it increments the value of variable l by the value of r + 1.
Then it multiplies the value of variable k by 10.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res[0] as output, which is 10007.
