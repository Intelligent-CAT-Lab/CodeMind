he variable L, variable A, variable B and variable M are initialized with 5, 3, 4 and 10007 respectively according to the input.
The variable k is initialized with 10.
The variable l is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates while variable A is greater than variable k. The value of variable k is also passed to variable r.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the minimum of the value of (k - A - 1) / B and L - 1.
Then it calculates the value of variable res by multiplying the value of res with the value of modpow(m, r - l + 1, M).
Then it increments the value of variable l by the value of r + 1.
Then it multiplies the value of variable k by 10.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res[0] as output, which is 10007.
<<<Output>>>
10007

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    long L = scanner.nextLong();
    long A = scanner.nextLong();
    long B = scanner.nextLong();
    long M = scanner.nextLong();

    long[][] m = new long[3][3];
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) m[1][i] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < 3; i++) m[2][i] = 1;

    long[] res = new long[] {0, A % M, B % M};
    long k = 10;
    long l = 0;
    while (A > k) k *= 10;
    while (l < L) {
      m[0][0] = k % M;
      long r = Math.min((k - A - 1) / B, L - 1);
      res = mult(res, modpow(m, r - l + 1, M), M);
      l = r + 1;
      k *= 1
