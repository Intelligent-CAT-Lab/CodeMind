If the condition is not met, it checks if variable Y is less than or equal to 1925. If it is, it prints "T" and the difference between variable Y and 1911.
If the condition is not met, it checks if variable Y is less than or equal to 1988. If it is, it prints "S" and the difference between variable Y and 1925.
If the condition is not met, it prints "H" and the difference between variable Y and 1988.
