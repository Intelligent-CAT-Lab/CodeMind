he variable A and variable B are initialized with the first and second characters of the input respectively.
The if statement checks if the values of A and B are equal. If they are, it sets the value of variable ans to '='.
If the values of A and B are not equal, it checks if A is greater than B. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to '>'.
If the values of A and B are not equal, it checks if A is less than B. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to '<'.
After the if statement finishes, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is '='.
