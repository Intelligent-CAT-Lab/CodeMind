he variable A, B, C, X and Y are initialized with 1500, 2000, 1600, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable resultA is calculated by multiplying X and A and adding Y and B.
The variable resultB is calculated by checking if X is greater than Y. If it is, it calculates the result by subtracting X by Y and multiplying the result by A and adding Y and C.
If X is not greater than Y, it calculates the result by multiplying X by C and adding the result of subtracting Y by X and multiplying the result by B.
The variable resultC is calculated by multiplying C by the maximum of X and Y and multiplying the result by 2.
The final result is the minimum of the three results calculated above.
