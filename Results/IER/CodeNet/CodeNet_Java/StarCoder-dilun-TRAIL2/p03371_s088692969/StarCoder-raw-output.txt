he variable A, B, C, X and Y are initialized with 1500, 2000, 1600, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable resultA is calculated by multiplying X and A and adding Y and B.
The variable resultB is calculated by checking if X is greater than Y. If it is, it calculates the result by subtracting X by Y and multiplying the result by A and adding Y and C.
If X is not greater than Y, it calculates the result by multiplying X by C and adding the result of subtracting Y by X and multiplying the result by B.
The variable resultC is calculated by multiplying C by the maximum of X and Y and multiplying the result by 2.
The final result is the minimum of the three results calculated above.
<<<Output>>>
1500

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		String[] tokens = in.nextLine().split(" ");
		int N = Integer.parseInt(tokens[0]);
		int M = Integer.parseInt(tokens[1]);
		int[] A = new int[N];
		int[] B = new int[M];
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			A[i] = in.nextInt();
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
			B[i] = in.nextInt();
		}
		int[] C = new int[N + M];
		int i = 0;
		int j = 0;
		int k = 0;
		while (i < N && j < M) {
			if (A[i] < B[j]) {
				C[k] = A[i];
				i++;
				k++;
			} else {
				C[k] = B[j];
				j++;
				k++;
			}
		}
		while (i < N) {
