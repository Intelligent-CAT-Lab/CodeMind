he variable S is initialized with the input string "RRLRL".
The variable N is initialized with the length of the input string.
The variable ans is initialized with an array of length N.
The variable curIndex is initialized with 0.
The while loop enters and it checks if the current index is less than the length of the input string.
Inside the while loop, it initializes two variables numLeft and numRight with 0.
Then it enters a while loop and it checks if the current character of the input string is equal to 'R'.
Inside the while loop, it increments the value of variable curIndex by 1.
Then it checks if the current index is equal to the length of the input string. If it is, it breaks out of the while loop.
Then it decrements the value of variable curIndex by 1.
Then it initializes two variables left and right with the values of variables numLeft and numRight respectively.
Then it checks if the sum of the values of variables numLeft and numRight is even. If it is, it initializes the value of variable sum with the sum of the values of variables numLeft and numRight.
Then it initializes the value of variable left with the value of variable sum divided by 2.
Then it initializes the value of variable right with the value of variable sum minus the value of variable left.
Then it initializes the value of the array ans at the current index R with the value of variable left.
Then it initializes the value of the array ans at the current index R+1 with the value of variable right.
Then it checks if the current index is equal to the length of the input string minus 1. If it is, it breaks out of the while loop.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string minus 1.
Inside the for loop, it prints the value of the array ans at the current index i.
