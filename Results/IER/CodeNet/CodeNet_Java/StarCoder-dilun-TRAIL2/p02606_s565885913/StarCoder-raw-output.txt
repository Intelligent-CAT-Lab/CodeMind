he variable L, variable R and variable d are initialized with 5, 10 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 5 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by 2. If it is, it adds 1 to variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[N];
		int max = 0;
		int min = 1000000000;
		
		for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
			if(arr[i] > max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
			if(arr[i] < min) {
				min = arr[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max - min);
		sc.close();
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 10 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It creates an array of size 5 and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the array element at index i.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates
