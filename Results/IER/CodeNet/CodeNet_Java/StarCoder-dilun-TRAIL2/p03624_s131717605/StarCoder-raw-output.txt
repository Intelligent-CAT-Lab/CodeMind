he variable table is initialized with an empty set.
The variable str is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string str. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it adds the character c to the set table.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 'a' to 'z'. The value of variable c is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character c is not in the set table. If it is not, it prints the character c as output.
After the loop finishes, it prints "None" as output.
<<<Output>>>
