he variable x is initialized with 33.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from -100 to 1000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from -100 to 1000 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable b.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the difference of the two variables a and b and checks if it is equal to variable x. If it is, it prints the values of i and j as output.
