he variable a is initialized with 1.
The if statement is true and it prints "Hello World".
The else statement is false and it enters the second if statement.
The variable b is initialized with 2.
The variable c is initialized with 3.
The value of b+c is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a=scan.nextInt();
		if(a==1) {
			System.out.println("Hello World");
		}
		else if(a==2) {
			int b=scan.nextInt();
			int c=scan.nextInt();
			System.out.println(b+c);
		}
		else {
			int b=scan.nextInt();
			int c=scan.nextInt();
			int d=scan.nextInt();
			System.out.println(b+c+d);
		}
		}
	}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
