he variable a is initialized with 1 and variable b is initialized with 2.
The code enters a while loop and it reads the input from the user.
If the input is a number, it converts it to a long integer and adds it to the list.
If the input is a "+", it calculates the sum of the last two numbers in the list and replaces the last number with the calculated value.
If the input is a "-", it calculates the difference of the last two numbers in the list and replaces the last number with the calculated value.
If the input is a "*", it calculates the product of the last two numbers in the list and replaces the last number with the calculated value.
After the loop finishes, it prints the first number in the list as output, which is 3.
