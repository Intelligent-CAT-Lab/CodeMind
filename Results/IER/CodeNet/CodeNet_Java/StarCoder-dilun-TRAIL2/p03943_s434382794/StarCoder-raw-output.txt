he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 10, 30 and 20 respectively according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with the sum of the three variables a, b and c.
The variable discr is initialized with the value of the discriminant of the quadratic equation.
The discriminant is calculated by multiplying the two sides of the quadratic equation and subtracting the product of the two sides.
The discriminant is 0 when the two sides are equal.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int c = sc.nextInt();
    int sum = a + b + c;
    int discr = (2 * a - sum) * (2 * b - sum) * (2 * c - sum);
    if (discr == 0) {
      System.out.println("Yes");
    } else {
      System.out.println("No");
    }
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 30 20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
