he variable n is initialized with 4 and variable k is initialized with 2.
The variable res is initialized with 0.
The variable row is initialized with 1.
The variable w is initialized with 0.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the value of variable n is greater than or equal to the value of variable row.
If it is, it enters the if statement and it checks if the value of variable row multiplied by the value of variable k is greater than or equal to the value of variable w.
If it is, it enters the if statement and it increments the value of variable res by 1.
Then it increments the value of variable w by the value of variable row.
Then it decrements the value of variable n by the value of variable row.
Then it enters the else statement and it increments the value of variable row by 1.
Then it enters the else statement and it exits the while loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 2.
