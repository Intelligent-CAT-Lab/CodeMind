he variable m, variable rd, variable rr, variable cd, variable cr are initialized with the values of the input.
It calculates the value of variable d by dividing the value of variable cd by the value of variable rd and multiplying the result by 100. Then it increases the value of variable d by 1 until the condition (d*rd)/100==cd is met.
It calculates the value of variable r by dividing the value of variable cr by the value of variable rr and multiplying the result by 100. Then it increases the value of variable r by 1 until the condition (r*rr)/100==cr is met.
It checks if the value of variable m is greater than the sum of the values of variables d and r. If it is, it prints the value of variable m minus the sum of the values of variables d and r. If it is not, it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		int a[] = new int[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) a[i] = sc.nextInt();
		
		int sum = 0;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
			if(a[i]%k==0) sum++;
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}

}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with the values of the input.
It declares an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with the value of the corresponding input.
It initializes variable sum with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this
