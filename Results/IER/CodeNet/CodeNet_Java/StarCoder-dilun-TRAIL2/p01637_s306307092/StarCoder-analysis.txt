he variable m, variable rd, variable rr, variable cd, variable cr are initialized with the values of the input.
It calculates the value of variable d by dividing the value of variable cd by the value of variable rd and multiplying the result by 100. Then it increases the value of variable d by 1 until the condition (d*rd)/100==cd is met.
It calculates the value of variable r by dividing the value of variable cr by the value of variable rr and multiplying the result by 100. Then it increases the value of variable r by 1 until the condition (r*rr)/100==cr is met.
It checks if the value of variable m is greater than the sum of the values of variables d and r. If it is, it prints the value of variable m minus the sum of the values of variables d and r. If it is not, it prints -1.
