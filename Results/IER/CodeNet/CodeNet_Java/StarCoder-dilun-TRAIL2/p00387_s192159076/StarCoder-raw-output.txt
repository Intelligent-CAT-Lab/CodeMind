he variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of expression (b + a - 1) / a.
The expression is evaluated to 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt(), b = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a + b);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of expression a + b.
The expression is evaluated to 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
