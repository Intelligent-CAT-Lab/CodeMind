e variable n is initialized with 1900 according to the input.
Then it calculates the quotient of n by 1000 and stores it in variable x.
Then it calculates the remainder of n by 1000 and stores it in variable y.
If y is 0, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it calculates the difference of 1000 times x plus 1 and n and stores it in variable ans.
Then it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 1000.
