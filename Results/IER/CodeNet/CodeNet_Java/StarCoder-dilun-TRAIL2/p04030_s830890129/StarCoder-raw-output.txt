he variable s is initialized with the input string "01B0".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'B'. If it is, it checks if the length of variable sb is greater than 0. If it is, it deletes the last character of variable sb.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sb as output, which is "01".
<<<Output>>>
01

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.next();
		int count = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
			char c = s.charAt(i);
			if (c == 'B') {
				count++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```01B0
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "01B0".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'B'. If it is, it increments variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
