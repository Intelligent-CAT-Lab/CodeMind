he variable s is initialized with the input string "01B0".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'B'. If it is, it checks if the length of variable sb is greater than 0. If it is, it deletes the last character of variable sb.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sb as output, which is "01".
