variable n is initialized with 10 and variable w is initialized with 2.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the input is exhausted.
Inside the while loop, it initializes an array of size n + 1 with variable count.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to w to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it increments the value of count[j] by 1.
Then it checks if i is divisible by j and j is not equal to i. If it is, it increments the value of count[i / j] by 1.
After the for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to n - w to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it decrements the value of count[j] by 1.
Then it checks if i is divisible by j and j is not equal to i. If it is, it decrements the value of count[i / j] by 1.
After the for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to n - w to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it increments the value of count[j] by 1.
Then it checks if i is divisible by j and j is not equal to i. If it is, it increments the value of count[i / j] by 1.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output.
