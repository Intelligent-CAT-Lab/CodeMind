he variable n, variable m and variable k are initialized with 6, 4 and 0 respectively according to the input.
The variable fact is initialized with an array of size 6+4+2*0+1. The first element of the array is initialized with 1. The second element of the array is initialized with 1.
The for loop iterates from 1 to 6+4+2*0+1 to calculate the value of each element of the array. The value of the current element is calculated by multiplying the current element with the previous element of the array.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 0 to calculate the value of each element of the array. The value of the current element is calculated by multiplying the current element with the previous element of the array.
The while loop iterates until the value of variable ans is less than 0.
The final value of variable ans is printed as output.
