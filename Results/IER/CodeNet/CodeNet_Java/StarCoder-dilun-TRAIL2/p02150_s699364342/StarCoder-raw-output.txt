he variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 3, 1 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable x is greater than or equal to variable a. If it is, it calculates the value of variable figure by dividing the difference between variable x and variable a by the difference between variable a and variable b.
Then it adds the value of variable x to variable count by multiplying the value of variable figure by the value of variable b.
If the value of variable x is less than variable a, it just adds the value of variable x to variable count.
After the if-else statement, it prints the final value of variable count as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	int n = sc.nextInt();
	int a = sc.nextInt();
	int b = sc.nextInt();
	int count=0;
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
		int x = sc.nextInt();
		if(x>=a && x<=b) count++;
	}
	System.out.println(count);
    }
}

</Code>
