he variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 3, 1 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable x is greater than or equal to variable a. If it is, it calculates the value of variable figure by dividing the difference between variable x and variable a by the difference between variable a and variable b.
Then it adds the value of variable x to variable count by multiplying the value of variable figure by the value of variable b.
If the value of variable x is less than variable a, it just adds the value of variable x to variable count.
After the if-else statement, it prints the final value of variable count as output.
