he variable N is initialized with 5700.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the variable N is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the variable N is divisible by 500. If it is, it subtracts 500 from the variable N.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable N as output, which is 500.
<<<Output>>>
500

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        while (sc.hasNextInt()) {
            int N = sc.nextInt();
            System.out.println(N - (N % 100));
        }
    }
}



</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5700
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
