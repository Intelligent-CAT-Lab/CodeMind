he variable n and variable x are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the maximum and minimum of the variables x and n-x.
It enters a while loop and it calculates the value of variable c by calling the method refrect(a, b).
The value of variable c is 0, which means the loop will break.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	static long sum = 0;

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long n = sc.nextLong();
		long x = sc.nextLong();
		
		long a = Math.max(x, n-x);
		long b = Math.min(x, n-x);

		sum = a + b;
		while(true){
			long c = refrect(a, b);
			if(c==0) break;
			a = b;
			b = c;
		}

		System.out.println(sum);
	}

	static long refrect(long a, long b){
		long rest = a%b;
		long times = a/b;

		sum += b*times*2;
		if(rest==0) sum -= b;

		return rest;
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable x are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the maximum and minimum of the variables x and n-x.
It enters a while loop and it calculates the value of variable c by calling the method refrect(a, b).
The value of variable c is 2, which means the loop will continue.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl
