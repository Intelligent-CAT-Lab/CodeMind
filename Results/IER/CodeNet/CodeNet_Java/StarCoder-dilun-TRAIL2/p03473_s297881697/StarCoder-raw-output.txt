he variable M is initialized with 21 according to the input.
It calculates the value of 48 - M and prints the final value as output, which is 17.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int M = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println( N * M );
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10 according to the input.
The variable M is initialized with 20 according to the input.
It calculates the value of N * M and prints the final value as output, which is 200.
<<<Output>>>
200
