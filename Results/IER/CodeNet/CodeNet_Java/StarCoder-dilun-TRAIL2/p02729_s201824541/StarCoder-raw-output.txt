he variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers by using the formula (n * (n-1) / 2).
It calculates the sum of the first m natural numbers by using the formula (m * (m-1) / 2).
The final value of variable total is the sum of the two calculated values.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //コード
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Integer n = Integer.parseInt(scanner.next());
        Integer m = Integer.parseInt(scanner.next());
        int total = 0;

        total += (n * (n-1) / 2);
        total += (m * (m-1) / 2);

        System.out.println(total);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
