he variable line is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates until the input is exhausted.
Inside the for loop, it splits the input line into an array of strings strArray.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of strArray.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current index i is less than or equal to the length of strArray minus 1 and if the value of strArray at index i is equal to the value of strArray at index i plus 1.
If it is, it sets the value of resultNum1 to i plus 1 and the value of resultNum2 to i plus 2.
Then it breaks out of the for loop.
If the condition is not met, it checks if the current index i is less than or equal to the length of strArray minus 2 and if the value of strArray at index i is equal to the value of strArray at index i plus 2.
If it is, it sets the value of resultNum1 to i plus 1 and the value of resultNum2 to i plus 3.
Then it breaks out of the for loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the values of resultNum1 and resultNum2 as output, which is 1 2.
