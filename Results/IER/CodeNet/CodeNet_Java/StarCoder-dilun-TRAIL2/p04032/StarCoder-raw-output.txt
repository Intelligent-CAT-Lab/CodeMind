he variable line is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates until the input is exhausted.
Inside the for loop, it splits the input line into an array of strings strArray.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of strArray.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current index i is less than or equal to the length of strArray minus 1 and if the value of strArray at index i is equal to the value of strArray at index i plus 1.
If it is, it sets the value of resultNum1 to i plus 1 and the value of resultNum2 to i plus 2.
Then it breaks out of the for loop.
If the condition is not met, it checks if the current index i is less than or equal to the length of strArray minus 2 and if the value of strArray at index i is equal to the value of strArray at index i plus 2.
If it is, it sets the value of resultNum1 to i plus 1 and the value of resultNum2 to i plus 3.
Then it breaks out of the for loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the values of resultNum1 and resultNum2 as output, which is 1 2.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Scanner cin = new Scanner(System.in);
		String line;

			line = cin.nextLine();

			String[] strArray = line.split("");
			int resultNum1 = -1;
			int resultNum2 = -1;

			for(int i =0; i < strArray.length; i++){

				if(i + 1 <= strArray.length - 1 && strArray[i].equals(strArray[i + 1])){
					resultNum1 = i + 1;
					resultNum2 = i + 2;
					break;
				}


				if(i + 2 <= strArray.length -
