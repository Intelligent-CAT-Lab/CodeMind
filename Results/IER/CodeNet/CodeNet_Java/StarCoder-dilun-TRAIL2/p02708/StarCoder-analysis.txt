variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable f.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the first i integers by repeatedlly subtracting 1 from i and multiplying it with i.
Then it calculates the sum of the last i integers by repeatedlly adding 1 to i and multiplying it with i.
Then it calculates the difference of the two sums and adds 1 to it.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
