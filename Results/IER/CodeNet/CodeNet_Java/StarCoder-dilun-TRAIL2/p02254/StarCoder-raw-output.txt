he variable s is initialized with the input string "abca".
The variable frequency is initialized with an array of size 26.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it increments the value of the array index corresponding to the character at index i of the string s by 1.
