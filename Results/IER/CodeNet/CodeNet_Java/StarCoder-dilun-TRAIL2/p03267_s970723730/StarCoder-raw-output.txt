he variable l is initialized with 4.
The while loop runs until l is less than or equal to 2^n.
The variable n is initialized with 0.
The for loop runs until bit is less than n-1.
The variable m is initialized with 0.
The variable sb is initialized with an empty string.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
The for loop runs until bit is less than n-1.
The variable bit is initialized with 0.
The variable sb is appended with the string "1 2 0"
The variable m is incremented by 1.
The variable sb is appended with the string "1 2 1"
The variable m is incremented by 1.
The if condition is checked. If it is true, the variable sb is appended with the string "1 n (l-sum-1)"
The variable sum is incremented by 1.
The variable m is incremented by 1.
The variable sb is printed.
