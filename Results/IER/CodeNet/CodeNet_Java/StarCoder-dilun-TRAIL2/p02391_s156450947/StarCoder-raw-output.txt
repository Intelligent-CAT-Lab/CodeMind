he variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is greater than b. If it is, it prints "a > b".
If it is not greater than b, it checks if a is less than b. If it is, it prints "a < b".
If it is not less than b, it prints "a == b".
<<<Output>>>
a < b

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scan.nextInt();
        int b = scan.nextInt();
        if(a > b) System.out.println("a > b");
        else if(a < b) System.out.println("a < b");
        else System.out.println("a == b");
        scan.close();
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is greater than b. If it is, it prints "a > b".
If it is not greater than b, it checks if a is less than b. If it is, it prints "a < b".
If it is not less than b, it prints "a == b".
<<<Output>>>
a == b
