e variable days is initialized with an array of 7 strings, each of which is a day of the week.
The variable in is initialized with the input string.
The variable idx is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each string in the array days. The value of the current string is also passed to variable in.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current string in equals to the input string. If it does, it sets the value of variable idx to the current index of the string in the array days. The condition is met when the current string in is SAT.
After the loop finishes, it sets the value of variable ans to the value of ((6-idx+7)%7). The value of variable ans is 3.
Then it checks if the value of variable ans is 0. If it does, it prints 7 as output. Otherwise, it prints the value of variable ans as output.
