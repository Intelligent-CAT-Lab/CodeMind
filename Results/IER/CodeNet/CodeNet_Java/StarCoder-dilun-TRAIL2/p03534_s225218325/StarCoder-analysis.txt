NO-ANSWER
variable s is initialized with "abac" according to the input.
The variable cnt is initialized with an array of 3 elements.
The for loop iterates from 0 to the length of variable s. The current character of variable s is stored in variable c.
The value of variable c is subtracted by 'a' to get the index of the array cnt.
The value of cnt at the index of variable c is incremented by 1.
The if statement checks if the value of cnt at the index of variable c is greater than 1. If it is, it prints "NO" as output and returns.
