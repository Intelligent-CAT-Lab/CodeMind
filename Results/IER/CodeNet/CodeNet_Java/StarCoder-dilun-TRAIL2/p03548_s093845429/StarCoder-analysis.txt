he variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 13, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if variable answer is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if y+2*z is greater than x. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If variable answer is not equal to 0, it checks if y+z is greater than x. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 2.
