he variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 13, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if variable answer is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if y+2*z is greater than x. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If variable answer is not equal to 0, it checks if y+z is greater than x. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scn=new Scanner(System.in);
        int  x=scn.nextInt();
        int  y=scn.nextInt();
        int  z=scn.nextInt();
        scn.close();
        int answer =0;
        while(true){
            if(answer==0){
                if(y+2*z>x)break;
                answer++;
                x-=y+2*z;
            }else{
                if(y+z>x)break;
                answer++;
                x-=y+z;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(answer);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```13 3 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 13, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if variable answer is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if y+2*z is greater than x. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If variable answer is not equal to 0, it checks if y+z is greater than x. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
