he variable m and variable d are initialized with 15 and 40 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 40 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable den.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current interger j is divisible by 10 and if it is divisible by 10. If it is, it calculates the product of the current interger j and i and checks if it is equal to the current interger i. If it is, it adds 1 to variable result.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 10.
