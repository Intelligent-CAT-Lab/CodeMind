 variable line is initialized with the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the variable line is not null and not empty.
Inside the while loop, it initializes the variables c1, c2 and c3 with 0.
Then it checks if the length of variable line is less than 6. If it is, it prints INVALID.
Otherwise, it enters a for loop and it iterates over each character c in variable line.
Inside the for loop, it checks if c is in the range ['0', '9']. If it is, it increments the value of variable c1 by 1.
It checks if c is in the range ['A', 'Z']. If it is, it increments the value of variable c2 by 1.
It checks if c is in the range ['a', 'z']. If it is, it increments the value of variable c3 by 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if c1 is greater than 0, c2 is greater than 0 and c3 is greater than 0.
If all of these conditions are met, it prints VALID. Otherwise, it prints INVALID.
<<<Output>>>
INVALID
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String line = "";

		while ((line = br.readLine())!= null &&!line.isEmpty()) {
			int c1, c2, c3;
			c1 = c2 = c3 = 0;
			if (line.length() < 6) {
				System.out.println("INVALID");
			} else {
				for (char c : line.toCharArray()) {
					if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') {
						c1++;
					} else if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') {
						c2++;
					} else {
						c3++;
					}
				}
				if (c1 > 0 && c2 > 0 && c3 > 0)
