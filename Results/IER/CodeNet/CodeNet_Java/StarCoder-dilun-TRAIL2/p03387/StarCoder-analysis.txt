he variable x is initialized with 3 elements. The first element is initialized with the first input, the second element is initialized with the second input and the third element is initialized with the third input.
The array x is sorted in ascending order.
The variable temp is initialized with 2 times the third element minus the second element minus the first element.
The variable ans is initialized with the value of variable temp divided by 2.
If the value of variable temp is odd, then it adds 2 to the value of variable ans.
Then it prints the final value of variable ans as output.
