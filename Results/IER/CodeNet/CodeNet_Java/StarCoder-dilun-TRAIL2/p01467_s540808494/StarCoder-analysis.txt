NO-ANSWER
he variable A and variable B are initialized with 99 and 98 respectively according to the input.
The variable k is initialized with 1.
The for loop iterates from 0 to the length of variable A minus the length of variable B plus 1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by calling the function dfs with the following parameters:
i = 0, k = 1, b = 0.
The function dfs returns the value 0.
The for loop iterates from 1 to the length of variable A.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by calling the function dfs with the following parameters:
i = 1, k = 1, b = 0.
The function dfs returns the value 0.
The for loop iterates from 2 to the length of variable A.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by calling the function dfs with the following parameters:
i = 2, k = 1, b = 0.
The function dfs returns the value 0.
The for loop iterates from 3 to the length of variable A.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by calling the function dfs with the following parameters:
i = 3, k = 1, b = 0.
The function dfs returns the value 0.
The for loop iterates from 4 to the length of variable A.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by calling the function dfs with the following parameters:
i = 4, k = 1, b = 0.
The function dfs returns the value 0.
The for loop iterates from 5 to the length of variable A.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by calling the function dfs with the following parameters:
i = 5, k = 1, b = 0.
The function dfs returns the value 0.
The for loop iterates from 6 to the length of variable A.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by calling the function dfs with the following parameters:
i = 6, k = 1, b = 0.
The function dfs returns the value 0.
The for loop iterates from 7 to the length of variable A.
