TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = scan.nextInt();
		scan.close();
		int sum = 0;
		for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++){
			sum += i;
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
