variable str is initialized with the input.
The variable s is initialized with 0.
The variable f is initialized with the length of the string str minus 1.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
The variable c is initialized with the character array of the string str.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the variable f is greater than variable s.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the character at index f of the array c is equal to the character at index s of the array c.
If it is, it increments the variable s and decrements the variable f.
If it is not, it checks if the character at index f of the array c is equal to 'x'.
If it is, it increments the variable count and decrements the variable f.
If it is not, it checks if the character at index s of the array c is equal to 'x'.
If it is, it increments the variable count and increments the variable s.
If it is not, it returns -1.
After the while loop finishes, it returns the value of variable count.
