he variable a, variable b and variable n are initialized with 5, 7 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable x is initialized with the minimum of b - 1 and n.
The variable ans is initialized with the value of a * x / b.
The final value of variable ans is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		
		int x = Math.min(b - 1, n);
		
		int ans = a * x / b;
		
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
	
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
