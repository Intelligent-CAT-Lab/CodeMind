e variable N is initialized with 5 and variable K is initialized with 3.
The code checks if the number of pairs of the yokei is less than K. If it is, it prints -1 as output.
If the number of pairs of the yokei is greater than or equal to K, it calculates the number of pairs of the yokei by subtracting the number of pairs of the yokei from the total number of pairs.
Then it prints the number of pairs of the yokei as output.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to N-1 to print the yokei.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to i-1 to print the yokei.
