he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer m in this range. The value of variable m is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer l in this range. The value of variable l is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger dp by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it prints the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int[] dp = new int[n];
		dp[0] = arr[0];
		dp[1] = Math.max(arr[0], arr[1]);
		for(int i=2; i<n; i++) {
			dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-2]+arr[i], dp[i-1]);
		}
		System.out.println(dp[n-1]);
	}
}
</Code>
