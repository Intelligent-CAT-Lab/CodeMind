he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer m in this range. The value of variable m is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer l in this range. The value of variable l is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger dp by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it prints the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
