he variable a is initialized with 1 and variable p is initialized with 3.
The value of variable p is then updated to 3 + 3 = 6.
The value of variable p is then updated to 6 * 3 = 18.
The value of variable p is then updated to 18 / 2 = 9.5.
The final value of variable p is then printed as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();

		sc.close();

		int d = a + b + c;
		int e = a - b - c;
		int f = a * b * c;

		System.out.print(d + " " + e + " " + f);

	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 1, variable b is initialized with 2 and variable c is initialized with 3.
The value of variable d is then updated to 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
The value of variable e is then updated to 1 - 2 - 3 = -4.
The value of variable f is then updated to 1 * 2 * 3 = 6.
The final values of variables d, e and f are then printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
6 -4 6
