e variable n is initialized with 1 and variable m is initialized with 1.
The value of variable n is passed to the function solve() as parameter.
The value of variable m is passed to the function solve() as parameter.
The function solve() calculates the value of the expression (1L << m) * (1900 * m + 100 * (n - m)) and returns the value to the main function.
The main function prints the value returned by the function solve() as output.
