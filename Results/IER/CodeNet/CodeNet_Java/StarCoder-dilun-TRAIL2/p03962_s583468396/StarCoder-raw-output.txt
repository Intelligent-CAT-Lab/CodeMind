he variable n is initialized with 3.
It checks if a, b and c are equal. If they are, it decrements n by 2.
If a and b are equal, it decrements n by 1.
If a and c are equal, it decrements n by 1.
If b and c are equal, it decrements n by 1.
After the if-else statements, it prints the final value of n as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
 
		Scanner sc  = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int b = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int c = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        
        int n = 3;
        
        if(a==b&&a==c) n -= 2;
        else if(a == b) n--;
        else if(a == c) n--;
        else if(b == c) n--;

        System.out.print( n );
        System.out.println();
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
