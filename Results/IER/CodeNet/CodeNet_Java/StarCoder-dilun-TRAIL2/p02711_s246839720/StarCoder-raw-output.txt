variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger s[i] is equal to 7. If it is, it sets the value of variable flg to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable flg is true. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
	static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007; // 10^9+7
    static final int MAX = 2_147_483_646; // intMax 
    static final int INF = 1_000_000_000; // 10^9  
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int answer = 0;
		for(int i = 1;i < n + 1;i++){
			int num = i;
			int sum = 0;
			while(num!= 0){
				sum += num % 10;
				num /= 10;
			}
			if(sum >= a && sum <= b){
				answer = answer + i;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(answer);
		sc.close();
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input.
