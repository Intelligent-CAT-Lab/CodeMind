variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger s[i] is equal to 7. If it is, it sets the value of variable flg to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable flg is true. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
