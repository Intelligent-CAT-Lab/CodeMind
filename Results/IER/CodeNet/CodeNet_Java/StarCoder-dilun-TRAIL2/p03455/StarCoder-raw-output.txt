he variable X and variable Y are initialized with 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if either X or Y is even. If either of them is even, it prints "Even" and returns.
If none of them is even, it prints "Odd".
<<<Output>>>
Odd

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[N];
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			sum += arr[i];
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input.
Then it creates an array of size 5 and initializes each element with 0.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
