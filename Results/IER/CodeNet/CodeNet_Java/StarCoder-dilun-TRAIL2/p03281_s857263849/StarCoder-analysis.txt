he variable N is initialized with 105.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 105 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to i to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it adds 1 to variable temp.
Then it checks if the calculated variable temp is equal to 8. If it is, it adds 1 to variable cnt. The condition is met when i is 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33,35,37,39,41,43,45,47,49,51,53,55,57,59,61,63,65,67,69,71,73,75,77,79,81,83,85,87,89,91,93,95,97,99,101,103,105.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 10.
