he variable N is initialized with 105.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 105 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to i to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it adds 1 to variable temp.
Then it checks if the calculated variable temp is equal to 8. If it is, it adds 1 to variable cnt. The condition is met when i is 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33,35,37,39,41,43,45,47,49,51,53,55,57,59,61,63,65,67,69,71,73,75,77,79,81,83,85,87,89,91,93,95,97,99,101,103,105.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 10.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int N = sc.nextInt();
    int cnt = 0;
    int temp =0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= N ; i+=2){
      for(int j = 1; j<=i ; j++){
        if(i%j == 0){
          temp++;
        }
      }
      if(temp==8){
        cnt++;
      }
      temp=0;
    }
    System.out.println(cnt);
  }
}


</Code>
