he variable s is initialized with the input string BBBWW.
It creates a new string array str with the same length as the input string.
It initializes the variable counter with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string minus 1.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the substring of the input string from the current index i to the next index i+1 and stores it in the string array str.
Then it checks if the current and the next substring are equal. If they are not equal, it increments the value of variable counter.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable counter as output, which is 3.
