he variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable mod is initialized with 1000000007.
The variable rn is initialized with the square root of n.
The array cnt is initialized with the length of rn + 1.
The first element of cnt is initialized with n.
The for loop iterates from 2 to rn to calculate the value of cnt[i] and cnt[i - 1].
The value of cnt[i] is calculated by dividing n by i.
The value of cnt[i - 1] is calculated by subtracting the value of cnt[i] from n.
The for loop iterates from 1 to rn to calculate the value of dp[i][j].
The value of dp[i][j] is calculated by adding the value of dp[i - 2][j] and the value of cnt[j].
The value of dp[i][j] is calculated by taking the modulo of the calculated value.
The for loop iterates from 1 to rn to calculate the value of dp[i][j].
The value of dp[i][j] is calculated by adding the value of dp[i][j - 1].
The value of dp[i][j] is calculated by taking the modulo of the calculated value.
The for loop iterates from 1 to rn to calculate the value of ans.
The value of ans is calculated by adding the value of dp[k][rn] and the value of dp[k - 1][j] and the value of cnt[j].
The value of ans is calculated by taking the modulo of the calculated value.
The final value of ans is printed as output.
