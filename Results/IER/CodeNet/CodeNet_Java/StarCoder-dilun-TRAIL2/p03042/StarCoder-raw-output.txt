he variable S is initialized with 1905 according to the input.
The variable yy is initialized with the first two digits of variable S.
The variable mm is initialized with the last two digits of variable S.
The if statement checks if the first two digits of variable S are between 1 and 12. If it is, it checks if the last two digits of variable S are between 1 and 12.
If both conditions are met, it prints "AMBIGUOUS".
If the first two digits of variable S are not between 1 and 12, it checks if the last two digits of variable S are between 1 and 12.
If both conditions are met, it prints "MMYY".
If the first two digits of variable S are not between 1 and 12, it checks if the last two digits of variable S are not between 1 and 12.
If both conditions are met, it prints "YYMM".
If none of the conditions are met, it prints "NA".
<<<Output>>>
AMBIGUOUS

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[N];
		for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max = arr[0];
		for(int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
			if(max < arr[i]) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max);
	}

}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input.
