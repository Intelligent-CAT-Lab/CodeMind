e variable c is initialized with the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the current character is 'A' and the next character is 'C'. If it is, it sets the value of variable flg to true.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable flg as output, which is true.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	
	private void doit(){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		while(sc.hasNext()){
			int n = sc.nextInt();
			int [] arr = new int[n];
			for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
				arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
			}
			int sum = 0;
			for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
				sum += arr[i];
			}
			System.out.println(sum);
		}
	}



	private void debug(Object... o) {
		System.out.println("debug = " + Arrays.deepToString(o));
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Main().doit();
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the value of arr[i] with the input.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it adds the value of arr[i] to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the
