he variable A, B and variable X are initialized with 180, 100 and 2400 respectively according to the input.
The variable dp is initialized with an array of size 2400 + 1000 + 1. The array is filled with the value of INF.
The for loop iterates from 0 to X and checks if the value of dp[i + 1000] is greater than the value of dp[i] + A. If it is, it updates the value of dp[i + 1000] to be the value of dp[i] + A.
The for loop iterates from 0 to X + 500 and checks if the value of dp[i + 500] is greater than the value of dp[i] + B. If it is, it updates the value of dp[i + 500] to be the value of dp[i] + B.
The for loop iterates from X + 1000 to X and checks if the value of dp[i] is less than the value of ans. If it is, it updates the value of ans to be the value of dp[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2400.
