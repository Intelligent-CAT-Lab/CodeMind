he variable S is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string minus 2. The value of variable i is also passed to variable X.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the absolute value of the difference between the current interger X and 753.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = sc.next();
        int min = 1000;
        for (int i = 0; i < S.length() - 2; i++) {
            int X = Integer.parseInt(S.substring(i, i + 3));
            min = Math.min(min, Math.abs(X - 753));
        }
        System.out.println(min);
        sc.close();
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1234567876
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
