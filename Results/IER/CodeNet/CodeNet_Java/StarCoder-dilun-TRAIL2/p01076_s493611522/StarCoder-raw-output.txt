he variable N is initialized with 4 and variable D is initialized with 3.
The value of variable ans is calculated by the following formula:
ans = (N - D) * (N - D - 1) / 2 + 2 * (N - D) + D - 2
The value of variable ans is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int D = sc.nextInt();
		int ans = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			int num = sc.nextInt();
			if (num % D == 0) {
				ans++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 and variable D is initialized with 2.
The value of variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger num is divisible by D. If it is, it adds 1 to variable ans. The condition is met when num is 2 and 4.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
