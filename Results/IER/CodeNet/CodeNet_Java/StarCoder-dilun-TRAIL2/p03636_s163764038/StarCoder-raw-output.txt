he variable str is initialized with the input string "internationalization".
The variable n is initialized with the length of the string str.
The variable h is initialized with the first character of the string str.
The variable t is initialized with the last character of the string str.
The output is the concatenation of the variables h, n-2 and t.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    String str = sc.nextLine();
    int n = str.length();
    char h = str.charAt(0);
    char t = str.charAt(n-1);
    System.out.println(h+""+(n-2)+""+t);
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```internationalization
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
