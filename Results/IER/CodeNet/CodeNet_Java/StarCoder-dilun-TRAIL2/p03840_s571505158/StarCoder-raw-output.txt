he variable I, variable O, variable T, variable J, variable L, variable S and variable Z are initialized with 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 and 0 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It checks if the variables J and L are both greater than 0 and if variable I is greater than 0. If both conditions are met, it calculates the maximum value of the expression (I - 1) / 2 * 2 + 3 + (J - 1) / 2 * 2 + (L - 1) / 2 * 2 and assigns it to variable ans.
Then it adds the value of variable O to variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int N = sc.nextInt();
    int[] arr = new int[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
          ans++;
        }
      }
    }
    System.out.println(ans);
  }

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input.
The array arr is initialized with 5 elements.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
