he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 3 and 8 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is less than b and b is less than c. If it is true, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		String inStr;
		inStr = inp();
		String[] in;
		in = inStr.split(" ");

		int a = Integer.valueOf(in[0]);
		int b = Integer.valueOf(in[1]);
		int c = Integer.valueOf(in[2]);

		if (a < b && b < c)
			System.out.println("Yes");
		else
			System.out.println("No");

	}

	private static String inp() throws Exception {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		return br.readLine();
	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 8
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 3 and 8 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is less than b and b is less than c. If it is true, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
