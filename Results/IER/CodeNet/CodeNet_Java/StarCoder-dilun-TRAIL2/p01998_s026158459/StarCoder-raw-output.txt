 variable N is initialized with 3.
It enters a while loop and it iterates as long as the input is valid.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current integer p is prime. If it is, it checks if p + 2 is prime. If it is, it increments variable ans by 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        while (sc.hasNextInt()) {
            int N = sc.nextInt();
            int ans = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
                if ( N % i == 0 ) {
                    ans += i;
                }
            }

            System.out.println(ans);
        }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10.
It enters a while loop and it iterates as long as the input is valid.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the sum of all the divisors of the current integer i by repeatedlly dividing the current integer i by all the integers in the range [1, N] and adding the result to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 21.
<<<Output>>>
21
