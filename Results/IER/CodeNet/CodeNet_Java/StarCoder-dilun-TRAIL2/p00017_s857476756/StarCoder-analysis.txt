he code first reads the input line by line and stores it in variable s.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it creates a new string builder object sb and it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of string s to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character c from string s at index j and it checks if c is in the range [a, z]. If it is, it subtracts variable i from c. If the result is less than 97, it adds 26 to it.
Then it appends the character c to string builder sb.
Then it checks if the string builder sb contains the string "the", "this" or "that". If it does, it prints the string builder sb.
