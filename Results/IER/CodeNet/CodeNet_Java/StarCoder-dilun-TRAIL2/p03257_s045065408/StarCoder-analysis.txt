NO-ANSWER
variable n is initialized with 2.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until it breaks.
Inside the while loop, it initializes two arrays plus and minus with n + n elements.
It then enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n + n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to initialize each element of plus and minus arrays.
It then enters another for loop
