variable qq is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1 to check each integer casenum in this range. The value of variable casenum is also passed to variable qq.
Inside the for loop, it reads a line of input and stores it in variable s.
Then it initializes an array of boolean values with length of s.length()+1. The first element of the array is initialized with true.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to s.length() to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each string out in this range. The value of variable out is also passed to variable out.
Inside the for loop, it initializes an integer variable match with 0.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to out.length() to check each integer a in this range. The value of variable a is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i+a of string s is equal to the character at index a of string out. If it is, it increments variable match by 1.
If the value of variable match is equal to out.length(), it sets the element at index i+match of the array poss to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the element at index s.length() of the array poss is true. If it is, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
