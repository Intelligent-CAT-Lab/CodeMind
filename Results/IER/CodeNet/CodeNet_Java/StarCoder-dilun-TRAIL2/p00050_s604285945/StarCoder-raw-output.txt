he variable str is initialized with the input.
The replace method replaces the word "apple" with the word "temp" in the variable str.
The replace method replaces the word "peach" with the word "apple" in the variable str.
The replace method replaces the word "temp" with the word "peach" in the variable str.
The output is the final value of variable str.
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one temp is higher than that of one peach.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    while(sc.hasNext()) {
      String str = sc.nextLine();
      String[] strArr = str.split(" ");
      int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
      int k = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
      int[] arr = new int[n];
      for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
        arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
      }
      int[] arr2 = new int[n];
      for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
        arr2[i] = arr[i];
      }
      Arrays.sort(arr2);
      int sum = 0;
      for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
        sum += arr2[i];
      }
      System.out.println(sum - arr2[n-k]);
    }
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized with the input.
The split method splits the variable str into an array of strings. The delimiter is the space character.
The variable n is initialized with the first element of the array of strings.
The variable k is initialized with the second element of the array of strings.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of n integers.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n-1 and
