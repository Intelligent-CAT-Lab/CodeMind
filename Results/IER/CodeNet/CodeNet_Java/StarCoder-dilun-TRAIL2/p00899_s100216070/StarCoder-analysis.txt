he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until n is 0.
Inside the while loop, it initializes an array of strings s with size n.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to initialize each string s[i] with the next input.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check if the current string s[j] matches the pattern of s[i].
If it does, it sets the flag flg to true.
If the flag flg is false, it adds the current string s[i] to the list of strings list.
Then it initializes the variable n with the size of list.
Then it initializes an array of integers pass with size n x n.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to initialize each integer pass[i][j] with the length of string s[j].
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from the length of string s[j] to 0 to check if the current substring of string s[j] matches the suffix of string s[i].
If it does, it sets the value of pass[i][j] to the length of string s[j] minus the length of the current substring.
Then it initializes an array of integers dp with size n x 2^n.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to initialize each integer dp[i][j] with the value of integer INF.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to initialize each integer dp[i][j] with the length of string s[i].
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2^n - 1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of integer dp[j][i] is equal to integer INF. If it is, it skips the current iteration.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0
