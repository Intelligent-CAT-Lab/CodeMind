he variable pat is initialized with the regular expression "A{0,1}KIHA{0,1}BA{0,1}RA{0,1}".
The variable s is initialized with the input.
The method matches() of the String class is used to check if the input matches the regular expression pat.
If it does, it prints "YES" as output.
If it does not, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        String pat = "A{0,1}KIHA{0,1}BA{0,1}RA{0,1}";
        if(s.matches(pat)) System.out.println("YES");
        else System.out.println("NO");
        sc.close();
    }

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```KIHBR
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
