he variable N is initialized with 3 and variable M is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer k in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[i % 2][j][k] by multiplying the value of dp[i % 2][j][k] with (k - j).
Then it calculates the value of dp[(i + 1) % 2][j][k] by adding the value of dp[i % 2][j][k] with (k - j) and modding it with MODULO.
Then it calculates the value of dp[(i + 1) % 2][k][k] by adding the value of dp[i % 2][j][k] with j and modding it with MODULO.
Then it calculates the value of dp[(i + 1) % 2][j][k + 1] by adding the value of dp[i % 2][j][k] with (N - k) and modding it with MODULO.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of dp[M % 2][N][N] as output, which is 10.
