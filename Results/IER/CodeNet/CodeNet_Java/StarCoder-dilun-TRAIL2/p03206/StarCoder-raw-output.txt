he variable D is initialized with 25 according to the input.
It checks if D is equal to 25. If it is, it prints "Christmas" as output.
It checks if D is equal to 24. If it is, it prints "Christmas Eve" as output.
It checks if D is equal to 23. If it is, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve" as output.
It checks if D is equal to 22. If it is, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve Eve" as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner stdIn=new Scanner(System.in);
		int D=stdIn.nextInt();
		if(D==25)
			System.out.println("Christmas");
		if(D==24)
			System.out.println("Christmas Eve");
		if(D==23)
			System.out.println("Christmas Eve Eve");
		if(D==22)
			System.out.println("Christmas Eve Eve Eve");
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```24
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable D is initialized with 24 according to the input.
It checks if D is equal to 25. If it is, it prints "Christmas" as output.
It checks if D is equal to 24. If it is, it prints "Christmas Eve" as output.
It checks if D is equal to 23. If it is, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve" as output.
It checks if D is equal to 22. If it is, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve Eve" as output.
