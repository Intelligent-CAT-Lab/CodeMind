he variable N is initialized with 4.
The final output is calculated by dividing (N+1)/2 by N.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {
	Scanner sc;

	Main() {
		sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	}
	
	void calc() {
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
			sum += i;
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Main().calc();
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 1 to 4 and adds the current interger i to variable sum.
The final output is the value of variable sum.
<<<Output>>>
