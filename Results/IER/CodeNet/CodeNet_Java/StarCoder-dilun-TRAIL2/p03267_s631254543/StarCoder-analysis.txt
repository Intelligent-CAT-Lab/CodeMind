he variable l is initialized with 4.
It enters a while loop and it checks if (1<<n-1)-1<l. The value of n is initialized with 1 and the value of m is initialized with 0.
Inside the while loop, it appends the string value of i and i+1 and 0 to the string builder sb. It also appends the string value of i, i+1 and 1<<(i-1) to the string builder sb.
The value of m is incremented by 2.
The while loop continues until it finds that (1<<n-1)-1<l. The value of n is incremented by 1.
The while loop continues until it finds that l-max>1. The value of max is incremented by (1<<k-1).
The while loop continues until it finds that l-max<=1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the values of n and m as output, which is 3 and 10.
