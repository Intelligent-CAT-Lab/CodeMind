he variable x1, y1, x2 and y2 are initialized with 0, 0, 0 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The value of variable diffX is calculated by subtracting x2 from x1. The value of variable diffY is calculated by subtracting y2 from y1.
The value of variable x3 is calculated by subtracting diffY from x2. The value of variable y3 is calculated by adding diffX to y2.
The value of variable x4 is calculated by subtracting diffX from x3. The value of variable y4 is calculated by subtracting diffY from y3.
After the calculations, it prints the values of variables x3, y3, x4 and y4 as output, which is 0 1 0 0.
<<<Output>>>
0 1 0 0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x1 = sc.nextInt();
		int y1 = sc.nextInt();
		int x2 = sc.nextInt();
		int y2 = sc.nextInt();

		int x3;
		int y3;
		int x4;
		int y4;

		int diffX = x2-x1;
		int diffY = y2-y1;
		x3 = x2 - diffY;
		y3 = y2 + diffX;
		x4 = x3 - diffX;
		y4 = y3 - diffY;
		System.out.println(x3 + " " + y3 + " " + x4 + " " + y4);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0 0 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x1, y1, x2 and y2 are initialized with 0, 0, 0 and 1 respectively according to the input
