he variable W, variable H, variable x and variable y are initialized with 2, 3, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable men is initialized with the formula (W*H)/2.0.
The variable a is initialized with the formula x*H.
The variable b is initialized with the formula (W*H)-a.
The variable c is initialized with the formula y*W.
The variable d is initialized with the formula (W*H)-c.
The variable xx is initialized with the minimum of a and b.
The variable yy is initialized with the minimum of c and d.
The variable hou is initialized with 0.
It checks if the value of xx is equal to the value of men. If it is, it increases the value of variable hou by 1.
It checks if the value of yy is equal to the value of men. If it is, it increases the value of variable hou by 1.
It checks if the value of hou is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it sets the value of variable hou to 0.
It checks if the value of hou is greater than 1. If it is, it sets the value of variable hou to 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable men and variable hou as output, which is 3.0 1.
