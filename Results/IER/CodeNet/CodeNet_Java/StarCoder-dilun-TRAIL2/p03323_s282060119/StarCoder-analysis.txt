he code first reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it enters a while loop and it keeps reading integers from the input until it reaches the end of the input.
Inside the while loop, it checks if both a and b are less than 9. If they are, it prints "Yay!" otherwise it prints ":(".
