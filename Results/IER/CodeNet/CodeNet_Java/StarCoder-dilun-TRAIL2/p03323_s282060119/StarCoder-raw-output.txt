he code first reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it enters a while loop and it keeps reading integers from the input until it reaches the end of the input.
Inside the while loop, it checks if both a and b are less than 9. If they are, it prints "Yay!" otherwise it prints ":(".
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
            while (sc.hasNextInt()) {
                int a = sc.nextInt();
                int b = sc.nextInt();
                System.out.println((a<9&&b<9)?"Yay!":":(");
            }
        }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
