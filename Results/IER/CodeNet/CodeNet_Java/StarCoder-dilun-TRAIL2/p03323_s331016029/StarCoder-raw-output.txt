he variable a and variable b are initialized with 5 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the values of a and b are less than or equal to 8. If they are, it prints "Yay!" as output.
If they are not, it prints ":(" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {	
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt(), b = sc.nextInt();
		if(a <= 8 && b <= 8) {
			System.out.println("Yay!");
		} else {
			System.out.println(":(");
		}
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 9
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
