variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 10, 30 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of a and b is equal to c. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
If the sum of a and c is equal to b, it prints "Yes" as output.
If the sum of b and c is equal to a, it prints "Yes" as output.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();

        int sum = a + b + c;
        int diff = Math.abs(a - b);
        int prod = a * b * c;

        if (sum == n) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else if (diff == n) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else if (prod == n) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }

    }

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3 5 7```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 10, 3, 5 and 7 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of a, b and c is equal to n. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
If the absolute difference of a and b is equal to n, it prints "Yes" as output.
If the product of a, b and c is equal to n, it prints "Yes" as output.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No" as output.
