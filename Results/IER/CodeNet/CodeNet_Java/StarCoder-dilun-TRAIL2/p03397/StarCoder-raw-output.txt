 variable s is initialized with the input string "1??00".
The variable go is initialized with a 2D array of size 10.
The variable start is initialized with 9.
The variable win is initialized with the string "W?W?L?W?L?".
The variable states is initialized with the length of the string "W?W?L?W?L?".
The variable dp is initialized with an array of size states.
The variable ndp is initialized with an array of size states.
The variable tmp is initialized with an array of size states.
The variable res is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates over the characters in the string s.
Inside the for loop, the while loop iterates over the states in the array dp.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the character c is either '0' or '?'. If it is, it adds the value of dp[st] to ndp[next].
If the character c is either '1' or '?', it adds the value of dp[st] to ndp[next].
The tmp array is assigned the value of dp.
The dp array is assigned the value of ndp.
The ndp array is assigned the value of tmp.
The for loop iterates over the states in the array dp.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of dp[i] is 0. If it is, it skips the current iteration.
The for loop iterates over the states in the array dp.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character w is '?'. If it is, it throws an AssertionError.
If the character w is 'W', it adds the value of dp[i] to res.
The output is the value of res modulo 1000000007.
