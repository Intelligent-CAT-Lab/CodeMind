he variable n is initialized with 67 according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable n is within the range ['a', 'z'] or ['A', 'Z']. If it is, it assigns 2 to variable ans.
If it is not, it assigns 1 to variable ans.
After the if-else statement, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int ans = 0;
        if (n >= 'a' && n <= 'z') {
            ans = 2;
        } else if (n >= 'A' && n <= 'Z') {
            ans = 1;
        } else if (n >= '0' && n <= '9') {
            ans = 3;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```67
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
