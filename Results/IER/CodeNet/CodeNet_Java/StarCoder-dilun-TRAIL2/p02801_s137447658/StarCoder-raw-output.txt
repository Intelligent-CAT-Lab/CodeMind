he variable str is initialized with the input.
The variable a is initialized with the first character of the string str.
The variable b is initialized with the ASCII value of the character a.
The variable c is initialized with the ASCII value of the character b+1.
The output is the character c.
<<<Output>>>
b
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    String str = sc.next();
    char a = str.charAt(0);
    int b = (int)a;
    char c = (char)(b+1);    
    System.out.println(c);
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```a
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
