he variable s is initialized with the input string.
It splits the string s into an array of characters ch.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the array ch.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current index i is evenly divisible by 2 and if the character at index i is either "R", "U" or "D".
If the condition is met, it sets the value of variable ans to "No".
If the condition is not met, it checks if the current index i is oddly divisible by 2 and if the character at index i is either "L", "U" or "D".
If the condition is met, it sets the value of variable ans to "No".
If the condition is not met, it sets the value of variable ans to "Yes".
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is "Yes".
