he variable s is initialized with the input string.
It splits the string s into an array of characters ch.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the array ch.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current index i is evenly divisible by 2 and if the character at index i is either "R", "U" or "D".
If the condition is met, it sets the value of variable ans to "No".
If the condition is not met, it checks if the current index i is oddly divisible by 2 and if the character at index i is either "L", "U" or "D".
If the condition is met, it sets the value of variable ans to "No".
If the condition is not met, it sets the value of variable ans to "Yes".
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max = arr[0];
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			if (arr[i] > max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1

```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer.
It creates an array of integers arr with length n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the
