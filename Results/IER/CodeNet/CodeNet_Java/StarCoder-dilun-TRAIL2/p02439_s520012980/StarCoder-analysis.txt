he variable array is initialized with 3 elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable array[i].
Inside the for loop, it reads 3 integers from the input and stores them in the array.
After the loop finishes, it sorts the array in ascending order.
Then it prints the first and the third element of the array as output, which is 3 5.
