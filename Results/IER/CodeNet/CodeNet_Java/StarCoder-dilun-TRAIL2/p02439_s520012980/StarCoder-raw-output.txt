he variable array is initialized with 3 elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable array[i].
Inside the for loop, it reads 3 integers from the input and stores them in the array.
After the loop finishes, it sorts the array in ascending order.
Then it prints the first and the third element of the array as output, which is 3 5.
<<<Output>>>
3 5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] array = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			array[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max = array[0];
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			if (array[i] > max) {
				max = array[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
The variable array is initialized with n elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable array[i].
Inside the for loop, it reads 5 integers from the input and stores them in the array.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable array[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger array[i]
