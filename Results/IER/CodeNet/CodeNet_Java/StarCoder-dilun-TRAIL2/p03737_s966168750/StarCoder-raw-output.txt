he variable S is initialized with the input string "atcoder beginner contest".
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each string s in the array S.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the first character of the current string s and converts it to upper case.
Then it appends the converted character to the variable sb.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable sb as output, which is "Atcoder Beginner Contest".
<<<Output>>>
Atcoder Beginner Contest

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String[] S = sc.nextLine().split(" ");

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (String s : S) {
            String upperCase = s.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase();
            sb.append(upperCase);
        }

        System.out.println(sb.toString());
    }
}

</Code>
