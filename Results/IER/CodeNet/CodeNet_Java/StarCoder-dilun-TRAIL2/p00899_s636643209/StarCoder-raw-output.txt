e variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until n is 0.
Inside the while loop, it initializes an array of strings s with size n.
Then it initializes an array of boolean values unvalid with size n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the bit of i is 1. If it is, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the bit of j is 1. If it is, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of string s[j] to check each integer k in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the substring of s[j] starting from index k and ending at index k+s[i].length() is equal to s[i]. If it is, it sets the bit of i to 0.
After the for loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range.
