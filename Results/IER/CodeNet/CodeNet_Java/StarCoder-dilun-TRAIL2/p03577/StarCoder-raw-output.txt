he variable line is initialized with the input string. The variable length is initialized with the length of the input string.
The substring method is called on the variable line with the arguments 0 and length-8. The substring method returns a substring of the variable line starting from index 0 and ending at index length-8.
The substring method returns the string CODEFEST.
<<<Output>>>
CODEFEST
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String line = sc.next();
        int length = line.length();
        System.out.println(line.substring(0,length-8));
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```CODEFESTIVAL
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
