he variable N and variable M are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable X is initialized with 1900 * M + 100 * (N - M) = 1900 * 1 + 100 * (1 - 1) = 1900 + 0 = 1900.
The variable rate is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to M to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable rate.
Inside the for loop, it multiplies the current interger i to variable rate.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable rate * X as output, which is 1900.
