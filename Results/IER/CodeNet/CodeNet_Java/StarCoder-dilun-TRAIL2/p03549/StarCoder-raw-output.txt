he variable N and variable M are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable X is initialized with 1900 * M + 100 * (N - M) = 1900 * 1 + 100 * (1 - 1) = 1900 + 0 = 1900.
The variable rate is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to M to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable rate.
Inside the for loop, it multiplies the current interger i to variable rate.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable rate * X as output, which is 1900.
<<<Output>>>
1900

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main (String[] args) {

    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    int N = sc.nextInt();
    int M = sc.nextInt();

    sc.close();

    int X = 1900 * M + 100 * (N - M);

    int rate = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i <= M; i++){
      rate *= 2;
    }

    System.out.println(rate * X);

  }

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable M are initialized with 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable X is initialized with 1900 * M + 100 * (N - M) = 1900 * 2 + 100 * (1 - 2) = 1900 + 0 = 1900.
The variable rate is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to M to check each integer i in this range. The
