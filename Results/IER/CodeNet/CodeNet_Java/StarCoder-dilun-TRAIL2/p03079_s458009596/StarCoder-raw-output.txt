he variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized with 2, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if all three variables are equal. If they are, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        int C = sc.nextInt();

        if(A==B || A==C || B==C){
            System.out.println("Yes");
        }else{
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
