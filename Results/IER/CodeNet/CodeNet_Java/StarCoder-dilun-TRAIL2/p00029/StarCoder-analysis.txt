he variable s is initialized with a string array of size 2002. The variable index is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it reads the input from the user and stores it in the string array s.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the input is not empty. If it is not empty, it stores the input in the string array s and increments the value of variable index by 1.
After the while loop finishes, it initializes the variable r with an integer array of size index. It also initializes the variable flag with a boolean array of size 2002.
It fills the boolean array flag with true.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to index-1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i+1 to index-1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the string s[i] is equal to string s[j] and if flag[j] is true. If it is true, it increments the value of variable r[i] by 1.
After the second for loop finishes, it initializes the variable max with 0 and the variable maxin with 0.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to index-1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the value of variable max is less than the value of r[i]. If it is true, it updates the value of variable max to the value of r[i] and updates the value of variable maxin to the value of i.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints the string s[maxin] and the string s[max].
