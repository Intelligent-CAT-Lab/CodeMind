he variable N is initialized with 575.
The variable digit is initialized with the value of log10(N) + 1.
The function sevenfivethree is called with the value of variable digit as argument.
Inside the function sevenfivethree, the function semisevenfivethree is called with the value of variable digit as argument and an empty string as argument.
Inside the function semisevenfivethree, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to variable N to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calls the function semisevenfivethree recursively with the value of variable N-1 and the string a + "3" as arguments.
Inside the function semisevenfivethree, it calls the function semisevenfivethree recursively with the value of variable N-1 and the string a + "5" as arguments.
Inside the function semisevenfivethree, it calls the function semisevenfivethree recursively with the value of variable N-1 and the string a + "7" as arguments.
After the for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the size of the list s to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the string s.get(i) contains the substring "3", "5" and "7". If it does, it adds the string s.get(i) to the list t.
After the for loop finishes, it sorts the list t in ascending order and it returns the list t.
After the function sevenfivethree finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the size of the list t to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the string t.get(i) contains the substring "3", "5" and "7". If it does, it prints the string t.get(i) as output.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the size of the list t as output.
