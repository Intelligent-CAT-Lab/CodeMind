riable s is initialized with the input string "A??C".
The variable n is initialized with the length of the input string.
The variable a is initialized with an array of length n.
The variable c is initialized with an array of length n.
The variable da is initialized with an array of length n.
The variable dc is initialized with an array of length n.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The variable t is initialized with an array of length n+1.
The variable e is initialized with 0.
The variable f is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 1 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
