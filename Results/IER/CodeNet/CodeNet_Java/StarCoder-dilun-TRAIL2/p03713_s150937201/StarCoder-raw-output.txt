e variable h and variable w are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to w-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable w1.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable w2, w3 and h1, h2 and h3.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to w-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable w1.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable w2, w3 and h1, h2 and h3.
After the second for loop finishes, it calculates the value of variable ans by calling the method calc.
After the for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Main main = new Main();
		main.run();
	}

	public void run() {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int h=sc.nextInt();
		int w=sc.nextInt();

		long ans = Long.MAX_VALUE;

		for(int k=0; k<2; k++) {
			if(k==1) {
				int tmp = h;
				h=w;
				w=tmp;
			}
			//初めに縦
			for(int i=1; i<w; i++) {

				if(w>=3){
					//縦縦
					long w1 = i;
					long w2=(w-w1)/2;
					long w3=w2;
					if((w-w1)%2!=0) {
						w3++;
					}
					long h
