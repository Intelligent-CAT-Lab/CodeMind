variable s is initialized with the input string "ABCABC".
It enters a for loop and it iterates over each character c in the string s.
Inside the for loop, it adds the character c to the end of the queue q.
Then it enters a while loop and it iterates until the queue q is empty.
Inside the while loop, it pops the first character c from the front of the queue q.
Then it checks if the character c is 'A'. If it is, it increments the variable anum by 1.
Then it checks if the character c is 'B'. If it is, it checks if the queue q is empty. If it is, it breaks out of the while loop.
Otherwise, it peeks the first character c from the front of the queue q.
Then it checks if the character c is 'C'. If it is, it pops the first character c from the front of the queue q.
Otherwise, it resets the variable anum to 0.
After the while loop finishes, it checks if the queue q is empty. If it is, it breaks out of the while loop.
Otherwise, it peeks the first character c from the front of the queue q.
Then it checks if the character c is 'A'. If it is, it pops the first character c from the front of the queue q.
Otherwise, it resets the variable anum to 0.
After the while loop finishes, it checks if the queue q is empty. If it is, it breaks out of the while loop.
Otherwise, it peeks the first character c from the front of the queue q.
Then it checks if the character c is 'B'. If it is, it pops the first character c from the front of the queue q.
Otherwise, it resets the variable anum to 0.
After the while loop finishes, it checks if the queue q is empty. If it is, it breaks out of the while loop.
Otherwise, it peeks the first character c from the front of the queue q.
Then it checks if the character c is 'C'. If it is, it pops the first character c from the front of the queue q.
Otherwise, it resets the variable anum to 0.
After the while loop finishes, it checks if the queue q is empty.
