he variable a, variable b and variable goal are initialized with 3, 0 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the variable coin is less than the variable goal.
Inside the while loop, it increments the variable day by 1. Then it adds the value of variable a to variable coin.
Then it checks if the current value of variable day is divisible by 7. If it is, it adds the value of variable b to variable coin.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable day-1 as output, which is 11.
