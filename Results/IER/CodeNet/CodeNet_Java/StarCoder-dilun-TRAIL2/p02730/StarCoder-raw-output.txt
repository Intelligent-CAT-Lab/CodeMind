he variable s is initialized with the input string "akasaka".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the half of the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string s is equal to the current character of the reversed string s. If it is not, it prints "No" as output and returns.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the half of the length of the string s minus 1. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string s is equal to the current character of the reversed string s minus 1. If it is not, it prints "No" as output and returns.
After the loop finishes, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
                try {
                        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
                        String str = br.readLine();
                        int n = Integer.parseInt(str);
                        int[] arr = new int[n];
                        int sum = 0;

                        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                                arr[i] = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
                        }

                        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                                sum += arr[i];
                        }

                        System.out.println(sum);
                } catch (IOException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                }
        }

}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1. The
