e variable n is initialized with 3 and variable m is initialized with 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from n/2+1 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ns.
Inside the for loop, it assigns the value of variable m to the current interger i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ns as output, which is 100 100 100.
<<<Output>>>
100 100 100

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String line;

		//?????????: 0 - m

		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();

		int[] ns = new int[n];

		if (n > 2) {
			for (int i = n / 2 + 1; i < n; i++) {
				ns[i] = m;
			}
		}
		
		System.out.print(ns[0]);
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			System.out.print(" " + ns[i]);
		}
		System.out.println();
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
