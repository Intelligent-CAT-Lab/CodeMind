NO-ANSWER
e variable n is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable str2.
Inside the for loop, it concatenates the current interger i to variable str.
After the loop finishes, it calls the method permutation with the following parameters:
q = str = "12"
ans = ""
The method permutation is called recursively with the following parameters:
q = str = "12"
ans = "1"
The method permutation is called recursively with the following parameters:
q = str = "2"
ans = "1 2"
The method permutation is called recursively with the following parameters:
q = str = ""
ans = "1 2 2"
The method permutation is called recursively with the following parameters:
q = str = ""
ans = "1 2 2 1"
