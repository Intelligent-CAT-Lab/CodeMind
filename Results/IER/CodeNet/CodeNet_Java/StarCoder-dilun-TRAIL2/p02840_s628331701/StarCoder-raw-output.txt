 variable n, variable x and variable d are initialized with 3, 4 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable grp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable grp by multiplying variable x with i. Then it calculates the value of variable offet by dividing variable grp by d and rounding down.
Then it calculates the value of variable grp by taking the remainder of variable grp after dividing it by d and adding d to it.
Then it checks if the current value of variable grp is already present in the hashmap segments. If it is not present, it adds a new entry to the hashmap with key as the current value of variable grp and value as an empty arraylist.
Then it gets the current value of the arraylist corresponding to the current value of variable grp from the hashmap segments.
Then it adds two new entries to the current value of the arraylist corresponding to the current value of variable grp from the hashmap segments.
The first entry has value as the sum of the expression (offet + i * (i - 1) / 2) and the second entry has value as the sum of the expression (offet + (2 * n - 1 - i) * i / 2).
Then it sorts the current value of the arraylist corresponding to the current value of variable grp from the hashmap segments based on the value of the entries.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the size of the current value of the arraylist corresponding to the current value of variable grp from the hashmap segments.
Inside the for loop, it gets the current entry e from the current value of the arraylist corresponding to the current value of variable grp from the hashmap segments.
Then it checks if the current value of variable cnt is 0 and the value of the current entry e is -1. If it is true, it sets the value of variable begin to the value of the current entry e.
Then it increments the value of variable cnt by 1.
Then it checks if the current value of variable cnt is 0. If it is true, it adds the value of the current entry e minus the value of variable begin plus 1 to the value of variable ans.
