e variable W, variable H and variable C are initialized with 10, 20 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the remainder of variable a divided by variable b is not 0.
If it is not 0, it assigns the value of variable a to variable c, and then it assigns the value of variable b to variable a.
Then it assigns the value of variable c to variable b.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the number of rectangles that can be formed by the given dimensions and the number of colors.
