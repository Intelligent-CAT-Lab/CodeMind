he variable X is initialized with 3 and variable Y is initialized with 20.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable X is less than or equal to the value of variable Y.
Inside the while loop, it doubles the value of variable X and increments the value of variable i by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable i as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        Long X = sc.nextLong();
        Long Y = sc.nextLong();

        int i=0;
        while(X<=Y){
            i++;
            X*=2;
        }

        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
