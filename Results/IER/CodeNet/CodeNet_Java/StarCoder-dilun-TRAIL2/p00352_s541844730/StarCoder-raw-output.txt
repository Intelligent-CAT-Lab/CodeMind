he variable sc is initialized with a Scanner object.
The Scanner object reads the input from the standard input and stores it in a variable named input.
The Scanner object then converts the input to an integer and stores it in a variable named num1.
The Scanner object then reads the input from the standard input and stores it in a variable named input.
The Scanner object then converts the input to an integer and stores it in a variable named num2.
The code then prints the average of num1 and num2 as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println(sc.nextInt()*sc.nextInt());
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
