he variable a, variable b, variable c, variable x and variable y are initialized with 1500, 2000, 1600, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmpPrice.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the total price of the current interger i by multiplying it with variable nc, adding the price of the first item with variable a and the maximum of 0 and the difference between variable x and variable i, adding the price of the second item with variable b and the maximum of 0 and the difference between variable y and variable i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable price as output, which is 1500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
