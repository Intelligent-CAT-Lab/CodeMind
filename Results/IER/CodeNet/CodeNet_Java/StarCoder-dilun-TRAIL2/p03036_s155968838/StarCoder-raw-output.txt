he variable r is initialized with 2, variable d is initialized with 10 and variable ary is initialized with 11 elements.
The first element of ary is initialized with the value of variable r.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ary[i + 1] by multiplying the value of ary[i] with variable r and subtracting variable d.
After the loop finishes, it print the values of ary[0], ary[1], ary[2], ary[3], ary[4], ary[5], ary[6], ary[7], ary[8] and ary[9] as output, which are 20, 10, 0, -8, -20, -38, -50, -58, -60 and -62.
<<<Output>>>
20
10
0
-8
-20
-38
-50
-58
-60
-62

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] ary = new int [n];
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
			ary[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max = ary[0];
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
			if(max < ary[i]){
				max = ary[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
