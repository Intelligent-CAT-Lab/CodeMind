he variable r is initialized with 2, variable d is initialized with 10 and variable ary is initialized with 11 elements.
The first element of ary is initialized with the value of variable r.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ary[i + 1] by multiplying the value of ary[i] with variable r and subtracting variable d.
After the loop finishes, it print the values of ary[0], ary[1], ary[2], ary[3], ary[4], ary[5], ary[6], ary[7], ary[8] and ary[9] as output, which are 20, 10, 0, -8, -20, -38, -50, -58, -60 and -62.
