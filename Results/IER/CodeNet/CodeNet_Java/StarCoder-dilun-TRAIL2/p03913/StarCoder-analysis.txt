he variable n is initialized with 8 and variable a is initialized with 1.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 40.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable c by taking the power of variable n with 1/m.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from the maximum of c-2 and 2 to the minimum of c+2 and 40.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable res by multiplying variable a with (m-1).
Then it calculates the value of variable den by taking the power of variable i with j and the power of variable i+1 with m-1-j.
Then it calculates the value of variable res by adding variable res with j*i+(m-1-j)*(i+1).
Then it calculates the value of variable res by adding variable res with (n+den-1)/den.
Then it updates the value of variable ans with the minimum of variable ans and variable res.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
