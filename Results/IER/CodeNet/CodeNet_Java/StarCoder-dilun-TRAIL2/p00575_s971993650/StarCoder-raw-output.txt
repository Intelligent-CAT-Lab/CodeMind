he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 3, 0 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if variable coins is less than variable c.
Inside the while loop, it increments variable day by 1. Then it increments variable coins by variable a.
Then it checks if the remainder of variable day divided by 7 is 0. If it is, it increments variable coins by variable b.
The condition is met when variable day is 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, 175, 182, 189, 196, 203, 210, 217, 224, 231, 238, 245, 252, 259, 266, 273, 280, 287, 294, 301, 308, 315, 322, 329, 336, 343, 350, 357, 364, 371, 378, 385, 392, 399, 406, 413, 420, 427, 434, 441, 448, 455, 462, 469, 476, 483, 490, 497, 504, 511, 518, 525, 532, 539, 546, 553, 560, 567, 574, 581,
