he variable N is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable a.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable result.
Inside the third for loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor of the current interger a and k.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Scanner sn = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sn.nextInt();
        int result = 0;
        int a = 0;

        for(int i=1; i<=N; i++){
            for(int j=1; j<=N; j++){
                a =gcd(i, j);
                for(int k=1; k<=N; k++){
                    result += gcd(a, k);
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(result);
    }

    public static int gcd(int p, int q){
        if(p % q == 0){
            return q;
        }
        return gcd(q, p%q);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1
