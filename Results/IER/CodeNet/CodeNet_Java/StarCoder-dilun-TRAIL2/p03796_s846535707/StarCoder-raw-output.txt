he variable N is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable total.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i with variable total and stores the result in variable total.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable total as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
    	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      	int N = sc.nextInt();
      	
      	long total = 1L;
      	for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++){
        	total = (total * i) % 1000000007;
        }
      	System.out.println(total);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable total.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i with variable total and stores the result in variable total.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable total as output, which is 3628800.
<<<Output>>>
3628800
