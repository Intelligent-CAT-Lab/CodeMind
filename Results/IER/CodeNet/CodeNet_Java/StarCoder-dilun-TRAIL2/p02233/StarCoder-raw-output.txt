he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the fibonacci number of the current interger n by calling the function fib(n).
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable n as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
