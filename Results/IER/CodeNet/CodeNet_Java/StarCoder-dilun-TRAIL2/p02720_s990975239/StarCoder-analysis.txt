variable k is initialized with 15.
It enters a while loop and it iterates k times.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable temp by calling the pollLast() method of the ArrayDeque object que.
Then it calculates the value of variable modTen by taking the modulus of variable temp with 10.
If the value of variable modTen is not 0, it adds the value of temp * 10 + modTen - 1 to the front of the ArrayDeque object que.
Then it adds the value of temp * 10 + modTen to the front of the ArrayDeque object que.
If the value of variable modTen is not 9, it adds the value of temp * 10 + modTen + 1 to the front of the ArrayDeque object que.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable temp as output, which is 123456789123456789.
