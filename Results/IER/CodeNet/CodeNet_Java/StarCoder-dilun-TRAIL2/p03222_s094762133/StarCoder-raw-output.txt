he variable h, variable w and variable k are initialized with 1, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable a is initialized with a 2-dimensional array of size h+1 x w+2. The first row of the array is filled with 1. The first column of the array is filled with 0. The first two elements of the second row of the array are filled with 1.
The variable f is initialized with a 1-dimensional array of size w+2. The first two elements of the array are filled with 1. The rest of the elements are calculated by the recurrence relation f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2].
The for loop iterates from 3 to w+2 to calculate the rest of the elements of the second row of the array a. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of the current element a[i][j] by using the recurrence relation a[i][j] = (f[j-1]*f[w-j+1]*a[i-1][j-1] + f[j]*f[w-j+1]*a[i-1][j] + f[j]*f[w-j]*a[i-1][j+1]) % mod.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of a[h][k] as output, which is 1.
