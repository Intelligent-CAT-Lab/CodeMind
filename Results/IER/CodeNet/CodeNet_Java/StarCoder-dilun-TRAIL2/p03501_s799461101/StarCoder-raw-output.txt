e variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 7, 17 and 120 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the product of N and A is less than B. If it is, it prints the product of N and A as output. Otherwise, it prints B as output.
<<<Output>>>
120
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int N = sc.nextInt();
    int A = sc.nextInt();
    int B = sc.nextInt();
    
    System.out.println(N*A > B? N*A : B);
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 17 120
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
