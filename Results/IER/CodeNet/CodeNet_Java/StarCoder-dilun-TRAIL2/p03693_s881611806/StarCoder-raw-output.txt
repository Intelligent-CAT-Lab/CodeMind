he variable r, g and b are initialized with 4, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable s is initialized with the concatenation of the string values of variables g and b.
The variable k is initialized with the integer value of variable s.
It checks if the value of variable k is divisible by 4. If it is, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
NO

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int c = sc.nextInt();

    int sum = a + b + c;
    int diff = a - b - c;
    int prod = a * b * c;

    if (sum == n) {
      System.out.println("YES");
    } else if (diff == n) {
      System.out.println("YES");
    } else if (prod == n) {
      System.out.println("YES");
    } else {
      System.out.println("NO");
    }
  }

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 1 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 10, 1, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variables sum, diff and prod are initialized with the sum, difference and product of variables a, b and c respectively.
It checks if the value of variable sum is equal to the value of variable n. If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
It checks if the value of variable diff is equal to the value of variable n. If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
It checks if the value of variable prod is equal to the value of variable n. If it is, it prints "YES" as
