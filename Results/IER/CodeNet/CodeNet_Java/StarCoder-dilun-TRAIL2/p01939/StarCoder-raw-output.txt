he variable first_N is initialized with 3 and variable first_M is initialized with 9.
It checks if first_N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of (first_M+1)%MOD.
Otherwise, it checks if (first_M+1)%(first_N-1) is equal to 0. If it is, it calculates the value of first_limit as (first_M+1)/(first_N-1)-1.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of first_limit as (first_M+1)/(first_N-1).
Then it checks if first_limit is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints the value of (first_M+1)%MOD.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of A as first_M+1, the value of B as 2*(first_M+1), the value of C as first_N-1 and the value of limit as first_limit.
Then it calculates the value of A as A+B-C.
Finally, it prints the value of A%MOD as output.

Consider the following code:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String args[]){

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int M = sc.nextInt();

		int limit;

		if(N == 1){
			System.out.println((M+1)%1000000007);
		}else{

			if((M+1)%(N-1) == 0){
				limit = (M+1)/(N-1)-1;
			}else{
				limit = (M+1)/(N-1);
			}

			if(limit <= 0){
				System.out.println((M+1)%1000000007);
			}else{

				int A = M+1;
				int B = 2*(M+1);
				B = B*limit;

				int C = N-1;
				C = C*limit;
