he variable first_N is initialized with 3 and variable first_M is initialized with 9.
It checks if first_N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of (first_M+1)%MOD.
Otherwise, it checks if (first_M+1)%(first_N-1) is equal to 0. If it is, it calculates the value of first_limit as (first_M+1)/(first_N-1)-1.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of first_limit as (first_M+1)/(first_N-1).
Then it checks if first_limit is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints the value of (first_M+1)%MOD.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of A as first_M+1, the value of B as 2*(first_M+1), the value of C as first_N-1 and the value of limit as first_limit.
Then it calculates the value of A as A+B-C.
Finally, it prints the value of A%MOD as output.
