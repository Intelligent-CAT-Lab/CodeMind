he variable A, variable B, variable C are initialized with 4, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable res is initialized with 0.
The variable res is calculated by dividing the product of A and B by 2.
Then it checks if the remainder of the division is 0. If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
If the remainder is not 0, it checks if the difference between C and B is less than A. If it is, it prints "NO" as output.
If the difference is not less than A, it prints "YES" as output.
