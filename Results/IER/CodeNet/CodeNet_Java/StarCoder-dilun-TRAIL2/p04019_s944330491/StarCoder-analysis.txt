he variable dir is initialized with 4 boolean values, which are all false.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string. The value of variable i is also passed to variable now.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character now is equal to 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W'. If it is, it sets the corresponding boolean value of variable dir to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the values of the boolean variables dir[0], dir[1], dir[2] and dir[3] are all the same. If they are, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
