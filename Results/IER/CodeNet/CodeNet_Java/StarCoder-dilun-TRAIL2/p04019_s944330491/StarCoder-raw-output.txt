he variable dir is initialized with 4 boolean values, which are all false.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string. The value of variable i is also passed to variable now.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character now is equal to 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W'. If it is, it sets the corresponding boolean value of variable dir to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the values of the boolean variables dir[0], dir[1], dir[2] and dir[3] are all the same. If they are, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		BufferedReader f = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);
		
		int n = Integer.parseInt(f.readLine());
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = Integer.parseInt(f.readLine());
		}
		int max = arr[0];
		for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			if(arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
		}
		System.out.println(max);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1
2
3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3.
The variable arr is initialized with n integers.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it reads the next line of input and converts it to an integer and stores
