 variable S is initialized with the input string "AtCoder".
The variable c is initialized with the character array of the string S.
The first character of the array c is checked to see if it is equal to 'A'. If it is not, the program prints "WA" and returns.
The for loop is entered and it iterates from 2 to the length of the array c minus 1. The variable i is initialized with the current index of the array c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the array c at index i is equal to 'C'. If it is, it increments the variable count by 1 and updates the variable index with the current index i.
After the for loop finishes, it checks if the variable count is equal to 1. If it is not, the program prints "WA" and returns.
The for loop is entered again and it iterates from 0 to the length of the array c. The variable i is initialized with the current index of the array c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current index i is equal to 0 or equal to the variable index. If it is, it skips the current iteration and continues to the next iteration.
If the current index i is not equal to 0 or equal to the variable index, it checks if the current character of the array c at index i is greater than or equal to 'A' and less than or equal to 'Z'. If it is, the program prints "WA" and returns.
After the for loop finishes, the program prints "AC" and returns.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[N];
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max = arr[0];
		int min = arr[0];
		for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
			if (arr[i] > max) {
				max = arr[i];
