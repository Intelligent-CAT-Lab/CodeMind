TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[]i){
		int n=Integer.parseInt(new Scanner(System.in).next());
		int a=1;
		int b=1;
		int c=0;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
			c=a+b;
			a=b;
			b=c;
		}
		System.out.println(c);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
The variable a is initialized with 1.
The variable b is initialized with 1.
The variable c is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 4.
Inside the for loop, variable c is calculated by adding the values of variables a and b.
The value of variable a is then assigned to variable b and the value of variable b is assigned to variable c.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable c as output, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
