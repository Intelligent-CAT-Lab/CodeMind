he variable data is initialized with an array of 3 integers.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to the index of the array data.
Inside the for loop, it reads the input from the user and stores it in the array data.
Then it sorts the array data in ascending order.
Then it calculates the absolute difference between the second and first elements of the array data and adds it to the variable sum.
Then it calculates the absolute difference between the second and third elements of the array data and adds it to the variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[]args){
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

      int[] data = new int[3];
      int sum = 0;
      for(int i =0;i<3;i++){
        data[i] = sc.nextInt();
      }

      Arrays.sort(data);

      sum = Math.abs(data[1]-data[0]);
      sum = sum + Math.abs(data[1]-data[2]);

      System.out.println(sum);

      }

  }

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
