he variable N is initialized with 111.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger N falls within the range [111, 1110, 1111, 1112, 1113, 1114, 1115, 1116, 1117, 1118]. If it does, it prints the fianl value of variable i + 1 as output, which is 112.
