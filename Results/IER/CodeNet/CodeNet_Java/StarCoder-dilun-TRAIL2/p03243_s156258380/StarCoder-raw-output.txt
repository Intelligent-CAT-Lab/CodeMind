he variable N is initialized with 111.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger N falls within the range [111, 1110, 1111, 1112, 1113, 1114, 1115, 1116, 1117, 1118]. If it does, it prints the fianl value of variable i + 1 as output, which is 112.
<<<Output>>>
112

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    static int N;
    static int THRESHOLD = 111;

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        N = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            if(N > THRESHOLD * i && N <= THRESHOLD * (i + 1)) {
                System.out.println(THRESHOLD * (i + 1));
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```111
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 111.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger N falls within the range [111, 1110, 1111, 1112, 1113, 1114, 1115, 1116, 1117, 1118]. If it does, it prints the
