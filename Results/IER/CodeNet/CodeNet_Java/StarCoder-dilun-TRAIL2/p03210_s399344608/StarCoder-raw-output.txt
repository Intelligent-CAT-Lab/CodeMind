he variable X is initialized with 5 according to the input.
The if statement checks if the value of variable X is equal to 3. If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
The else if statement checks if the value of variable X is equal to 5. If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
The else if statement checks if the value of variable X is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
The else statement prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
NO

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int X = sc.nextInt();

        if(X==3){
            System.out.println("YES");
        }
        else if(X==5){
            System.out.println("YES");
        }
        else if(X==7){
            System.out.println("YES");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("NO");
        }

    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 3 according to the input.
The if statement checks if the value of variable X is equal to 3. If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
The else if statement checks if the value of variable X is equal to 5. If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
The else if statement checks if the value of variable X is equal to 7. If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
The else statement prints "NO" as output.
