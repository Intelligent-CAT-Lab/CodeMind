he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 4, 12 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a, b and c are all even or odd. If they are all even, it prints -1 and returns.
Otherwise, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1_000_000_000.
Inside the for loop, it checks if a, b and c are all odd. If they are all odd, it prints the current value of i and returns.
Otherwise, it calculates the new values of a, b and c by dividing them by 2.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of i as output.
