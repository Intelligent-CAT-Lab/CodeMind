he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 4, 12 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a, b and c are all even or odd. If they are all even, it prints -1 and returns.
Otherwise, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1_000_000_000.
Inside the for loop, it checks if a, b and c are all odd. If they are all odd, it prints the current value of i and returns.
Otherwise, it calculates the new values of a, b and c by dividing them by 2.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of i as output.
<<<Output>>>
1000000000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        
        int ans = 0;
        
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            int x = sc.nextInt();
            if(x%a==0 && x%b==0 && x%c==0){
                ans++;
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 5, 2, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It initializes variable ans with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it reads an integer x from the input and checks if x is divisible by a, b and c
