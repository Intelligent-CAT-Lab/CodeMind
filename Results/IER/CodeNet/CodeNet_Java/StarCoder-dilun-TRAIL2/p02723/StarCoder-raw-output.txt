he variable s is initialized with the input string.
It checks if the characters at positions 2, 3, 4 and 5 are equal. If they are, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    String s = sc.next();
    
    if(s.charAt(0)==s.charAt(1) && s.charAt(2) == s.charAt(3))
      System.out.println("Yes");
    else
      System.out.println("No");
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```sippuu
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
