e variable n is initialized with 4 and variable m is initialized with 1.
The code enters a while loop and it checks if the difference between i and j is less than n/2.
Inside the while loop, it prints the values of i and j as output.
The value of i is decremented by 1 and the value of j is incremented by 1.
The value of m is decremented by 1.
The while loop is exited when the value of m is 0.
