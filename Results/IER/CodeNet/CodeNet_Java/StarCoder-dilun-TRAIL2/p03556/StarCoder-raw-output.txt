he variable r is initialized with the square root of the input.
The code then prints the square of the variable r as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {
			execute(scanner);
		}
	}

	private static void execute(Scanner scanner) {
		int n = scanner.nextInt();
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
			sum += i;
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 55.
<<<Output>>>
55
