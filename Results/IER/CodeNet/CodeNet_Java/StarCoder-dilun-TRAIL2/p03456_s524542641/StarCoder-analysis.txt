he variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 21 respectively according to the input.
The variable aa and variable bb are initialized with the length of the string value of a and b respectively.
The if statement checks if the length of a and b are 1 or 2 or 3.
If the length of a and b are 1 or 2 or 3, the variable c is initialized with 10*a+b.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to c-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the square of the current interger num by repeatedlly multiplying it with itself.
Then it checks if the calculated variable num is equal to the variable c. If it is, it prints "Yes" and breaks the loop.
If the calculated variable num is not equal to the variable c, it prints "No" and breaks the loop.
