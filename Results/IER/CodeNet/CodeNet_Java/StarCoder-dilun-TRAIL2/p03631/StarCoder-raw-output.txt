he variable a is initialized with 575 according to the input.
Then it calculates the values of variables a100, a10 and a1 by dividing a by 100, 10 and 1 respectively.
Then it calculates the value of variable rev by multiplying a1 by 100, a10 by 10 and a100 by 1 respectively.
Then it checks if the calculated variable rev is equal to a. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to "Yes". Otherwise, it sets the value of variable ans to "No".
After the if statement, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args){
    	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    	// 入力
    	int a = sc.nextInt();
    	int b = sc.nextInt();
    	int c = sc.nextInt();

    	int a100 = a/100;
    	int a10 = a/10 - a100*10;
    	int a1 = a - a100*100 - a10*10;
    	int b100 = b/100;
    	int b10 = b/10 - b100*10;
    	int b1 = b - b100*100 - b10*10;
    	int c100 = c/100;
    	int c10 = c/10 - c100*10;
    	int c1 = c - c100*100 - c10*10;

    	int ans = 0;

    	if (a100 == b100 && a100 == c100){
    		ans = a100*1000 + a10*100 + a1*10 + b1*1;
    	} else if (a100 == b100){
    		ans = a100*1
