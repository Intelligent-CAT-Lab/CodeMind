he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable t.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to i to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable t.
Inside the inner for loop, it enters a while loop and it checks if the current interger t is divisible by j. If it is, it increments the value of x[j] by 1.
After the inner for loop finishes, it checks if the value of x[i] is greater than 0. If it is, it multiplies the current value of sum by (x[i]+1) and stores the result in variable sum.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		int[] x=new int[1001];
		long sum=1;
		for(int i=2;i<=n;i++){
			int t = i;
			for(int j=2;j<=i;j++){
				while(t%j==0){
					x[j]++;
					t/=j;
				}
			}
		}
		long e=(int)1e9+7;
		for(int i=0;i<1001;i++){
			if(x[i]>0){
				sum*=(x[i]+1);
				sum%=e;
			}	
		}
		System.out.print(sum);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
