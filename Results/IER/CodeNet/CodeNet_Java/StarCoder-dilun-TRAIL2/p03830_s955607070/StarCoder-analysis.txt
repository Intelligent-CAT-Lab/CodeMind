he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable t.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to i to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable t.
Inside the inner for loop, it enters a while loop and it checks if the current interger t is divisible by j. If it is, it increments the value of x[j] by 1.
After the inner for loop finishes, it checks if the value of x[i] is greater than 0. If it is, it multiplies the current value of sum by (x[i]+1) and stores the result in variable sum.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
