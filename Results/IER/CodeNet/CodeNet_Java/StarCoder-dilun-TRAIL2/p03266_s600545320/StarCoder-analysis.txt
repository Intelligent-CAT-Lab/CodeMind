he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2.
The value of variable k is checked to be even or odd. If it is even, the value of variable n is divided by the value of variable k to get the value of variable x.
Then the value of variable x is multiplied by the value of variable x to get the value of variable count.
Then the value of variable n is added by the value of variable k divided by 2 to get the value of variable y.
Then the value of variable y is multiplied by the value of variable y to get the value of variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 12.
