he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2.
The value of variable k is checked to be even or odd. If it is even, the value of variable n is divided by the value of variable k to get the value of variable x.
Then the value of variable x is multiplied by the value of variable x to get the value of variable count.
Then the value of variable n is added by the value of variable k divided by 2 to get the value of variable y.
Then the value of variable y is multiplied by the value of variable y to get the value of variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		long count = 0;
		if (k % 2 == 0) {
			long x = n / k;
			count += (x * x * x);
			long y = (n + k / 2) / k;
			count += (y * y * y);
		} else {
			long x = n / k;
			count += (x * x * x);
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 3.
The value of variable k is checked to be even or odd. If it is even, the value of variable n is divided by the value of variable k to get the value of variable x.
Then the value of variable x is multiplied by the value of variable x to get the value of variable count.
Then the value of variable n is added by the value of variable k divided by
