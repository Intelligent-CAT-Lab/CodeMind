he variable num is initialized with an empty arraylist.
The variable param is initialized with an empty arraylist.
The variable system is initialized with 0.
The code enters a while loop and it keeps reading the input from the user until the user enters a blank line.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the user entered an integer. If it does, it adds the integer to the variable num.
If the user entered a string, it checks if the variable system is 0. If it is, it adds the string to the variable param.
If the variable system is 1, it adds the string to the variable param.
After the while loop finishes, it sorts the variable num in ascending order.
Then it prints the first two elements of the variable num as output, which is 600 and 700.
