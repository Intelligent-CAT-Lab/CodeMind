he variable N, variable X and variable T are initialized with 20, 12 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if N is divisible by X. If it is, it calculates the number of times X can be divided by N and multiplies it with T to get the final output.
If N is not divisible by X, it calculates the number of times X can be divided by N and multiplies it with T to get the final output plus T to get the final output.
