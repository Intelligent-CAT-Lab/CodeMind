he variable N, variable X and variable T are initialized with 20, 12 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if N is divisible by X. If it is, it calculates the number of times X can be divided by N and multiplies it with T to get the final output.
If N is not divisible by X, it calculates the number of times X can be divided by N and multiplies it with T to get the final output plus T to get the final output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
                Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

                int N = scan.nextInt();
                int X = scan.nextInt();
                int T = scan.nextInt();

                if (N%X == 0) {
                	System.out.println(N/X * T);
                } else {
                	System.out.println(N/X * T + T);
                }

                scan.close();

        }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 12 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
