e variable s is initialized with 010.
The variable n is initialized with the length of the string s.
The variable ans is initialized with n - 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the characters at position i and i + 1 are different. If they are, it calculates the maximum of i + 1 and n - i - 2 and assigns it to variable tmp.
Then it checks if the calculated variable tmp is less than the current value of variable ans. If it is, it assigns the calculated variable tmp to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		sc.close();
		int ans = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
			for(int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
				if(arr[i] > arr[j]) {
					ans++;
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of size n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check
