he variable str is initialized with the input.
The variable pattern is initialized with the regular expression "A?KIHA?BA?RA?$" which is a combination of the following three regular expressions:
A? : 0 or 1 occurrence of the character A
KIHA? : 0 or 1 occurrence of the string KIHA
BA? : 0 or 1 occurrence of the string BA
RA? : 0 or 1 occurrence of the string RA
The method Pattern.matches(pattern,str) checks if the string str matches the regular expression pattern.
If the string str matches the regular expression pattern, it prints "YES" as output.
If the string str does not match the regular expression pattern, it prints "NO" as output.
