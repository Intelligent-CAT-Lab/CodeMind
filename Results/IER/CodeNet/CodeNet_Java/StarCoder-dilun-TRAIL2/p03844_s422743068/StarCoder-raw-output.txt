he variable a is initialized with 1 and variable b is initialized with 2.
The variable op is initialized with the string "+" and it is compared with the string "+" using the method equals.
If the comparison is true, it prints the sum of a and b as output, which is 3.
If the comparison is false, it prints the difference of a and b as output, which is -1.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		int d = sc.nextInt();
		int e = sc.nextInt();
		int f = sc.nextInt();
		int g = sc.nextInt();
		int h = sc.nextInt();
		int i = sc.nextInt();
		int j = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		int l = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int o = sc.nextInt();
		int p = sc.nextInt();
		int q = sc.nextInt();
		int r = sc.nextInt();
		int s = sc.nextInt();
		int t = sc.nextInt();
		int u = sc.nextInt();
		int v = sc.nextInt();
		int w = sc.nextInt();
		int x = sc.nextInt();
		int y = sc.nextInt();
		int z = sc.nextInt();
		int sum = a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k+l+m+n+o+p+q+r+s+t+u+v+w+x+y+z;
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}
