ariable n, variable h and variable d are initialized with 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable dp is initialized with an array of length h+1. The first element of dp is initialized with 1.
The variable fs is initialized with 0. The variable f is initialized with 1.
The for loop iterates from 1 to n to calculate the value of variable f and variable fs.
The for loop iterates from 1 to h to calculate the value of variable sum.
The for loop iterates from 1 to d to calculate the value of variable ret.
