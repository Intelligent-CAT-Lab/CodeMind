he variable list is initialized with {2, 5, 4} according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until list[2]<=52.
Inside the while loop, it checks if list[0]==list[2]&&list[0]==list[1]. If it does, it breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is not met, it increments variable times by 1.
Then it checks if list[1]!=list[2]. If it does, it increments list[0] by 1 and list[1] by 1.
If the condition is not met, it increments list[0] by 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable times as output, which is 2.
