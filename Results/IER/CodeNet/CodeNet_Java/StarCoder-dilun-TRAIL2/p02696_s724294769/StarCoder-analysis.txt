he variable a, variable b and variable n are initialized with 5, 7 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable x is initialized with the minimum of b-1 and n.
The variable up is initialized with the value of a*(x%b)-(a%b)*(x%b)%b.
The value of variable up is divided by b to get the final output.
