he variable a, variable b and variable n are initialized with 5, 7 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable x is initialized with the minimum of b-1 and n.
The variable up is initialized with the value of a*(x%b)-(a%b)*(x%b)%b.
The value of variable up is divided by b to get the final output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    static PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);
    static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    static BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    long[] res;
    ArrayList<Integer>[] tree;
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Main main = new Main();
//        main.solve();
        out.println(main.solve());
        out.flush();
    }
    long solve(){
        long a = sc.nextLong(), b = sc.nextLong(), n = sc.nextLong();
        long x = Math.min(b-1,n);
        long up = a*(x%b)-(a%b)*(x%b)%b;
        return up/b;
    }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
