he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with the input.
It checks if the last character of variable a is equal to the first character of variable b and if the last character of variable b is equal to the first character of variable c.
If both conditions are met, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        int sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int num = sc.nextInt();

            if (num >= a && num <= b) {
                sum += num;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger num falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4 and 5.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
