he variable abc is initialized with 3 integers.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable abc[i].
Inside the for loop, it reads 3 integers from the input and stores them in the array abc.
Then it checks if the condition abc[0] < abc[1] && abc[1] < abc[2] is met. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
