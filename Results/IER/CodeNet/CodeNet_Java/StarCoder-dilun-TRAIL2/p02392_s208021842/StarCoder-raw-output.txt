he variable abc is initialized with 3 integers.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable abc[i].
Inside the for loop, it reads 3 integers from the input and stores them in the array abc.
Then it checks if the condition abc[0] < abc[1] && abc[1] < abc[2] is met. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Main2 cc = new Main2();
        cc.yesNo();
    }
}

class Main2{
    public void yesNo(){
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int[] abc = new int[3];
        for(int i=0; i < 3; i++){
            abc[i] = scan.nextInt();
        }
        if(abc[0] < abc[1] && abc[1] < abc[2]){
            System.out.println("Yes");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 8
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
