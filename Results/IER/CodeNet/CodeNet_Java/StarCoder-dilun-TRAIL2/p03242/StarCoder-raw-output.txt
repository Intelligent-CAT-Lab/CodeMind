e variable S is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string S is '1'. If it is, it changes the character to '9'. Otherwise, it changes the character to '1'.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable S as output, which is 991.
<<<Output>>>
991

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int N = sc.nextInt();
    int[] A = new int[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) A[i] = sc.nextInt();
    int[] B = new int[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) B[i] = sc.nextInt();
    int[] C = new int[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) System.out.print(C[i] + " ");
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
