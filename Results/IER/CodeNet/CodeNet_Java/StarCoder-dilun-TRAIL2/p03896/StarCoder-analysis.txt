e variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans[i][j] by checking the conditions.
The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3,4,5 and 6.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
