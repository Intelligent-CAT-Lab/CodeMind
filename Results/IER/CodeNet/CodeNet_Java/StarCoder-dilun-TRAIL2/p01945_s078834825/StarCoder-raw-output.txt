he variable str is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string str.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is "(" or ")". If it is, it increments or decrements the value of variable now.
If the current character is neither "(" nor ")", it assigns the value of variable now to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

		String str[] = br.readLine().split("");

		int ans=0;
		int now=0;
		
		for (int i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
			if (str[i].equals("(")) {
				now++;
			} else if (str[i].equals(")")) {
				now--;
			} else {
				ans=now;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```((*)())
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
