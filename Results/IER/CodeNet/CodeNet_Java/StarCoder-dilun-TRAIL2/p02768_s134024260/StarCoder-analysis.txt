variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with the value of 2^n - 1.
The variable comb is initialized with the value of combination(n, a).
The value of variable ans is subtracted by the value of variable comb.
The value of variable ans is subtracted by the value of combination(n, b).
The value of variable ans is printed as output.
