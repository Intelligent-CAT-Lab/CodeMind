 variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with the value of 2^n - 1.
The variable comb is initialized with the value of combination(n, a).
The value of variable ans is subtracted by the value of variable comb.
The value of variable ans is subtracted by the value of combination(n, b).
The value of variable ans is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
				if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
					int temp = arr[i];
					arr[i] = arr[j];
					arr[j] = temp;
				}
			}
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			if (arr[i] > max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max);
		sc.close();
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
An array of size n is created and initialized with 0.
A for loop is entered and it iterates from 0 to n - 1.
Inside the for loop, a for loop is
