he variable s is initialized with the input string.
The variable A is initialized with the index of the first occurrence of character 'A' in the string s.
The variable Z is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index j of the string s is equal to 'Z'. If it is, it updates the value of variable Z to j.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable Z - A + 1 as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
