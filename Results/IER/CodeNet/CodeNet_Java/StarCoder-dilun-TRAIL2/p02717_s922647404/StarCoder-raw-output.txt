he variable X, variable Y and variable Z are initialized with 1, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It prints the values of variables Z, X and Y in that order as output.
<<<Output>>>
3 1 2
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int X = sc.nextInt();
		int Y = sc.nextInt();
		int Z = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(Z + " " + X + " " + Y);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
