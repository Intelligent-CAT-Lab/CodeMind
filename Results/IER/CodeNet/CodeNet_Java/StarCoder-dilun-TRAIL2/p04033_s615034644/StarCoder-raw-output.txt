he variable a is initialized with 1 and variable b is initialized with 3.
The code checks if a * b is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Zero" and returns.
Then it checks if a is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "Positive" and returns.
Then it checks if (b - a) is odd. If it is, it prints "Positive" and returns.
Otherwise, it prints "Negative" and returns.
<<<Output>>>
Positive

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);) {
            new Main().solve(sc);
        }
    }

    void solve(Scanner sc) {
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        if (a == 0) {
            System.out.println("Zero");
            return;
        }

        if (a > 0) {
            System.out.println("Positive");
            return;
        }

        if (b % 2 == 1) {
            System.out.println("Positive");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Negative");
        }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1 and variable a is initialized with 3.
The code checks if a is equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Zero" and returns.
Then it checks if a is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "Positive" and returns.
Then it checks if b is odd. If it is, it prints "Positive" and returns.
Otherwise, it prints "Negative" and returns.
<<<Output>>>
Negative
