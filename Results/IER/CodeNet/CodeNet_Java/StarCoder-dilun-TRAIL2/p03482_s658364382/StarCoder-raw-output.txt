e variable N is initialized with the length of the input string S.
The variable center is initialized with the character at the center of the string S.
The variable length is initialized with 2.
The variable left is initialized with N/2-2.
The variable right is initialized with N/2+1.
The variable length is incremented by 2.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the character at the left and the right of the center are the same as the center.
If they are, the variable left is decremented by 1 and the variable right is incremented by 1.
The variable length is incremented by 2.
The while loop is repeated until the while condition is not met.
The variable length is decremented by 2.
The variable length is divided by 2.
The variable length is subtracted from N.
The final value of variable length is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String S = sc.next();
        int N = S.length();
        int[] dp = new int[N+1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;
        for(int i=2;i<=N;i++){
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
        }
        System.out.println(dp[N]);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the length of the input string S.
The variable dp is initialized with an array of length N+1.
The variable dp[0] is initialized with 0.
The variable dp[1] is initialized with 1.
The for loop is entered and it iterates from
