e variable N is initialized with the length of the input string S.
The variable center is initialized with the character at the center of the string S.
The variable length is initialized with 2.
The variable left is initialized with N/2-2.
The variable right is initialized with N/2+1.
The variable length is incremented by 2.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the character at the left and the right of the center are the same as the center.
If they are, the variable left is decremented by 1 and the variable right is incremented by 1.
The variable length is incremented by 2.
The while loop is repeated until the while condition is not met.
The variable length is decremented by 2.
The variable length is divided by 2.
The variable length is subtracted from N.
The final value of variable length is printed as output.
