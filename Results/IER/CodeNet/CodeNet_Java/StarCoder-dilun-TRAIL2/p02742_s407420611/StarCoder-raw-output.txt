e variable H and variable W are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if H or W is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 and returns.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable h by dividing H by 2.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to W to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int K = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        int[] arr = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            arr[i] = i + 1;
        }

        int[] dp = new int[N + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = K; j >= 1; j--) {
                if (i - j >= 0) {
                    dp[i + 1] += dp[i - j];
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(dp[N]);

    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on
