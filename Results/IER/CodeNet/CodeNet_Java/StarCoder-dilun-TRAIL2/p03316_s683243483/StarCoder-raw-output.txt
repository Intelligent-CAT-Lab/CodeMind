he variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input.
It converts the integer n to a string strn.
It calculates the length of the string strn and stores it in variable len.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to len-1 to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to the substring method of string strn.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current character i by converting it to an integer and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the integer n is divisible by the calculated variable sum. If it is, it sets the string ans to "Yes". Otherwise, it sets the string ans to "No".
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n;

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        n = sc.nextInt();

        String strn = String.valueOf(n);
        int len = strn.length();

        String ans;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            sum += Integer.parseInt(strn.substring(i, i + 1));
        }
        if (n % sum == 0) ans = "Yes";
        else ans = "No";

        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```123
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 123 according to the input.
It converts the integer n to a string strn.
It calculates the length of the string strn and stores it in variable len.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to len-1 to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to the substring method of string strn.
