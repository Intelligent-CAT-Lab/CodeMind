he variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input.
It converts the integer n to a string strn.
It calculates the length of the string strn and stores it in variable len.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to len-1 to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to the substring method of string strn.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current character i by converting it to an integer and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the integer n is divisible by the calculated variable sum. If it is, it sets the string ans to "Yes". Otherwise, it sets the string ans to "No".
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is "Yes".
