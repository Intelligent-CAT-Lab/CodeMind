he variable a is initialized with 4 according to the input.
The value of variable a is passed to the function main() and it is multiplied by itself and multiplied by 3.
The final value of variable a is printed as output, which is 48.
<<<Output>>>
48

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a*a*a);
    }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
