he variable N is initialized with 3 and variable M is initialized with 14.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of variable M. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of variable M. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable x. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,6,14.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x.ceiling(N) as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String args[]) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int M = sc.nextInt();

		int count = 0;
		for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
			for (int j = 1; j <= M; j++) {
				if (i % j == 0) {
					count++;
				}
			}
		}

		System.out.println(count);

	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10 and variable M is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to variable N. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to variable M. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of variable j. If it is, it increments variable count by 1. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,
