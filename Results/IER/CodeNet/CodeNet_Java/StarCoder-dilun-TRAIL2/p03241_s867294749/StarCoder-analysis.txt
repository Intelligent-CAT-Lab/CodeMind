he variable N is initialized with 3 and variable M is initialized with 14.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of variable M. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of variable M. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable x. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,6,14.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x.ceiling(N) as output, which is 3.
