he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i+1 to n to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable num.
Inside the third for loop, it checks if the current interger i and j have the same bit at position k. If it does not, it prints the value of k+1 as output.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 2.
