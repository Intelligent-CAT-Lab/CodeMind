he variable x and variable y are initialized with 54 and 20 respectively according to the input.
The method gcd is called with the values of x and y as parameters.
Inside the method gcd, it checks if the value of y is 0. If it is, it returns the value of x.
If the value of y is not 0, it calls the method gcd with the values of y and x mod y as parameters.
The method gcd is called again with the values of x mod y and y as parameters.
Inside the method gcd, it checks if the value of y is 0. If it is, it returns the value of x mod y.
If the value of y is not 0, it calls the method gcd with the values of y and x mod y as parameters.
The method gcd is called again with the values of x mod y and y as parameters.
Inside the method gcd, it checks if the value of y is 0. If it is, it returns the value of x mod y.
If the value of y is not 0, it calls the method gcd with the values of y and x mod y as parameters.
The method gcd is called again with the values of x mod y and y as parameters.
Inside the method gcd, it checks if the value of y is 0. If it is, it returns the value of x mod y.
If the value of y is not 0, it calls the method gcd with the values of y and x mod y as parameters.
