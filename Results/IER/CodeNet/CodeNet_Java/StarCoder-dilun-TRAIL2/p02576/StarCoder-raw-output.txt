he variable n, variable x and variable t are initialized with 20, 12 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates while variable n is greater than variable tako.
Inside the while loop, it adds variable t to variable ans and adds variable x to variable tako.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 144.
<<<Output>>>
144

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n, x, t;
        n = sc.nextInt();
        x = sc.nextInt();
        t = sc.nextInt();
        long ans = 0, tako = 0;
        while (n > tako) {
            ans += t;
            tako += x;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
        sc.close();
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 12 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
