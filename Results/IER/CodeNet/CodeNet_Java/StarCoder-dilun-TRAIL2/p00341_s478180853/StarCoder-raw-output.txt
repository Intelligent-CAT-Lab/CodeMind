he variable e is initialized with an array of 13 elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 12 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 12 - i to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable k.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current interger e[j] is less than the next interger e[j + 1]. If it is, it swaps the values of e[j] and e[j + 1].
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer u in this range. The value of variable u is also passed to variable i.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable i.
Inside the third for loop, it checks if the current interger e[i] is equal to the next interger e[i + 1] and the next interger e[i + 2] and the next interger e[i + 3]. If it is, it adds 1 to variable p.
After the third for loop finishes, it checks if the current interger e[i] is equal to the next interger e[i + 1] and the next interger e[i + 2] and the next interger e[i + 3]. If it is, it adds 1 to variable p.
After the third for loop finishes, it checks if the current interger e[i] is equal to the next interger e[i + 1] and the next interger e[i + 2] and the next interger e[i + 3]. If it is, it adds 1 to variable p.
After the third for loop finishes, it checks if the current interger e[i] is equal to the next interger e[i + 1] and the next interger e[i + 2] and the next interger e[i + 3]. If it is, it adds
