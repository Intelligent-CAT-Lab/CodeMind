he variable a is initialized with 8 and variable b is initialized with 13.
The function solve(a, b) is called with the values of a and b as parameters.
The function returns the value of (b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2 - b.
The value of (b - a + 1) is 8 and the value of (b - a) is 5.
The value of (b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2 is 40 and the value of b is 13.
The value of (b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2 - b is 37.
The value of the function solve(a, b) is 37.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        System.out.println(solve(a, b));

        sc.close();
    }

    static int solve(int a, int b) {
        int sum = 0;

        for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                sum += i;
            }
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 1 and variable b is initialized with 10.
The function solve(a, b) is called with the values of a and b as parameters.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from a to b and checks if i is even. If it is, it adds i to variable sum.
The value of the function solve(a, b) is the sum of all even numbers between a and b.
<<<Output>>>
25
