he variable a is initialized with 8 and variable b is initialized with 13.
The function solve(a, b) is called with the values of a and b as parameters.
The function returns the value of (b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2 - b.
The value of (b - a + 1) is 8 and the value of (b - a) is 5.
The value of (b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2 is 40 and the value of b is 13.
The value of (b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2 - b is 37.
The value of the function solve(a, b) is 37.
