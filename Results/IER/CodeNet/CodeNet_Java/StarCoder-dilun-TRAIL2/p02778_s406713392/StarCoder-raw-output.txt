he variable S is initialized with the string sardine. The variable Length is initialized with the length of the string S.
The variable tmp is initialized with an array of length Length.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to Length-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it assigns the character 'x' to the current interger i in the array tmp.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of array tmp as output, which is ['x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x'].
<<<Output>>>
['x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x','x']

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int arr[] = new int[N];
		for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
			arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
		}
		int sum=0;
		for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
			sum+=arr[i];
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the integer 5. The variable arr is initialized with an array of length N.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr.
Inside the for loop, it reads an integer from the
