 variable s is initialized with the input string "BBBWW".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to s.length - 1 to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character i is not equal to the previous character j. If it is not, it increments variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
