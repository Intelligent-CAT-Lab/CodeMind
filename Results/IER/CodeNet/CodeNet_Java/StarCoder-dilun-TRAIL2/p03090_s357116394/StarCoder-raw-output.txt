he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i+1 to n to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the sum of i and j is equal to n. If it does, it skips the current iteration of the second for loop and goes to the next iteration of the first for loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
		int count = 0;
		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
		    for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
		        if (n % 2 == 0) {
		            if (i + j == n + 1) {
		                continue;
		            }
		        } else {
		            if (i + j == n) {
		                continue;
		            }
		        }
		        sb.append(i).append(" ").append(j).append("\n");
		        count++;
		    }
		}
		System.out.println(count);
		System.out.print(sb);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is
