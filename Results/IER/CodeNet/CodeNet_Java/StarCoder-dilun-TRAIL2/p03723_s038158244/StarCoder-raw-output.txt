 variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 4, 12 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1000000000 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the average of the three integers a, b and c by dividing them by 2.
Then it checks if the calculated averages are equal to each other. If they are, it prints -1 as output.
If they are not equal, it checks if the averages are odd. If they are, it prints the current interger i as output.
If they are not odd, it sets the variable ebishu to false and prints the current interger i as output.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the variable ebishu is true. If it is, it prints -1 as output.
If it is not true, it prints the final value of variable i as output.
<<<Output>>>
