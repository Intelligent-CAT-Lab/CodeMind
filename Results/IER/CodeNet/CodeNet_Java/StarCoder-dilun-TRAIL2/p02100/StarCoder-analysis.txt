NO-ANSWER
e variable arr is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character c in the array arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character c is '+'. If it is, it sets the value of variable plus to true.
Then it checks if the character c is '-'. If it is, it sets the value of variable plus to false.
Then it checks if the character c is '^'. If it is, it sets the value of variable si to true.
Then it checks if the character c is 'x'. If it is, it sets the value of variable xs to true.
Then it checks if the value of variable si is true. If it is, it calculates the value of variable v by subtracting the ASCII value of character c from 48.
Then it checks if the value of variable plus is true. If it is, it adds the value of variable num to the value of variable v.
Then it checks if the value of variable plus is false. If it is, it subtracts the value of variable num from the value of variable v.
Then it checks if the value of variable xs is true. If it is, it checks if the value of variable num is 0. If it is, it sets the value of variable num to 1.
Then it checks if the value of variable si is false. If it is, it multiplies the value of variable num by 10 and adds the value of variable c subtracted from 48 to it.
Then it checks if the value of variable plus is true. If it is, it adds the value of variable num to the value of variable v.
