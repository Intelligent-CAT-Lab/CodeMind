he variable a is initialized with 12.
The variable b is initialized with 12-12.
The variable c is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 12-12 to 12/2.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable c by adding the value of variable c with the value of (a/2)/df(i+1).
The value of variable c is 12/2.
The value of variable c is multiplied by ((a+1)%2).
The value of variable c is 12/2*1.
The value of variable c is 6.
