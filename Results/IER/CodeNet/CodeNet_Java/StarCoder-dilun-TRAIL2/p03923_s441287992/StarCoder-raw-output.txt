e variable n is initialized with 8 and variable a is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 40 to check each integer take in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable lo and variable hi.
The value of variable lo is 2 and the value of variable hi is n.
Then it enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable lo is less than or equal to the value of variable hi.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable mid by adding the value of variable lo and the value of variable hi and dividing it by 2.
Then it checks if the value of variable mid to the power of take + 1 is less than or equal to the value of variable n.
If it is, it sets the value of variable lo to the value of variable mid + 1.
Otherwise, it sets the value of variable hi to the value of variable mid.
After the while loop finishes, it calculates the value of variable same by subtracting the value of variable lo by 1.
Then it calculates the value of variable total by initializing it with 1 and then it repeatedly multiplies it by the value of variable same.
Then it enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable total is less than or equal to the value of variable n.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable total by dividing it by the value of variable same.
Then it multiplies it by the value of variable same + 1.
Then it increments the value of variable tmp by 1.
After the while loop finishes, it sets the value of variable ans to the minimum of the value of variable ans and the value of variable tmp.
After the for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
