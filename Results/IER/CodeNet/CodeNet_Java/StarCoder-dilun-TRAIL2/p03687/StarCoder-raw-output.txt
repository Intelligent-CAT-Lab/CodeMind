he variable s is initialized with the input string "serval".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25 to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable target.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s to check each character j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable cur.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the character at index j of the string s is equal to the character target. If it is, it sets the value of variable cur to 0.
Otherwise, it increments the value of variable cur by 1.
Then it checks if the current value of variable cur is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, it sets the value of variable max to the current value of variable cur.
After the second for loop finishes, it checks if the current value of variable max is less than the current value of variable ans. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to the current value of variable max.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int ans = 0;
		for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
			for(int j=i+1; j<n; j++){
				if(arr[i] > arr[j]){
					int temp = arr[i];
					arr[i] = arr[j];
					arr[j] = temp;
				}
			}
		}
		for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
			ans += arr[i];
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
		return;
	}
