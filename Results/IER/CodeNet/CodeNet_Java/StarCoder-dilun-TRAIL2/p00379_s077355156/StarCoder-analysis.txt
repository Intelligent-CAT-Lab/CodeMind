e variable a is initialized with 16, variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is initialized with 1000.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from a + a == 0? 1 : 0 to m. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num2.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable y by calling the Dudeney function.
Then it calculates the value of variable x by raising the value of y to the power of n.
Then it checks if the calculated value of variable x is equal to the value of variable num2. If it is, it increments the value of variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
