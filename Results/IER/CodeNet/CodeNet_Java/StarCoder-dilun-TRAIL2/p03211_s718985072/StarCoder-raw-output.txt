e variable str is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string str minus 2. The value of variable i is also passed to variable split.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the absolute value of 753 minus the current interger split.
Then it checks if the calculated value of variable abs is less than the current value of variable ans. If it is, it updates the value of variable ans with the calculated value of variable abs.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
