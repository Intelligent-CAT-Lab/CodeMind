he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2.
The value of variable ans is calculated by the following formula:
```
ans = (n / k) * (n / k) * (n / k)
```
The value of variable n is incremented by k / 2.
The value of variable ans is incremented by the following formula:
```
ans += (n / k) * (n / k) * (n / k)
```
The final value of variable ans is printed as output.
