he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2.
The value of variable ans is calculated by the following formula:
```
ans = (n / k) * (n / k) * (n / k)
```
The value of variable n is incremented by k / 2.
The value of variable ans is incremented by the following formula:
```
ans += (n / k) * (n / k) * (n / k)
```
The final value of variable ans is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		int ans = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			int x = sc.nextInt();
			if (x % k == 0) {
				ans++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 and variable k is initialized with 2.
The value of variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger x is divisible by k. If it is, it increments the value of variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
