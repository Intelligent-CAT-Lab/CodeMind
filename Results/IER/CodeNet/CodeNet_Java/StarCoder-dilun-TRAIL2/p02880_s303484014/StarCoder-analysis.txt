e variable N is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i * j equals to N. If it does, it prints "Yes" and returns. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9.
After the loop finishes, it prints "No" as output.
