he variable strNum is initialized with the input. Then it is split into a list of strings by the space character.
Then the list is sorted in ascending order.
Then the first, middle and last elements of the list are converted to integers and assigned to variables intNumSmall, intNumMiddle and intNumlarge respectively.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl values of variables intNumSmall, intNumMiddle and intNumlarge as output, which is 1 3 8.
<<<Output>>>
1 3 8

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
		
		InputStreamReader isr= new InputStreamReader(System.in);
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
		
		String strNum = br.readLine();
		String[] strNumList = strNum.split(" ");
		
		Arrays.sort(strNumList);
		
		int intNumSmall = Integer.parseInt(strNumList[0]);
		int intNumMiddle = Integer.parseInt(strNumList[1]);
		int intNumlarge = Integer.parseInt(strNumList[2]);
		
		System.out.println(intNumSmall + " " + intNumMiddle + " " + intNumlarge);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
