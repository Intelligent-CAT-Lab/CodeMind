he variable strNum is initialized with the input. Then it is split into a list of strings by the space character.
Then the list is sorted in ascending order.
Then the first, middle and last elements of the list are converted to integers and assigned to variables intNumSmall, intNumMiddle and intNumlarge respectively.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl values of variables intNumSmall, intNumMiddle and intNumlarge as output, which is 1 3 8.
