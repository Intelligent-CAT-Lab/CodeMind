e variable a, b, c, x and y are initialized with 1500, 2000, 1600, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of a and b is less than 2 times c. If it is, it prints the product of x and a plus the product of y and b.
If it is not, it calculates the minimum of x and y and the maximum of x and y.
Then it calculates the product of 2 times c and the minimum of x and y.
If the maximum of x and y is equal to x, it calculates the minimum of a and 2 times c and the difference between the maximum of x and y and the minimum of x and y.
If the maximum of x and y is equal to y, it calculates the minimum of b and 2 times c and the difference between the maximum of x and y and the minimum of x and y.
Then it prints the final value of the sum of the three calculated values.
<<<Output>>>
1500
