he variable a is initialized with 30 and variable b is initialized with 100.
The if statement checks if variable a is less than or equal to 5. If it is, it prints 0.
The else if statement checks if variable a is less than or equal to 12. If it is, it prints the value of variable b divided by 2.
The else statement prints the value of variable b.
<<<Output>>>
50

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    
    if(a<=5){
      System.out.println(0);
    }
    else if(a<=12){
      System.out.println((int)(b/2));
    }
    else{
      System.out.println(b);
    }
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 10 and variable b is initialized with 100.
The if statement checks if variable a is less than or equal to 5. If it is, it prints 0.
The else if statement checks if variable a is less than or equal to 12. If it is, it prints the value of variable b divided by 2.
The else statement prints the value of variable b.
