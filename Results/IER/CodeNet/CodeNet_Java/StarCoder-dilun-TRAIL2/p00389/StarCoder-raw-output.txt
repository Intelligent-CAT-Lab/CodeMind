he variable base is initialized with 4 and variable K is initialized with 2.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable base is greater than or equal to 1.
Inside the while loop, it initializes two variables low and high with 0 and the value of variable base respectively.
Then it enters another while loop and it checks if the difference between the values of variables high and low is greater than 1.
Inside the while loop, it initializes a variable willNext with the average of the values of variables low and high.
Then it checks if the value of variable willNext is less than or equal to the product of variable K and the difference between the values of variable base and variable willNext.
If it is, it sets the value of variable low to the value of variable willNext.
Otherwise, it sets the value of variable high to the value of variable willNext.
After the while loop finishes, it sets the value of variable next to the value of variable low.
Then it checks if the value of variable next is greater than 0.
If it is, it sets the value of variable base to the value of variable next and increments the value of variable ans by 1.
Otherwise, it breaks out of the while loop.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 3.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1] + arr[i], arr[i]);
        }
        System.out.println(dp[n - 1]);
    }
}
