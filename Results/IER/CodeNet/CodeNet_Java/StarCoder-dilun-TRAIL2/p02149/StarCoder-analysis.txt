he variable max is initialized with 0.
The variable idx is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger x is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max to x and updates the value of variable idx to i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable idx as output, which is 1.
