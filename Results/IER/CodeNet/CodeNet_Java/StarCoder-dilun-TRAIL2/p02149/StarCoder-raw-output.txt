he variable max is initialized with 0.
The variable idx is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger x is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max to x and updates the value of variable idx to i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable idx as output, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		    arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max = 0;
		int idx = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		    if (max < arr[i]) {
		        max = arr[i];
		        idx = i;
		    }
		}
		System.out.println(idx);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 10000000 100000000 1000000000 10000000000```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of 10 elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to
