he variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized with 7, 5 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the remainder of A*i divided by B. If the remainder is equal to C, it prints YES and returns.
After the loop finishes, it prints NO as output.
<<<Output>>>
NO

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int A = sc.nextInt(),B = sc.nextInt(),C = sc.nextInt();
		for(int i = 1; i <= B; i++) {
			if(A*i%B == C) {
				System.out.println("YES");
				return;
			}
		}
		System.out.println("NO");
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 5 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
