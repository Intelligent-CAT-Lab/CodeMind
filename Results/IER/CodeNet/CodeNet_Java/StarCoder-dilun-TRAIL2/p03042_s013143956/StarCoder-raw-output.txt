 variable s is initialized with the input.
The variable m is initialized with the substring of s starting from index 2 and ending at index 3. The substring is converted to an integer and assigned to variable m.
The variable y is initialized with the substring of s starting from index 0 and ending at index 1. The substring is converted to an integer and assigned to variable y.
The if statement checks if y is less than or equal to 12 and m is less than or equal to 12. If it is, it prints "AMBIGUOUS" as output.
The if statement checks if m is greater than 0 and m is less than or equal to 12. If it is, it prints "YYMM" as output.
The if statement checks if y is greater than 0 and y is less than or equal to 12. If it is, it prints "MMYY" as output.
The if statement checks if none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NA" as output.
<<<Output>>>
AMBIGUOUS
