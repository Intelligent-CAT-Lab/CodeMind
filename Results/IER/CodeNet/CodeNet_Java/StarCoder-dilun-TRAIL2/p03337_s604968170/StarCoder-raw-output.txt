he variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable add is initialized with the sum of a and b.
The variable sub is initialized with the difference of a and b.
The variable p is initialized with the product of a and b.
The if statement checks if the value of add is greater than or equal to the value of sub and p. If it is, it prints the value of add.
If the value of sub is greater than or equal to the value of add and p, it prints the value of sub.
If the value of p is greater than or equal to the value of add and sub, it prints the value of p.
