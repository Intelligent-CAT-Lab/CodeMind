e variable n is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable n is greater than or equal to 2.
Inside the while loop, it divides the value of variable n by 2.
After the loop finishes, it adds 1 to variable count.
The condition is met when n is 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * A :???????????°?????? / Finger Counting
 */
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String line;

		long n = sc.nextLong();
		int count = 0;

		if (n > 0) {
			while (n >= 2) {
				n /= 2;
				count++;
			}
			count++;
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
