he variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the probability of getting a head by repeatedlly flipping a coin with a probability of 1/2. The condition is met when i is 1 and j is 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp[n] as output, which is 0.5.
<<<Output>>>
0.5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.io.*;
import static java.lang.Math.*;
import static java.util.Arrays.*;
import static java.util.Collections.*;

public class Main{
	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

	int INF=1<<28;
	double EPS=1e-12;

	int n, m;

	void run(){
		n=sc.nextInt();
		m=sc.nextInt();
		solve();
	}

	void solve(){
		double[] dp=new double[n+1];
		dp[0]=1;
		for(int j=1; j<=n; j++){
			for(int i=1; i<=min(m, j); i++){
				dp[j]+=dp[j-i]/j;
			}
		}
		println(String.format("%.12f", dp[n]));
	}

	void println(String s){
		System.out.println(s);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args){
		new Main().run();
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable m is initialized with 2.
