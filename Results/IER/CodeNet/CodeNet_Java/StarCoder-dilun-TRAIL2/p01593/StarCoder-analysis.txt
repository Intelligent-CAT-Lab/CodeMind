he variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the probability of getting a head by repeatedlly flipping a coin with a probability of 1/2. The condition is met when i is 1 and j is 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp[n] as output, which is 0.5.
