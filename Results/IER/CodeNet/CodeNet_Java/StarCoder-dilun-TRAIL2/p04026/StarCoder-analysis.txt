he variable s is initialized with the string "needed" according to the input.
It initializes an array of 26 integers with the value -1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ch.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of the current character s[i] by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from it.
Then it checks if the value of the current character is greater than or equal to 0 and if the difference between the current index i and the value of the last occurence of the current character is less than 3.
If the condition is met, it prints the values of the last occurence of the current character plus 1 and the current index i plus 1 as output.
If the condition is not met, it sets the value of the current character to the current index i.
After the loop finishes, it prints -1 -1 as output.
