he variable peopleSpeaks is initialized with the input.
It checks if the first element of the array peopleSpeaks is equal to the second element of the array peopleSpeaks. If it is, it prints H as output.
If it is not, it prints D as output.
<<<Output>>>
H

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        try {

            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

            String[] peopleSpeaks = br.readLine().split(" ");
            String atCoDeerSpeak = peopleSpeaks[0];
            String topCoDeerSpeak = peopleSpeaks[1];

            if (atCoDeerSpeak.equals(topCoDeerSpeak)) {
                System.out.println("H");
            } else {
                System.out.println("D");
            }

        } catch (IOException | NumberFormatException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            System.exit(0);
        } catch (final Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            System.exit(0);
        }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```H D
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
