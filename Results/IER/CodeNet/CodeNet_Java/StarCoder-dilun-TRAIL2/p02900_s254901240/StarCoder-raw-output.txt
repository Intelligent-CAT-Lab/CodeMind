e variable A and variable B are initialized with 12 and 18 respectively according to the input.
The gcd function is called to calculate the greatest common divisor of A and B.
The for loop is used to count the number of factors of g.
The if statement is used to check if g is greater than 1.
The final value of count is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
    static long gcd(long a, long b){
        return b == 0? a : gcd(b,a % b); 
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long A = sc.nextLong();
        long B = sc.nextLong();

        long g = gcd(A, B);
        int count = 1;
        for(long i = 2; i*i <= g; i++){
            if(g % i == 0){
                count++;
                while(g % i == 0){
                    g /= i;
                }
            } 
        }
        if(g > 1) count++;

        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12 18
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
