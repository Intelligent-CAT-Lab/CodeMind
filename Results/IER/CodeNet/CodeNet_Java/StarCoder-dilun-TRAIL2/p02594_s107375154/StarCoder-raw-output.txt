he variable x is initialized with 25 according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable x is greater than or equal to 30. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
 public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
    int x = sc.nextInt();
    if(x>=30){
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }else{
      System.out.println("No");
    }
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```25
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
