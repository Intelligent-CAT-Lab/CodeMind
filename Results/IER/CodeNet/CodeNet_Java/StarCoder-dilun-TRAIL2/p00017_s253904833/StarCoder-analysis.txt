e variable shift is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates until there is no more input.
Inside the for loop, it splits the input string into an array of words.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the current word in the array of words.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the shifted word of the current character c in the current word in the array of words by calling the method shiftWord(c, j).
Then it checks if the shifted word is "the", "this" or "that". If it is, it returns the value of variable j as the output.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable j as output, which is 13.
