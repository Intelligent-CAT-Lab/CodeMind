he variable s is initialized with the input string "01B0".
The variable t is initialized with an empty string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of variable s is 'B'. If it is, it removes the last character of variable t.
Otherwise, it adds the character at index i of variable s to variable t.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable t as output, which is 01.
<<<Output>>>
01

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.next();
		int count = 0;
		for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++){
			if(s.charAt(i)=='B') count++;
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```01B0
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "01B0".
The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of variable s is 'B'. If it is, it increments variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
