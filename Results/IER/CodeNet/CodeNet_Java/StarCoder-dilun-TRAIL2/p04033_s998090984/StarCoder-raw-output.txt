e variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable tmp is initialized with the product of a and b.
It checks if tmp is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it sets variable an to 2.
Otherwise, it checks if a is less than 0. If it is, it calculates the difference between b and a plus 1.
Then it checks if the difference is even. If it is, it sets variable an to 1.
After the if-else block, it prints the value of array ans at index an as output, which is "Positive".
<<<Output>>>
Positive

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int arr[] = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		sc.close();
		int ans = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			if (arr[i] % 2 == 0)
				ans += arr[i];
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
Then it creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger arr[i] is even. If it is, it adds the current interger arr[i] to variable ans.
