e variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable tmp is initialized with the product of a and b.
It checks if tmp is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it sets variable an to 2.
Otherwise, it checks if a is less than 0. If it is, it calculates the difference between b and a plus 1.
Then it checks if the difference is even. If it is, it sets variable an to 1.
After the if-else block, it prints the value of array ans at index an as output, which is "Positive".
