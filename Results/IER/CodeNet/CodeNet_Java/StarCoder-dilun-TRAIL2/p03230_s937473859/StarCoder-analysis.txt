he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i * (i + 1) / 2 == n. If it does, it prints "Yes" and i + 1 as output.
Then it prints the following array as output:
```
1 2 3 
2 3 4 
3 4 5 
```
