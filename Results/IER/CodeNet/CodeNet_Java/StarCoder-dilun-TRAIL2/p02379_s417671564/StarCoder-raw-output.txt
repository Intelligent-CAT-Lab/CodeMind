he variable x1, variable y1, variable x2 and variable y2 are initialized with 0, 0, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the distance between the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) by using the formula:
```
distance = sqrt( (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 )
```

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int a[] = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			a[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			sum += a[i];
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
