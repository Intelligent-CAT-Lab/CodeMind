he variable k and variable s are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer x in this range. The value of variable x is also passed to variable z.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer y in this range. The value of variable y is also passed to variable z.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the calculated variable z is within the range [0, 2]. If it does, it adds 1 to variable count. The condition is met when z is 0,1,2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

        // input
        int n = scan.nextInt();
        int k = scan.nextInt();
        int s = scan.nextInt();


        // search
        int count = 0;
        for(int x = 0; x <= k; x++){
            for(int y = 0; y <= k; y++){
                int z = s - x - y;
                if(z >= 0 && z <= k){
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }


        // answer
        System.out.println(count);

    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable k and variable s are initialized with 3, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer x in this range. The value of variable x is also passed to variable z.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer y in this range. The
