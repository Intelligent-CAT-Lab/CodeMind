he variable N is initialized with 1222.
It checks if the first character of variable N is 2. If it is, it increments the value of variable cnt by 1.
It checks if the second character of variable N is 2. If it is, it increments the value of variable cnt by 1.
It checks if the third character of variable N is 2. If it is, it increments the value of variable cnt by 1.
It checks if the fourth character of variable N is 2. If it is, it increments the value of variable cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int cnt = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			int num = sc.nextInt();
			if(num % 2 == 0) cnt++;
		}
		System.out.println(cnt);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger num is even. If it is, it increments the value of variable cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
