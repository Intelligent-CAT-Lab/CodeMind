he variable n is initialized with 20 according to the input.
It calculates the final value of variable n by multiplying it with 800 and subtracting the result from the division of n by 15 multiplied by 200.
<<<Output>>>
16000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int d = sc.nextInt();
        int e = sc.nextInt();
        int f = sc.nextInt();
        int g = sc.nextInt();
        int h = sc.nextInt();
        int i = sc.nextInt();
        int j = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        int l = sc.nextInt();
        int m = sc.nextInt();
        int answer = 0;
        
        if (n >= a && n <= b) {
            answer = answer + 1;
        }
        if (n >= c && n <= d) {
            answer = answer + 1;
        }
        if (n >= e && n <= f) {
            answer = answer + 1;
        }
        if (n >= g && n <= h) {
            answer = answer + 1;
        }
        if (n >= i && n <= j) {
            answer = answer + 1;
        }
        if (n >= k && n <= l) {
            answer = answer + 1;
        }
        if (n >= m && n <= m) {
            answer = answer + 1;
        }
        System.out.println(answer);

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
