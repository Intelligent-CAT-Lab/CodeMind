e variable nums is initialized with 7,6,-1,1,-1,9,2,3,4.
The variable used is initialized with false.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 8 to check each index i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of nums[i] is -1. If it is, it enters another for loop to check each integer k in the range [1,9].
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the value of used[k] is false. If it is, it assigns the value of k to nums[i] and assigns true to used[k].
Then it calls the function solve(idx+1) to solve the next index.
Inside the function solve(idx+1), it checks if the index idx is 9. If it is, it calls the function check() to check if the equation is satisfied.
If the equation is satisfied, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.
After the function solve(idx+1) returns, it returns the value of ret.
After the for loop finishes, it returns the value of ret.
