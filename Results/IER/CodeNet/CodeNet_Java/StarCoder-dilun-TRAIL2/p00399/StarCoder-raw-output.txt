he variable result is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable numDog.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger numDog by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable result.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		int result = 0;

		try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
			String[] numDog = reader.readLine().split(" ");

			for(int i=0;i<numDog.length;i++) {
				result += Integer.parseInt(numDog[i]);
			}

			System.out.println(result);

		}
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 1 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
