he variable a is initialized with 2 and variable b is initialized with 16.
The value of variable k is calculated by adding the values of variables a and b.
Then it checks if the value of variable k is even or odd. If it is even, it divides the value of variable k by 2 and prints the result.
If it is odd, it prints the string "IMPOSSIBLE".
