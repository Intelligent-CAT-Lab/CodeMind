he variable N is initialized with 12.
The variable X is initialized with the value of variable N.
The variable fx is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates while variable N is greater than or equal to 10.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger N by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable fx.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger N by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable fx.
Then it checks if the calculated variable fx is divisible by variable X. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
