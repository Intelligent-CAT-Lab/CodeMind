he variable N is initialized with 12.
The variable X is initialized with the value of variable N.
The variable fx is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates while variable N is greater than or equal to 10.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger N by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable fx.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger N by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable fx.
Then it checks if the calculated variable fx is divisible by variable X. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	 
	int N = sc.nextInt();

	int X = N;

	int fx = 0;


	while(N>=10) {

		fx += N%10;

		N /= 10;

	}

	fx += N;

	if(X%fx == 0) System.out.println("Yes");

	else System.out.println("No");
}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```13
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
