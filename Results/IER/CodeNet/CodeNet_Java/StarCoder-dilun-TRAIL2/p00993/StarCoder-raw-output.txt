he variable fact is initialized with 1. The variable mul is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1510 to calculate the value of variable fact. The value of variable fact is calculated by multiplying the current value of variable fact with the value of variable mul. The value of variable mul is incremented by 1 after each iteration.
After the loop finishes, it adds 2 to the value of variable fact to get the final value of variable fact.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the input is exhausted. The value of variable n is read from the input and it is printed as output.
Inside the while loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 2 + n to print the values of integers i in this range.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable fact as output.
