 variable line is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates over each character c in the string line.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'A' and variable a is true. If it is, it sets variable a to false.
Then it checks if the current character c is 'Z' and variable a is false. If it is, it increments variable count by 1.
Then it checks if the current character c is 'A' and variable a is false. If it is, it sets variable a to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if variable count is not 0. If it is, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to variable count.
Inside the for loop, it appends "AZ" to the string builder sb.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of string builder sb as output.
<<<Output>>>
AZAZ

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

/**
 * A-Z Cat
 */
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String line;
		String[] words;

		line = br.readLine();

		int count = 0;
		boolean a = true;
		for (char c : line.toCharArray()) {
			if (c == 'A' && a) {
				a = false;
			}
			if (c == 'Z' &&!a) {
				count++;
				a = true;
			}
		}

		if (count!= 0) {
			StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
			for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
				sb.append("AZ");
			}
			System.out.println(sb.toString());
		} else {
			System.out.println(-1);
		}
	}
}
</Code>
