variable line is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates over each character c in the string line.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'A' and variable a is true. If it is, it sets variable a to false.
Then it checks if the current character c is 'Z' and variable a is false. If it is, it increments variable count by 1.
Then it checks if the current character c is 'A' and variable a is false. If it is, it sets variable a to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if variable count is not 0. If it is, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to variable count.
Inside the for loop, it appends "AZ" to the string builder sb.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of string builder sb as output.
