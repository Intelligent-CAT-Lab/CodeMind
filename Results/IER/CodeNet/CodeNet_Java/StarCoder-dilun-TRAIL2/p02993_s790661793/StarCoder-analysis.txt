he variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string s at index i and i+1 is equal to the current character of the string s at index i+1 and i+2.
If it does, it sets the value of variable flag to false.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable flag is true. If it is, it prints "Good" as output. Otherwise, it prints "Bad" as output.
