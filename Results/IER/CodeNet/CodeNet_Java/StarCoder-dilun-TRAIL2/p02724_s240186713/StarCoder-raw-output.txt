he variable x is initialized with 1024 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable x is greater than or equal to 500. If it is, it subtracts 500 from the value of variable x and adds 1000 to variable count.
If the value of variable x is less than 500, it enters the else if statement and it checks if the value of variable x is greater than or equal to 5. If it is, it subtracts 5 from the value of variable x and adds 5 to variable count.
If the value of variable x is less than 5, it enters the else statement and it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 1000.
<<<Output>>>
1000
