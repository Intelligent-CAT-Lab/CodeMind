he variable N is initialized with 2.
It enters a while loop and it checks if N is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the remainder of N divided by 26.
Then it appends the character whose ASCII code is equal to the remainder to the end of the string variable sb.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable sb as output, which is "bc".
