he variable ary is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character c in the array ary.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is '+' or '-'. If it is '+', it increments the value of variable num by 1. If it is '-', it decrements the value of variable num by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable num as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] ary = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			ary[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max = ary[0];
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			if (ary[i] > max) {
				max = ary[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ary[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer ary[i] is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the value of ary[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 1
