he variable n is initialized with 8.
It enters a while loop and it checks if n is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it divides n by 3.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

		int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());

		int count = 0;
		while (n > 0) {
			n /= 3;
			count++;
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
