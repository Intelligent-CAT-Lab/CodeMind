he variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The value of variable a is divided by 3 and the remainder is stored in variable c.
The value of variable b is divided by 3 and the remainder is stored in variable d.
The sum of variable a and variable b is divided by 3 and the remainder is stored in variable e.
The if statement checks if any of the variables c, d or e is equal to 0. If any of them is equal to 0, then the output is "Possible". Otherwise, the output is "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Possible

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
 
    int c = a % 3;
    int d = b % 3;
    int e = ( a + b ) % 3;
 
    if ((c==0) || (d==0) || (e==0) ){
      System.out.println("Possible");
    }
    else {
      System.out.println("Impossible");
    }
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
