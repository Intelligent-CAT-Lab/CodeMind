he variable l and variable r are initialized with 2020 and 2040 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from l to r-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i+1 to r to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i and j and mod it by 2019.
After the second for loop finishes, it checks if the calculated variable min is equal to 0. If it is, it breaks out of the first for loop.
After the first for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 1980.
