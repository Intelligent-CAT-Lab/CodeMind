e variable n is initialized with 8.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the current value of variable n is greater than 1.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the new value of variable n by adding 0 to it if it is divisible by 3. Otherwise, it adds 3 to it.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable n as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class Main{
     
    public static void main(String[] args){
    	
    	final Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    	
    	int n = sc.nextInt();
    	int count = 0;
    	
    	for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
    		if(n % i == 0){
    			count++;
    		}
    	}
    	
    	System.out.println(count);
    	
    }
     
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 12.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 12 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current value of variable n is divisible by i. If it is, it increments the value of variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable count as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
