he variable N is initialized with 3 and variable K is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from K to 1 to check each integer x in this range. The value of variable x is also passed to variable kx.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable num[x] by using the following formula:
num[x] = (kx^N) + (kx^N) + (kx^N) +... + (kx^N)
where kx is the value of variable kx.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2*x to K to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable num[x] by using the following formula:
num[x] = num[x] - num[j]
where j is the value of variable j.
Then it calculates the value of variable num[x] by using the following formula:
num[x] = num[x] % MOD
where MOD is the value of variable MOD.
Then it calculates the value of variable ans by using the following formula:
ans = ans + x * num[x]
where x is the value of variable x and num[x] is the value of variable num[x].
Then it calculates the value of variable ans by using the following formula:
ans = ans % MOD
where MOD is the value of variable MOD.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
