he variable s is initialized with the input.
It checks if the variable s is equal to "keyence". If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
If it is not, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it creates a substring of variable s from index 0 to i and from index j to the end of variable s.
Then it checks if the created substring is equal to "keyence". If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
If it is not, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i+1 to the length of variable s. The value of variable j is also passed to variable i.
