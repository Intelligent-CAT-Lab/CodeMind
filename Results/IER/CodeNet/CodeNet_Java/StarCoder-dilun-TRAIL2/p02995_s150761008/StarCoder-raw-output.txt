 variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 4, 9, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable n is initialized with b - a, which is 5.
The variable l is initialized with lcm(c, d), which is 6.
The variable answer is initialized with n - (sum(a, b, c) + sum(a, b, d) - sum(a, b, l)), which is 5 - (1 + 1 - 1), which is 5 - 2, which is 3.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
