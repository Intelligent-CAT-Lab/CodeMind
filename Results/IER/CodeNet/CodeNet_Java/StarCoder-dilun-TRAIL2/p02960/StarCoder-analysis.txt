he variable S is initialized with the input string. The variable d is initialized with the character array of the input string. The variable dp is initialized with an array of 13 elements. The variable base is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the last element of the array d to the first element of the array d. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable j.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger j by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
