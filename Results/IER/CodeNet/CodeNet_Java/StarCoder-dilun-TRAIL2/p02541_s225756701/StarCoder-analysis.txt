variable n is initialized with 11 according to the input.
It calls the function divisorList(2*n) to get a list of all the divisors of 2*n.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates through the list of all the divisors of 2*n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable b by dividing 2*n by the current interger a.
Then it calls the function extgcd(a, b) to get the value of variable g, variable x and variable y.
Then it checks if the value of variable g is 1. If it is, it checks if the value of variable y is negative. If it is, it updates the value of variable ans to the minimum of the current value of ans and the value of -b*y.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
