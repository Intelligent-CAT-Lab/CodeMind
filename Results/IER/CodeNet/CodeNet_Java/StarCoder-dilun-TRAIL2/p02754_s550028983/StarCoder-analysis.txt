he variable num, variable blue and variable red are initialized with 8, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable remainder is initialized with the remainder of the division of num by (blue+red).
The variable countBlue is initialized with the product of the division of num by (blue+red) and blue.
If the remainder is greater than or equal to blue, it means that the remainder is greater than or equal to the number of blue.
So, it adds the number of blue to the variable countBlue.
Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the variable countBlue.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable countBlue as output, which is 11.
