he variable num, variable blue and variable red are initialized with 8, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable remainder is initialized with the remainder of the division of num by (blue+red).
The variable countBlue is initialized with the product of the division of num by (blue+red) and blue.
If the remainder is greater than or equal to blue, it means that the remainder is greater than or equal to the number of blue.
So, it adds the number of blue to the variable countBlue.
Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the variable countBlue.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable countBlue as output, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//入力の読み込み
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int num = sc.nextInt();
		int blue = sc.nextInt();
		int red = sc.nextInt();

		//青と赤のセットを置いた際の余りの数で判断
		int remainder = num%(blue+red);  //置いた際の余り
		int countBlue = num/(blue+red)*blue;  //上記の際の青の数

		if(remainder >= blue) {  //余りが青の数よりも多い場合
			countBlue += blue;  //全ての青の数を足す
		}
		else {                      //余りが青よりも少ない場合
			countBlue += remainder;  //余りの分だけ青を足す
		}
		System.out.print(countBlue);
		sc.close();
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num, variable blue and variable red are initialized with 8, 3 and 4
