he variable l is initialized with the input.
The variable st is initialized with the StringTokenizer class.
The variable answer is initialized with the floor value of the division of the first token of the input by 3.
The output is the value of variable answer.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    String l = br.readLine();
		 StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(l);
    int answer = (int)Math.floor(Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken())/3);
    System.out.println(answer);
    
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
