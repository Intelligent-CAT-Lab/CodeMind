he variable a, b, c, d, e and f are initialized with 1, 2, 10, 20, 15 and 200 respectively according to the input.
The variable waterX is initialized with 0.
The variable ansWater is initialized with 100.
The variable ansSugar is initialized with 0.
The while loop enters and it checks if 100 * a * waterX is less than or equal to f.
If it is, it enters the while loop again and it checks if 100 * a * waterX + 100 * b * waterY is less than or equal to f.
If it is, it enters the while loop again and it checks if water + c * sugarX is less than or equal to f.
If it is, it enters the while loop again and it checks if water + c * sugarX + d * sugarY is less than or equal to f.
If it is, it enters the while loop again and it checks if sugar * (100 + e) is less than or equal to e * (water + sugar).
If it is, it enters the while loop again and it checks if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) is greater than or equal to ansSugar * (water + sugar).
If it is, it updates the value of variable ansWater with the current value of water.
It also updates the value of variable ansSugar with the current value of sugar.
After the while loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ansWater and variable ansSugar as output, which is 100 100.
