he variable X is initialized with 7.
It checks if X is less than or equal to 6. If it is, it prints 1.
If it is not, it checks if X is less than or equal to 11. If it is, it prints 2.
If it is not, it checks if X is divisible by 11. If it is, it prints (long)(X/11*2).
If it is not, it checks if X is greater than or equal to 6. If it is, it prints (long)(Math.floor(X/11)*2+2).
If it is not, it prints (long)(Math.floor(X/11)*2+1).
