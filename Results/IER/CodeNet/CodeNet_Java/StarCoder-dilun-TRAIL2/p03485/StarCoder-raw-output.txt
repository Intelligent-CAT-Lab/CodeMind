he variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The function solve(a, b) is called with the values of a and b as parameters.
The function returns the value of (a + b + 1) / 2, which is 2.
The value of variable a and variable b are printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        System.out.println(solve(a, b));

        sc.close();
    }

    static int solve(int a, int b) {
        return (a + b + 1) / 2;
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
