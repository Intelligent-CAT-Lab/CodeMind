is initialized with the input string "pdbq".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of variable c is 'p' and the character at index n-1-i of variable c is not 'q'.
If it is, it prints "No" as output and returns.
If it is not, it checks if the character at index i of variable c is 'q' and the character at index n-1-i of variable c is not 'p'.
If it is, it prints "No" as output and returns.
If it is not, it checks if the character at index i of variable c is 'b' and the character at index n-1-i of variable c is not 'd'.
If it is, it prints "No" as output and returns.
If it is not, it checks if the character at index i of variable c is 'd' and the character at index n-1-i of variable c is not 'b'.
If it is, it prints "No" as output and returns.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
