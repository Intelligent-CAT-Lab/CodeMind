he variable N is initialized with 3 and variable M is initialized with 4.
The final output is the product of N and M, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;


/**

 */
public class Main {



    boolean main() throws IOException {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(systemin);

        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int M = sc.nextInt();


        System.out.printf("%d\n", N / M);

        sc.close();
        return false;
    }



    PrintStream log;
    PrintStream result = System.out;
    BufferedReader systemin;

    static Main instance = new Main();

    Main() {
        systemin = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        log = new PrintStream(new OutputStream() { public void write(int b) {} } );
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        instance.main();

        instance.systemin.close();
    }


}



</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 12 and variable M is initialized with 3.
The final output is the quotient of N and M, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
