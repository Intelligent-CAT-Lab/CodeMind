he variable a and variable b are initialized with 5 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is even or odd. If it is even, it decreases variable a by 1 and increases variable b by the value of variable a divided by 2.
If it is odd, it decreases variable b by 1 and increases variable a by the value of variable b divided by 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable a and variable b as output, which is 2 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String args[]) {

        // 入力
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int b = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int k = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());

        // 主処理
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                if (a % 2 == 1) {
                    a--;
                }
                b += a / 2;
                a /= 2;

            } else {
                if (b % 2 == 1) {
                    b--;
                }
                a += b / 2;
                b /= 2;
            }

        }
        String result = a + " " + b;

        // 出力
        System.out.println(result);
        sc.close();
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 5 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 2.
