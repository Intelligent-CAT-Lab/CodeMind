he variable a and variable b are initialized with 5 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is even or odd. If it is even, it decreases variable a by 1 and increases variable b by the value of variable a divided by 2.
If it is odd, it decreases variable b by 1 and increases variable a by the value of variable b divided by 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable a and variable b as output, which is 2 3.
