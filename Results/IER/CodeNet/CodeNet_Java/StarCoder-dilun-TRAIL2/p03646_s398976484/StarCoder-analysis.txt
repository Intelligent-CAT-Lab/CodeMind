he variable K is initialized with 0.
The variable x is initialized with 0.
The variable y is initialized with 0.
The array a is initialized with 50 elements.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 49 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a[i].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable a[i] by adding variable y to it.
Then it checks if the current interger i is greater than or equal to 50 - x. If it is, it adds 1 to variable a[i]. The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of array a as output, which is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50.
