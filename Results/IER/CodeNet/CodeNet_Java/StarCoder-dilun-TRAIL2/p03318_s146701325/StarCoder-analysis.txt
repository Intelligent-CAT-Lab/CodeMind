he variable n is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable k by adding the current interger i to variable kk.
Then it checks if the current interger i is 9. If it is, it calculates the value of variable kk by multiplying it by 10.
Then it calculates the value of variable k by adding the current interger i to variable kk.
Then it prints the value of variable k as output.
