he variable k is initialized with 2.
The if statement checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 and 1 and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes variable n with 2*((k+3)/4).
Then it initializes variable curt with n*2 - k.
Then it initializes a 2D array mat with n rows and n columns.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer r in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer c in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if r is odd and (r+c)%n is less than n - curt.
If it is, it sets the value of mat[r][c] to n + (r+c)%n.
Otherwise, it sets the value of mat[r][c] to (r+c)%n.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer x in the array mat[r].
Inside the second for loop, it prints the value of x.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer x in the array mat[r].
Inside the second for loop, it prints the value of x.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints the value of n.
After the first for loop finishes, it prints the value of n.
