e variable H, variable W, variable A and variable B are initialized with 2, 3, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to W-B+1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable comb1 and variable comb2.
The value of variable comb1 is calculated by calling the function comb(H-A-1+B-1+i, B-1).
The value of variable comb2 is calculated by calling the function comb(A-1+W-B, W-B-i).
Then it calculates the value of variable ans by adding the product of variable comb1 and variable comb2 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
