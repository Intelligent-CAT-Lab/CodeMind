he variable W, variable H, variable x, variable y and variable r are initialized with 5, 4, 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the following conditions are met:
1. r <= x
2. x <= (W - r)
3. r <= y
4. y <= (H - r)
If all the conditions are met, it prints "Yes" as output.
If any of the conditions are not met, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{
	public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int M = scanner.nextInt();
        int K = scanner.nextInt();

        if (N >= M && N >= K) {
        	System.out.println("N");
        }

        else if (M >= N && M >= K) {
        	System.out.println("M");
        }

        else if (K >= N && K >= M) {
        	System.out.println("K");
        }
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable M and variable K are initialized with 1, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the following conditions are met:
1. N >= M
2. N >= K
If all the conditions are met, it prints "N" as output.
If any of the conditions are not met, it checks if the following conditions are met:
1. M >= N
2. M >= K
If all the conditions are met, it prints "M" as output.
If any of the conditions are not met, it checks if the following conditions are met:
1. K >= N
2. K >= M
If all the conditions are met, it prints "K" as output.
If any of the conditions are
