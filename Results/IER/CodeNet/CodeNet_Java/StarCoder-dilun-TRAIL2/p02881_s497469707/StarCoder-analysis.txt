he variable n is initialized with 10.
It calculates the maximum value of the square root of n by using the Math.ceil() function.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the maximum value of the square root of n to 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it calculates the values of x and y.
Then it prints the value of (i - 1) + (x - 1) as output.
