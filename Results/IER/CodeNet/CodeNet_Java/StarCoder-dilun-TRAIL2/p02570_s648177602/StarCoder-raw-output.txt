he variable d is initialized with 1000, variable t is initialized with 15 and variable s is initialized with 80.
It calculates the value of variable kakaruhun by dividing variable d by variable s and then rounding up the result to the nearest integer.
Then it checks if the calculated value of variable kakaruhun is less than or equal to variable t. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		// 整数の入力(スペース改行関係なし)
		int a = sc.nextInt();
      int b = sc.nextInt();
      int c = sc.nextInt();

      int d = a + b + c;
      int e = a - b - c;
      int f = a * b * c;

      // 出力
      System.out.println(d);
      System.out.println(e);
      System.out.println(f);
		
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 1, variable b is initialized with 2 and variable c is initialized with 3.
It calculates the value of variable d by adding variables a, b and c.
It calculates the value of variable e by subtracting variables a, b and c.
It calculates the value of variable f by multiplying variables a, b and c.
Then it prints the values of variables d, e and f as output.
<<<Output>>>
