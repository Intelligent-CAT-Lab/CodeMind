he variable N is initialized with 432 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 432 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i and 1.08.
Then it checks if the calculated variable num is equal to N. If it does, it prints the current interger i as output and returns.
If the loop finishes without returning, it prints :(.
