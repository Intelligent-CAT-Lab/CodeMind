he variable N is initialized with 432 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 432 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i and 1.08.
Then it checks if the calculated variable num is equal to N. If it does, it prints the current interger i as output and returns.
If the loop finishes without returning, it prints :(.
<<<Output>>>
432

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i=1;i<=N;i++) {
			if (N%i==0) {
				sum += i;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 12 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 12 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the remainder of the current interger N divided by i.
Then it checks if the calculated variable num is equal to 0. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 28.
<<<Output>>>
28
