he variable N is initialized with 54.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable N is greater than or equal to the value of variable x.
Inside the while loop, it multiplies the value of variable x by 2 and assigns the result to variable x.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x as output, which is 108.
<<<Output>>>
108

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = s.nextInt();
		int x = 1;
		
		while(N >= x){
			x = x * 2;
		}
		System.out.println(x / 2);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```54
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
