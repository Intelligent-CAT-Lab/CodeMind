he variable N and variable K are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans by using the formula:
```ans = K * ((long)(ans / (K - 1))) + ans % (K - 1) + 1;```
The value of variable ans is calculated by using the formula:
```ans = K * ((long)(ans / (K - 1))) + ans % (K - 1) + 1;```
