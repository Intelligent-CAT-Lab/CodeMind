he variable x is initialized with 6.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to infinity to check each integer i in this range. The condition is met when i * (i + 1) / 2 >= x.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable i as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scan.nextInt(), i = 1;
        for (; i * (i + 1) / 2 < x; i++) {}
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
