he variable d and variable c are initialized with 20 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the product of d and c and prints the result as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
	class Main{

		public static void main(String[] args){
	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

	int d;
	int c;
	d=sc.nextInt();
	c=sc.nextInt();
	
	System.out.println(d/c);
	
	
	}
	}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable d and variable c are initialized with 20 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the quotient of d and c and prints the result as output.
<<<Output>>>
