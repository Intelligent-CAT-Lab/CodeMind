he variable fl is initialized with the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the end of the input.
Inside the while loop, it checks the second character of each input string.
If the second character is 'T', it prints the first row of the in array.
If the second character is 'L', it prints the fourth row of the in array.
If the second character is 'U', it prints the second row of the in array.
If the second character is 'R', it prints the fifth row of the in array.
If the second character is 'D', it prints the third row of the in array.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
        new Main().run();
    }
	public void run(){
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		while(scan.hasNext()){
			int n = scan.nextInt();
			int[] arr = new int[n];
			for(int i = 0;i < n;i++){
				arr[i] = scan.nextInt();
			}
			int max = 0;
			for(int i = 0;i < n;i++){
				for(int j = i+1;j < n;j++){
					if(arr[i] > arr[j]){
						int temp = arr[i];
						arr[i] = arr[j];
						arr[j] = temp;
					}
				}
			}
			System.out.println(arr[n-1]);
		}
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the first input.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of n elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n
