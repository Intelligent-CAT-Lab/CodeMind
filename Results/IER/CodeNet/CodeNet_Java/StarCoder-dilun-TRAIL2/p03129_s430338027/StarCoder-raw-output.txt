e variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2.
It checks if n is greater than or equal to k * 2 - 1.
If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
If it is not, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println((n >= k * 2 - 1)? "YES" : "NO");
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
