he variable n is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3510 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable si.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3510 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable bo.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger si by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger bo by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum of bo is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it skips the current iteration of the second for loop and goes to the next iteration of the first for loop.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum of si is divisible by the calculated variable sum of bo. If it is, it prints the values of variables i, j and si/bo as output.
