he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable m is initialized with 14.
It calculates the maximum integer that can be divided by n by dividing m by n.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from the maximum integer to 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if m is divisible by i. If it is, it prints the value of i as output and breaks the loop.
If the loop does not break, it prints -1 as output.
