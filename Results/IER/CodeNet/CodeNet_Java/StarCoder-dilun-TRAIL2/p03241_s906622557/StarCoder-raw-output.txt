he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable m is initialized with 14.
It calculates the maximum integer that can be divided by n by dividing m by n.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from the maximum integer to 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if m is divisible by i. If it is, it prints the value of i as output and breaks the loop.
If the loop does not break, it prints -1 as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();
		
		int max = m/n;
		for (int i = max; i > 0; i--) {
			if (m%i == 0) {
				System.out.println(i);
				break;
			}
		}
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 14
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
