he variable n is initialized with 1 and variable m is initialized with 6.
The condition n * 2 <= m is checked. Since 1 * 2 = 2 is less than 6, the condition is met and variable c is initialized with 1.
The condition m - n * 2 is checked. Since 6 - 2 = 4 is greater than 0, the condition is not met and variable m is initialized with 0.
The condition m / 4 is checked. Since 0 / 4 = 0 is greater than 0, the condition is not met and variable c is incremented by 0.
The condition m / 4 is checked. Since 0 / 4 = 0 is greater than 0, the condition is not met and variable c is incremented by 0.
The final value of variable c is 2.
