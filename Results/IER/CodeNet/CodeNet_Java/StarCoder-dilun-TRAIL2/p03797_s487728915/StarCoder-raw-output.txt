he variable n is initialized with 1 and variable m is initialized with 6.
The condition n * 2 <= m is checked. Since 1 * 2 = 2 is less than 6, the condition is met and variable c is initialized with 1.
The condition m - n * 2 is checked. Since 6 - 2 = 4 is greater than 0, the condition is not met and variable m is initialized with 0.
The condition m / 4 is checked. Since 0 / 4 = 0 is greater than 0, the condition is not met and variable c is incremented by 0.
The condition m / 4 is checked. Since 0 / 4 = 0 is greater than 0, the condition is not met and variable c is incremented by 0.
The final value of variable c is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();
		int c = 0;
		if (n * 2 <= m) {
			c = n;
			m -= n * 2;
		}
		else {
			c = m / 2;
			m = 0;
		}
		c += m / 4;
		System.out.println(c);
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1 and variable m is initialized with 6.
The condition n * 2 <= m is checked. Since 1 * 2 = 2 is less than 6, the condition is met and variable c is initialized with 1.
The condition m - n * 2 is checked. Since 6 - 2 = 4 is greater than 0, the condition is not met and variable
