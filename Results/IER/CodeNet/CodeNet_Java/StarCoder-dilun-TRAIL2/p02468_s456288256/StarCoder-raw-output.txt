he variable m is initialized with 2 and variable n is initialized with 3.
The function pow(m,n) is called and it returns the value of m^n.
The function pow(m,n,1000000007) is called and it returns the value of (m^n)%1000000007.
The value of variable res is initialized with 1.
The while loop is entered and it checks if n is odd or not. If it is odd, it multiplies variable res with m and then it divides n by 2.
If n is even, it multiplies variable res with m and then it divides n by 2.
The loop finishes and it returns the value of variable res.
The value of variable res is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
