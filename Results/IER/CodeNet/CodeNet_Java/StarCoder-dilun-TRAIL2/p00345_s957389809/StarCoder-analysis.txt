e variable o is initialized with the index of the first dot in the input.
The variable p is initialized with the index of the first ( in the input.
The variable l is initialized with the difference between the index of the first dot and the index of the first ( in the input.
The variable d is initialized with the difference between the length of the input and the index of the first dot in the input.
The variable all is initialized with the string of all the digits before the first dot in the input.
The variable sub is initialized with the string of all the digits between the first ( and the first ) in the input.
The variable g is initialized with the greatest common divisor of the two integers x and y.
The function gcd(x, y) returns the greatest common divisor of the two integers x and y.
The function print(x, y) prints the result of the division of x and y.
The function solve() first initializes the Scanner object sc with the input.
Then it initializes the variables o, p, l, d, all and sub with the values calculated from the input.
Then it checks if p is -1. If it is, it prints the division of the integer all and the integer 10 raised to the power of d.
Otherwise, it prints the division of the integer all minus the integer sub and the integer 10 raised to the power of d minus the integer 10 raised to the power of l.
