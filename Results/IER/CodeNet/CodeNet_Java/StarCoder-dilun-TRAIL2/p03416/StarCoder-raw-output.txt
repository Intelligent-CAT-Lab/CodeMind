he variable a and variable b are initialized with 11009 and 11332 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from variable a to variable b to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it creates an array of 5 integers and initializes them with the digits of the current interger i.
Then it checks if the first and the last digit of the array are equal. If they are, it increments the variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) {
      int[] array = new int[5];
      array[0] = i % 10;
      array[1] = i / 10 % 10;
      array[2] = i / 100 % 10;
      array[3] = i / 1000 % 10;
      array[4] = i / 10000 % 10;
      if (array[0] == array[4] && array[1] == array[3]) {
        count++;
      }
    }
    System.out.println(count);
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11009 11332
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
