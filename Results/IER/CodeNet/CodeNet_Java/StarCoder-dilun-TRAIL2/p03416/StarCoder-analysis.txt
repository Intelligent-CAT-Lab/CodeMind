he variable a and variable b are initialized with 11009 and 11332 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from variable a to variable b to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it creates an array of 5 integers and initializes them with the digits of the current interger i.
Then it checks if the first and the last digit of the array are equal. If they are, it increments the variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 10.
