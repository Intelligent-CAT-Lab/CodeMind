he variable r is initialized with 2, variable d is initialized with 10 and variable x is initialized with 20.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the new value of variable x by multiplying it with variable r and subtracting it with variable d.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x as output, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();

		int sum = 0;

		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			int num = sc.nextInt();
			if (num >= a && num <= b) {
				sum += num;
			}
		}

		System.out.println(sum);

		sc.close();
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5, variable a is initialized with 2 and variable b is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger num falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger num to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
