variable n is initialized with 2.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until n is less than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable d by taking the remainder of n divided by 26.
Then it appends the character whose ASCII code is 97 + d to the variable name.
Then it divides n by 26 and subtracts 1 from it.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable name as output, which is "ba".
