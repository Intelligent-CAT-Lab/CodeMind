e variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 1, 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The code checks if a == c. If it is true, it prints the value of variable b as output.
The code checks if b == d. If it is true, it prints the value of variable a as output.
The code checks if a!= c and b!= d. If it is true, it calculates the GCD of the absolute difference of a and c and the absolute difference of b and d.
Then it prints the absolute difference of a and c plus the absolute difference of b and d minus the calculated GCD as output.
