he variable N is initialized with 8.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of 8. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the difference of N and i. If the difference is divisible by i and the quotient is greater than i, then the quotient is added to the list num.
After the loop finishes, it print the sum of the elements in the list num as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.ArrayList;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        String str = br.readLine();
        long N = Long.parseLong(str);
        ArrayList<Long> num = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i=1;i<Math.sqrt(N);i++){
            if ((N-i)%i==0 && (N-i)/i>i){
                num.add((long)(N-i)/i);
            }
        }
        long ans = 0;
        for (long n:num){
            ans += n;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of 100. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the difference of N and i. If the difference is divisible by i and the quotient is greater than i, then the quotient is added to the list num.
After the loop finishes, it print the sum of the elements in the list num as output, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
