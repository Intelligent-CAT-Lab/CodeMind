he variable N is initialized with 8.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of 8. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the difference of N and i. If the difference is divisible by i and the quotient is greater than i, then the quotient is added to the list num.
After the loop finishes, it print the sum of the elements in the list num as output, which is 10.
