he variable num1 and variable num2 are initialized with 8 and 10 respectively according to the input.
The code first converts the input to binary strings and then pads the strings with 0s to make them 32 characters long.
Then it prints the binary strings of the result of the bitwise AND, bitwise OR and bitwise XOR operations.
