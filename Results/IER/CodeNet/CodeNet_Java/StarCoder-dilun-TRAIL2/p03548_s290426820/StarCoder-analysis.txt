he variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 13, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable x is greater than or equal to 0.
If it is, it subtracts the product of variable z and 2 from variable x.
Then it enters another while loop and it checks if the value of variable x is greater than or equal to 0.
If it is, it subtracts the sum of variable y and variable z from variable x.
If it is not, it checks if the value of variable x is greater than or equal to 0.
If it is, it subtracts variable y from variable x.
If it is not, it breaks out of the while loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 3.
