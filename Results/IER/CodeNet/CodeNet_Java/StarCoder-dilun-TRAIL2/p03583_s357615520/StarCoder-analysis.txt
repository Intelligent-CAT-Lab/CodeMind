he variable N is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3500 to check each integer h in this range. The value of variable h is also passed to variable Num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3500 to check each integer w in this range. The value of variable w is also passed to variable Den.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable Num and variable Den.
Then it checks if the calculated variable Den is positive and if the calculated variable Num is divisible by the calculated variable Den. If it does, it prints the values of variables h, ans and w as output, which is 1 2 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable found as output, which is true.
