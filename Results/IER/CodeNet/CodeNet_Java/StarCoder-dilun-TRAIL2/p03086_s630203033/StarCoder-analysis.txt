he variable S is initialized with the input string ATCODER.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string S.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of the string S is one of the four nucleotides A, T, C or G. If it is, it adds the character to the list.
If the character is not one of the four nucleotides, it checks if the list is empty. If it is not empty, it adds the size of the list to the result list.
Then it checks if the list is empty. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
If the list is not empty, it adds the size of the list to the result list.
Then it prints the maximum value of the result list as output.
