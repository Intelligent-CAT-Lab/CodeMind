he variable t is initialized with the input string "apple".
The if statement checks if the last character of the string t is "s". If it is, it concatenates the string "es" to the string t. Otherwise, it concatenates the string "s" to the string t.
After the if statement, it prints the final value of variable t as output, which is "apples".
<<<Output>>>
apples

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int n = scanner.nextInt();
		
		scanner.close();
		
		int sum = 0;
		
		for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
			sum += i;
		}
		
		System.out.println(sum);
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer 10.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 55.
<<<Output>>>
55
