variable zeroes, variable ones and variable k are initialized with 2, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable depth is calculated by dividing the sum of zeroes and ones by (k - 1).
The variable ways is initialized with an array of size ones + 1. The first element of the array is initialized with 1.
The variable res is initialized with 0.
The variable nice is initialized with an array of size ones + 1.
The for loop iterates from 1 to depth. The variable extra is initialized with 0.
The while loop iterates from 0 to depth - i. The variable now is calculated by subtracting (k - 1) * extra from ones.
If now is greater than or equal to 0, the element of nice at index now is set to true.
The for loop iterates from ones to 0. The variable old is initialized with the current value of the loop.
If the element of ways at index old is not 0, the for loop iterates from 1 to k and the variable cur is initialized with the current value of the loop.
If the element of nice at index old + cur is true, the element of ways at index old + cur is incremented by the element of ways at index old.
The element of ways at index old + cur is then modded by MODULO.
After the for loop finishes, the element of res is incremented by the element of ways at index old. The element of res is then modded by MODULO.
After the while loop finishes, the element of res is printed as output.
