he variable s is initialized with the input string. The variable arr is initialized with an array of length s.length().
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to s.length() - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr[i].
Inside the for loop, it calls the method abc() with the values of arr[i], arr[i + 1] and arr[i + 2] as parameters.
The method abc() calculates the value of the current integer by multiplying the first digit by 100, the second digit by 10 and the third digit by 1.
Then it subtracts 753 from the calculated value.
Then it checks if the calculated value is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it returns the value. Otherwise, it returns the value multiplied by -1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 123.
