he variable s is initialized with the input. Then it creates an array a with 4 elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each index i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable num by adding or subtracting the value of a[j] from the value of num based on the value of (1 & (i >> j)).
Then it checks if the calculated variable num is equal to 7. If it is, it prints the value of variable ans as output.
