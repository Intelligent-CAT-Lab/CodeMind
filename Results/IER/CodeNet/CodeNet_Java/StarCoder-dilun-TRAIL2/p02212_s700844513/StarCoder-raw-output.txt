he variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 2, 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with the sum of the four variables a, b, c and d.
Then it calculates the absolute value of the difference between the variable sum and the product of the sum of the two variables a and b, the sum of the two variables a and c and the sum of the two variables a and d.
The minimum of these three values is calculated and stored in the variable min.
The final value of variable min is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
                try {
                        InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
                        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
                        String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

                        int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
                        int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
                        int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
                        int answer = 0;

                        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                                int num = i;
                                int sum = 0;

                                while (num!= 0) {
                                        sum += num % 10;
                                        num /= 10;
                                }

                                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                                        answer = answer + i;
                                }
                        }
                        System.out.println(answer);
                } catch (Exception e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                }
        }

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in
