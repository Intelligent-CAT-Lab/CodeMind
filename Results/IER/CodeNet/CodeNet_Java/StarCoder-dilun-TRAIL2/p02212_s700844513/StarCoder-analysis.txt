he variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 2, 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with the sum of the four variables a, b, c and d.
Then it calculates the absolute value of the difference between the variable sum and the product of the sum of the two variables a and b, the sum of the two variables a and c and the sum of the two variables a and d.
The minimum of these three values is calculated and stored in the variable min.
The final value of variable min is printed as output.
