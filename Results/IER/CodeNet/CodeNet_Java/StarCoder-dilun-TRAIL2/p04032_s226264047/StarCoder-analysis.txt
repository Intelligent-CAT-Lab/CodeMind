he variable c is initialized with the string "needed" and the variable n is initialized with the length of the string.
The if statement checks if the first and second characters of the string are equal. If they are, it prints 1 and 2 as output.
The for loop checks if the current character and the next two characters are equal. If they are, it prints the index of the current character and the index of the next character as output.
If none of the conditions are met, it prints -1 and -1 as output.
