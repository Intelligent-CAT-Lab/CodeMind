he variable c is initialized with the string "needed" and the variable n is initialized with the length of the string.
The if statement checks if the first and second characters of the string are equal. If they are, it prints 1 and 2 as output.
The for loop checks if the current character and the next two characters are equal. If they are, it prints the index of the current character and the index of the next character as output.
If none of the conditions are met, it prints -1 and -1 as output.
<<<Output>>>
1 2
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	void run() {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] a = new int[n];
		int[] b = new int[n];

		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			a[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}

		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			b[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}

		int[] c = new int[n];

		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
		}

		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			System.out.println(c[i]);
		}
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Main().run();
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1
2
3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3.
The array a is initialized with 3 elements.
The array b is initialized with 3 elements.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 2 to initialize the elements of array a.
