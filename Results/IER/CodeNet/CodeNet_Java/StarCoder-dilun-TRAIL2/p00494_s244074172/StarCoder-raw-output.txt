he variable str is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable str. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cnt.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of variable str is equal to 'I', 'O' or 'J'. If it is, it initializes the first element of the array tmp with the current character.
Then it enters a while loop and it iterates while the current character of variable str is equal to the next character of variable str. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cnt.
Inside the while loop, it increments the value of variable cnt by 1.
Then it checks if the current character of variable str is equal to the last character of variable str. If it is, it breaks out of the while loop.
Then it initializes the second element of the array tmp with the value of variable cnt.
Then it adds the array tmp to the list list.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the size of list minus 1. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmpJ, tmpO and tmpI.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the first element of the array tmpO is equal to 'O'. If it is, it checks if the first element of the array tmpI is equal to 'I' and the first element of the array tmpJ is equal to 'J'. If it is, it checks if the second element of the array tmpI is greater than or equal to the second element of the array tmpO and the second element of the array tmpJ is greater than or equal to the second element of the array tmpO. If it is, it checks if the value of variable answer is less than the second element of the array tmpO. If it is, it updates the value of variable answer with the second element of the array tmpO.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
