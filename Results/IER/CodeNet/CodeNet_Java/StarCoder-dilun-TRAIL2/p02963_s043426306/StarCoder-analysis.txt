e variable s is initialized with 3.
Then it calculates the values of variables x and y.
If s is equal to 1e18, then x is set to 0 and y is set to 1000000000.
Otherwise, x is set to 1000000000-s%1000000000 and y is set to s/1000000000+1.
After the calculation, it prints the values of x and y as output.
