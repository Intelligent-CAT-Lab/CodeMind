e variable s is initialized with the input.
The variable abc is initialized with 3 boolean variables.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each character in the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'a', 'b' or 'c'. If it is, it sets the corresponding boolean variable to true.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each boolean variable in the array abc.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current boolean variable is true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if all the boolean variables in the array abc are true. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int a[] = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            a[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        
        int max = a[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if( a[i] > max ) max = a[i];
        }
        
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input.
The variable a is initialized with n integer variables.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer in the array a.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the current integer variable with the input.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer in the array a.
Inside the for loop, it
