he variable x is initialized with 90.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The variable ans is assigned the value of the function lcm(360,x)/x.
The function lcm(360,x) returns the least common multiple of 360 and x.
The function gcd(360,x) returns the greatest common divisor of 360 and x.
The function lcm(360,x)/x returns the least common multiple of 360 and x divided by x.
The function lcm(360,x)/x is then divided by x to get the least common multiple of 360 and x.
The final value of variable ans is printed as output, which is 180.
<<<Output>>>
180

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main{
public static void main(String[] args){
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
  int x=sc.nextInt();
  int ans=0;

  System.out.println(lcm(360,x)/x);
}

 static int gcd(int a, int b) 
    { 
    if (a == 0) 
        return b;  
    return gcd(b % a, a);  
    } 
      
    // method to return LCM of two numbers 
    static int lcm(int a, int b) 
    { 
        return (a*b)/gcd(a, b); 
    } 
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```180
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
