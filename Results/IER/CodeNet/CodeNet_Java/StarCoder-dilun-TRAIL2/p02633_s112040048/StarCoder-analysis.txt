he variable x is initialized with 90.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The variable ans is assigned the value of the function lcm(360,x)/x.
The function lcm(360,x) returns the least common multiple of 360 and x.
The function gcd(360,x) returns the greatest common divisor of 360 and x.
The function lcm(360,x)/x returns the least common multiple of 360 and x divided by x.
The function lcm(360,x)/x is then divided by x to get the least common multiple of 360 and x.
The final value of variable ans is printed as output, which is 180.
