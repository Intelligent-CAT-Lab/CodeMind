he variable x is initialized with 2.
The variable kakeru is initialized with x*x*x, which is 2*2*2, which is 8.
The output is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	
	public void solve(){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int x=sc.nextInt();
		int kakeru;
		kakeru=x*x*x;
		System.out.println(kakeru);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Main obj=new Main();
		obj.solve();
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 3.
The variable kakeru is initialized with x*x*x, which is 3*3*3, which is 27.
The output is 27.
<<<Output>>>
27
