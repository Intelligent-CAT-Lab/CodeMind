he variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable ans by dividing (b-1) by (a-1).
Then it checks if (b-1) is divisible by (a-1). If it is, it prints the value of variable ans as output.
If it is not, it prints the value of variable ans+1 as output.
