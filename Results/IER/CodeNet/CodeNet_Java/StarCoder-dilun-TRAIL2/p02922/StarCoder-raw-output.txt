he variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable ans by dividing (b-1) by (a-1).
Then it checks if (b-1) is divisible by (a-1). If it is, it prints the value of variable ans as output.
If it is not, it prints the value of variable ans+1 as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
    
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();

    int ans = (b-1)/(a-1);
    if((b-1)%(a-1)==0) {
    	System.out.println(ans);
    }else {
    	System.out.println(ans+1);
    }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
