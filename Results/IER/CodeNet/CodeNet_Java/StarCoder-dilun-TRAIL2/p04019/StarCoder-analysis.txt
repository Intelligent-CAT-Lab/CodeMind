he variable s is initialized with the input string SENW.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable char.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character char is equal to 'S', 'N', 'W' or 'E'. If it does, it sets the corresponding boolean variable to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the boolean variables checkS, checkN, checkW and checkE are all true. If it does, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
