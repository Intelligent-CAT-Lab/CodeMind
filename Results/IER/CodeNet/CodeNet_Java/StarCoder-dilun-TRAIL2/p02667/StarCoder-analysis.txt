he variable T is initialized with the input string. The variable N is initialized with the length of the string T.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1 to check each character in the string T. If the character is '1', it enters another for loop to check the length of consecutive '1's.
If the length is odd, it adds the index of the first '1' to the list of indexes.
After the for loop finishes, it calculates the sum of the number of '1's and the number of '0's.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the size of the list of indexes.
For each index, it calculates the number of '0's between the current index and the previous index.
After the for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from the sum of the number of '1's to 1.
For each index, it calculates the number of '0's between the current index and the previous index.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output.
