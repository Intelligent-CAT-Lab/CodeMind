he variable N and variable M are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable c is initialized with 1900.0*M + 100.0*(N-M) = 1900.0*1 + 100.0*(1-1) = 1900.0 + 0 = 1900.0.
The variable p is initialized with 1.0.
The variable res is initialized with 0.0.
The variable q is initialized with 1.0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 1999999 to calculate the value of variable res.
The variable q is multiplied by 1-p to calculate the value of variable q.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 1900.0.
<<<Output>>>
1900

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int N = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
      int M = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
      int res = 0;
      for(int i = 0; i<N; i++){
          int x = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
          if(x%M == 0) res++;
      }
      System.out.println(res);
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable M are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable res is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 4 to calculate the value of variable res.
The variable x is initialized with the next integer in the input stream.
The if statement checks if x is divisible by M. If it is,
