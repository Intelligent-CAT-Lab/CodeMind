he variable N and variable M are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable c is initialized with 1900.0*M + 100.0*(N-M) = 1900.0*1 + 100.0*(1-1) = 1900.0 + 0 = 1900.0.
The variable p is initialized with 1.0.
The variable res is initialized with 0.0.
The variable q is initialized with 1.0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 1999999 to calculate the value of variable res.
The variable q is multiplied by 1-p to calculate the value of variable q.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 1900.0.
