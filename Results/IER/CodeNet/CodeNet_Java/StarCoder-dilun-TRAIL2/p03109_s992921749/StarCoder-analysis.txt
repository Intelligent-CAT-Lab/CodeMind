he variable s is initialized with the input string. Then it splits the string s with the character '/' and stores the result in the array buf.
Then it converts the string in buf[1] to an integer and stores the result in the variable mon.
Then it converts the string in buf[2] to an integer and stores the result in the variable day.
Then it checks if the value of variable mon is less than or equal to 4. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to "Heisei". Otherwise, it sets the value of variable ans to "TBD".
After the if statement, it prints the value of variable ans as output.
