he variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the values of a and b are less than or equal to 9. If they are, it prints the product of a and b as output.
If they are not, it prints -1 as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        if (a <= 9 && b <= 9)
            System.out.println(a*b);
        else
            System.out.println(-1);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
