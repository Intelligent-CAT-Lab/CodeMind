he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 3 and 8 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is less than b and b is less than c. If it is true, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{

    int a,b,c;

    public void input(){
	Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
	a = scan.nextInt();
        b = scan.nextInt();
	c = scan.nextInt(); 
        
    }
 


    public void output(){
	if(a < b && b < c){
         
	    System.out.println("Yes");
        }else{
	    System.out.println("No");
	}

      
    }
 public static void main(String[] args){
     Main p = new Main();
     p.input();
     p.output();
 }
}
  
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is less than b and b is less than c. If it is true, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No
