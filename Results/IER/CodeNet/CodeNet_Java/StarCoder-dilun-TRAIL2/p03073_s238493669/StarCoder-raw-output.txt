riable s is initialized with the input.
The variable n is initialized with the length of the string s.
The variable p1 is initialized with '0'.
The variable p2 is initialized with '1'.
The variable pattern1 is initialized with 0.
The variable pattern2 is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates over each character c in the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is not equal to the variable p1. If it is not, it increments the variable pattern1 by 1.
Then it checks if the current character c is not equal to the variable p2. If it is not, it increments the variable pattern2 by 1.
Then it assigns the value of the opposite of the current value of variable p1 to variable p1.
Then it assigns the value of the opposite of the current value of variable p2 to variable p2.
After the loop finishes, it print the minimum value of the variables pattern1 and pattern2 as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class Main {
    
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	  FastReader sc = new FastReader();
	  String s = sc.next();
	  int n = s.length();
	  // There are only two pattern s will transform to...
	  // 101010101010101010...
	  // 010101010101010101...
	  char p1 = '0';
	  char p2 = '1';
	  int pattern1 = 0;
	  int pattern2 = 0;
	  
	  for(char c: s.toCharArray()) {
		  if (c!= p1) { pattern1++; }
		  if (c!= p2) { pattern2++; }
		  
		  p1 = (p1 == '0')? '1' : '0';
		  p2 = (p2 == '1')? '0' : '1';
	  }
	  
	  System.out.println
