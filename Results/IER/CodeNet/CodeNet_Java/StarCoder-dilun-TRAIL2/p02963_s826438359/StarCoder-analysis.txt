ariable s is initialized with 3.
It calculates the square root of variable s and stores it in variable sq.
Then it checks if sq*sq is equal to s. If it is, it prints the value of sq, 0, 0, sq, 0 and 0.
If it is not, it calculates the value of variable t by subtracting sq*sq from s.
Then it prints the value of sq, 1, t, sq, 0 and 0.
