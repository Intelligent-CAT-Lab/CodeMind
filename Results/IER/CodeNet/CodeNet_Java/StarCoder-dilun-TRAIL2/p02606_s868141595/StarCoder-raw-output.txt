he variable l, variable r and variable d are initialized with 5, 10 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the difference between r and l-1 and divides it by d.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// your code goes here
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		int a[]=new int[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			a[i]=sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max=a[0];
		int min=a[0];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			if(a[i]>max)
			{
				max=a[i];
			}
			if(a[i]<min)
			{
				min=a[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max-min);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
The array a is initialized with 5 elements.
The variable max is initialized with the first element of array a.
The variable min is initialized with the first element of array a.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each element of array a.
If the current element is greater than the variable max, it updates the variable max with the current element.
If the current element is less than the variable min, it updates the variable min with the current element.
After the loop finishes, it prints the difference between variable max and variable min as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
