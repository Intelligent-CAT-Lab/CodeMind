he variable a is initialized with the input string.
The variable b is initialized with the string "2018" concatenated with the substring of variable a starting from index 4.
The substring of variable a starting from index 4 is "01/07".
The value of variable b is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
2018/01/07

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int a = stdIn.nextInt();
		int b = stdIn.nextInt();
		int c = stdIn.nextInt();
		
		int d = a + b + c;
		
		System.out.println(d);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with the first input integer.
The variable b is initialized with the second input integer.
The variable c is initialized with the third input integer.
The variable d is initialized with the sum of variables a, b and c.
The value of variable d is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
