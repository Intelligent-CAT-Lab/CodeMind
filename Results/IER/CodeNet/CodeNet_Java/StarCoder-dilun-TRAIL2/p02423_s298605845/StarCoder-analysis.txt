e variable x is initialized with 8.
The variable bs is initialized with a BitSet of size 32.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 31 to check each bit i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to the BitSet bs.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the bit at position i is set or not. If it is set, it sets the bit at position i in the BitSet bs.
After the loop finishes, it prints the BitSet bs as output.
The variable bs is flipped from 0 to 31.
The variable bsa is initialized with a BitSet of size 32.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 30 to check each bit i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to the BitSet bsa.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the bit at position i is set or not. If it is set, it sets the bit at position i + 1 in the BitSet bsa.
After the loop finishes, it prints the BitSet bsa as output.
The variable bsa is flipped from 0 to 31.
The variable bsa is initialized with a BitSet of size 32.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 30 to check each bit i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to the BitSet bsa.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the bit at position i + 1 is set or not. If it is set, it sets the bit at position i in the BitSet bsa.
After the loop finishes, it prints the BitSet bsa as output.
