e variable alphabets is initialized with 26 elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable alphabets.
Inside the for loop, it increments the value of the corresponding element of the array alphabets by 1.
Then it enters a while loop and it checks if the size of the priority queue pq is 1. If it is, it prints the length of the input string as output.
If it is not, it enters another while loop and it removes the two nodes with the highest frequency from the priority queue pq.
Then it creates a new node z with the sum of the frequencies of the two nodes and the two nodes as its children.
Finally, it adds the new node z to the priority queue pq.
After the while loop finishes, it enters a while loop and it removes the two nodes with the highest frequency from the priority queue pq.
Then it creates a new node z with the sum of the frequencies of the two nodes and the two nodes as its children.
Finally, it adds the new node z to the priority queue pq.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the length of the input string as output.
