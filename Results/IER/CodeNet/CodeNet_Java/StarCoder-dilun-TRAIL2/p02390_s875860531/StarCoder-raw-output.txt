he variable S is initialized with 46979 according to the input.
The variable hour is initialized with the integer division of S by 3600.
The variable min is initialized with the integer division of S by 60, and the remainder of the division is subtracted from S.
The variable sec is initialized with the integer division of S by 60, and the remainder of the division is subtracted from S.
The output is formatted with the String.format method.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int M = sc.nextInt();

        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= M; j++) {
                result += i * j;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input.
The variable M is initialized with 4 according to the input.
The variable result is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it adds the product of i and j to variable result.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 24.
<<<Output>>>
24
