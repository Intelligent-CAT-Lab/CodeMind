e variable odd is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is odd or not. If it is odd, it adds 1 to variable odd. The condition is met when i is 0,1 and 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable odd as output, which is 2.
