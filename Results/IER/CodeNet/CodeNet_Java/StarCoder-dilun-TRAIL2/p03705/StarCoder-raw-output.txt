he variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 4 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the condition a>b or (n==1&&a!=b) is true. If it is true, it prints 0 as output.
If the condition is not true, it checks if a==b. If it is true, it prints 1 as output.
If the condition is not true, it calculates the value of expression (n-2)*(b-a)+1 and prints it as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

	public class Main {

		public static void main(String[] args) {

			Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
			
			long n = sc.nextLong();
			long a = sc.nextLong();
			long b = sc.nextLong();
			
			
			if(a>b||(n==1&&a!=b)) {
				System.out.println(0);
				return;
			}
			if(a==b) {
				System.out.println(1);
				return;
			}
			
			System.out.println((n-2)*(b-a)+1);
			
	    }
				
	}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 4 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
