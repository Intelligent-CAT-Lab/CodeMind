he variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 4 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the condition a>b or (n==1&&a!=b) is true. If it is true, it prints 0 as output.
If the condition is not true, it checks if a==b. If it is true, it prints 1 as output.
If the condition is not true, it calculates the value of expression (n-2)*(b-a)+1 and prints it as output.
