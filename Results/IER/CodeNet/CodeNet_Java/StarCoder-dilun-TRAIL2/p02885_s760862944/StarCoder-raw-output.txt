he variable A is initialized with 12 and variable B is initialized with 4.
The value of variable A is subtracted by 2 times the value of variable B.
If the result is less than or equal to 0, the value of variable result is set to 0.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        int result = 0;

        result = A + (2 * B);
        if(result <= 0){
            result = 0;
        }
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A is initialized with 12 and variable B is initialized with 4.
The value of variable A is added by 2 times the value of variable B.
If the result is less than or equal to 0, the value of variable result is set to 0.
