variable S is initialized with the input string "010".
The variable n is initialized with the length of the string S.
The variable s is initialized with an array of length n.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n-1 to initialize the array s with the digits of the string S.
The variable sum is initialized with an array of length n+1.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n-1 to initialize the array sum with the sum of the digits of the string S.
The function cannotFlip is defined to check if the number of ones in the range [leftMostUnreachable+1, rightMostUnreachable+1] is equal to 0 or equal to the total number of digits in the range [leftMostUnreachable+1, rightMostUnreachable+1].
The function cannotFlip is passed to the binarySearch function to find the smallest number k such that cannotFlip(k) is true.
The binarySearch function returns the smallest number k such that cannotFlip(k) is true.
The value of variable answer is initialized with the value of k-1.
The output of the code is the value of variable answer.
