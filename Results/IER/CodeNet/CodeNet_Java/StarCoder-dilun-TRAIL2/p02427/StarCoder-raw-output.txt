he variable n is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 16 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it prints the value of variable i and then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger temp is odd. If it is, it prints the value of variable j. The condition is met when j is 0,2,4.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
