he variable n is initialized with 7 and variable k is initialized with 4.
The value of variable n is divided by variable k and the remainder is stored in variable ans.
The value of variable ans is then printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.math.*;
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long n = sc.nextLong();
        long k = sc.nextLong();
        long ans = 0;
        for (long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            ans += (i%k == 0)? 1 : 0;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 7 and variable k is initialized with 4.
The for loop iterates from 1 to 7 and checks if the remainder of i divided by k is 0. If it is, it adds 1 to variable ans.
The value of variable ans is then printed as output.
