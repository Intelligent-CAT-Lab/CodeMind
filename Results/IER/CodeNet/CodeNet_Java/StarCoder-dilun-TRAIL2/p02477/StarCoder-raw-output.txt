he variable A is initialized with 5 and variable B is initialized with 8.
The code multiplies the two variables and prints the result as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.math.*;

class Main{
	public static void main(String Args[]){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String str = sc.next();
		BigInteger A = new BigInteger(str);
		str = sc.next();
		BigInteger B = new BigInteger(str);
		System.out.println(A.add(B));
	}
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A is initialized with 5 and variable B is initialized with 8.
The code adds the two variables and prints the result as output.
