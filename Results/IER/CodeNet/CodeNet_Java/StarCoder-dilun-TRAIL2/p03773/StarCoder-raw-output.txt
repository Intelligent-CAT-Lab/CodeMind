e variable A is initialized with 9 and variable B is initialized with 12.
The value of variable A + variable B is calculated and stored in variable ans.
If the value of variable A + variable B is greater than 23, then the value of variable ans is calculated by subtracting 24 from the value of variable A + variable B.
Otherwise, the value of variable ans is calculated by adding the value of variable A + variable B.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 21.
<<<Output>>>
21

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();

        int ans = A + B > 23? A + B - 24 : A + B;
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12 12
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A is initialized with 12 and variable B is initialized with 12.
The value of variable A + variable B is calculated and stored in variable ans.
If the value of variable A + variable B is greater than 23, then the value of variable ans is calculated by subtracting 24 from the value of variable A + variable B.
Otherwise, the value of variable ans is calculated by adding the value of variable A + variable B.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 24.
