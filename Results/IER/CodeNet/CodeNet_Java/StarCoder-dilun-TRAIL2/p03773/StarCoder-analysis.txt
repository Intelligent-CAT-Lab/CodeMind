e variable A is initialized with 9 and variable B is initialized with 12.
The value of variable A + variable B is calculated and stored in variable ans.
If the value of variable A + variable B is greater than 23, then the value of variable ans is calculated by subtracting 24 from the value of variable A + variable B.
Otherwise, the value of variable ans is calculated by adding the value of variable A + variable B.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 21.
