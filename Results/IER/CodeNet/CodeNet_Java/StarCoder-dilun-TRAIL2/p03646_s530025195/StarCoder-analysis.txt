he variable K is initialized with 0.
The variable a is initialized with an array of length 50, and each element is initialized with 49.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 49.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is equal to the current interger j. If it is, it adds 50 to the current element of variable a.
Otherwise, it decrements the current element of variable a by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the length of variable a as the first line of output, and then it prints the elements of variable a as the second line of output.
