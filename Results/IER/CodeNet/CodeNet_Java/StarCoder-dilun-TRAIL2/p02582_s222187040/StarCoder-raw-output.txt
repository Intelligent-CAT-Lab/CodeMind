he variable s is initialized with the input string "RRS".
The variable r is initialized with the string "R".
The variable count is initialized with the index of the first occurrence of the string "R" in the string s.
The variable lastcount is initialized with the index of the last occurrence of the string "R" in the string s.
The if statement checks if the string s is equal to "RRR". If it is, it prints "3" as output.
The else if statement checks if the string s is equal to "SSR". If it is, it prints "1" as output.
The else if statement checks if the string s is equal to "SRS". If it is, it prints "1" as output.
The else if statement checks if the string s is equal to "RSS". If it is, it prints "1" as output.
The else if statement checks if the variable count is equal to 0 and the variable lastcount is equal to 1 or if the variable count is equal to 1 and the variable lastcount is equal to 2. If it is, it prints "2" as output.
The else if statement checks if the variable count is equal to 0 and the variable lastcount is equal to 2 or if the variable count is equal to 2 and the variable lastcount is equal to -1 or if the variable count is equal to 0 and the variable lastcount is equal to -1 or if the variable count is equal to 1 and the variable lastcount is equal to -1. If it is, it prints "1" as output.
The else if statement checks if the string s is equal to "SSS". If it is, it prints "0" as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    String s = sc.nextLine();
    String r = "R";
    int count = s.indexOf(r);
    int lastcount = s.lastIndexOf(r);
    if(s.contentEquals("RRR")){
      System.out.println("3");
    }else if(s.contentEquals("SSR")){
      System.out.println("1");
    }else if
