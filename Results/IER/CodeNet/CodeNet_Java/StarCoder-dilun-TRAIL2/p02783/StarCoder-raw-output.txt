he variable h is initialized with 10 and variable a is initialized with 4.
The value of variable h is divided by the value of variable a. The result is stored in variable n.
If the remainder of the division is greater than 0, then variable n is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable n as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        try(Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in) ) {
            String[] line = sc.nextLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.valueOf(line[0]);
            int a = Integer.valueOf(line[1]);

            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                if (i % a == 0) {
                    sum += i;
                }
            }

            // 出力
            System.out.println(sum);
        }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 and variable a is initialized with 3.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the remainder of the division of i by a is 0. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 18.
<<<Output>>>
18
