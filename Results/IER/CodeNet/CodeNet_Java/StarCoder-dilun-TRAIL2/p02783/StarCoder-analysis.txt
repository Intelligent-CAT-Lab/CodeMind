he variable h is initialized with 10 and variable a is initialized with 4.
The value of variable h is divided by the value of variable a. The result is stored in variable n.
If the remainder of the division is greater than 0, then variable n is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable n as output, which is 3.
