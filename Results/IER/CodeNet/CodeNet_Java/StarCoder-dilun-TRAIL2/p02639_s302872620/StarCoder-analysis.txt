variable x is initialized with an array of integers [0, 2, 3, 4, 5] according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the index of the current interger i + 1 as output, which is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
