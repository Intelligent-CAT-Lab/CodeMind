 variable x is initialized with an array of integers [0, 2, 3, 4, 5] according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the index of the current interger i + 1 as output, which is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    try (final var stdin = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
         final var br = new BufferedReader(stdin)) {
      final var x = Arrays.stream(br.readLine().split(" "))
       .mapToInt(Integer::parseInt)
       .toArray();

      for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
        if (x[i] == 0) {
          System.out.println(i + 1);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
