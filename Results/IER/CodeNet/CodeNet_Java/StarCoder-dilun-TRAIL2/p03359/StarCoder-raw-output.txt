he variable a and variable b are initialized with 5 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable b is greater than or equal to variable a. If it is, it prints the value of variable a. Otherwise, it prints the value of variable a minus 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
class Main{
    public static void main(String arg[]){
        Scanner scn=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scn.nextInt();
        int b = scn.nextInt(); 
        if(b>=a){
            System.out.println(a);
        }else{
            System.out.println(a-1);
        }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
