 variable mem is initialized with 10 elements. The variable pos is initialized with 0.
The variable sb is initialized with an empty string.
The variable c is initialized with the first character of the input.
The variable idx is initialized with the value of (c - 33) / 10.
The for loop is executed 3 times. The first time, it executes 0 times. The second time, it executes 1 times. The third time, it executes 2 times.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable idx is less than the value of variable pos. If it is, it appends '<' to the variable sb.
Then it assigns the value of variable idx to variable pos.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the absolute value of the difference between the value of variable pos and the value of variable c is less than the absolute value of the difference between the value of variable mem at the position of variable pos and the value of variable c. If it is, it appends '-' to the variable sb.
Then it assigns the value of variable c to the position of variable mem at the position of variable pos.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the absolute value of the difference between the value of variable mem at the position of variable pos and the value of variable c is less than the absolute value of the difference between the value of pos and the value of variable c. If it is, it appends '+' to the variable sb.
Then it assigns the value of variable c to the position of variable mem at the position of variable pos.
After the loop finishes, it appends '.' to the variable sb.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable sb as output.
