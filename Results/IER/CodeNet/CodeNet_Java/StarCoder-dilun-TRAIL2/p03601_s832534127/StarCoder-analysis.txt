NO-ANSWER
he variable A, variable B, variable C, variable D, variable E and variable F are initialized with 1, 2, 10, 20, 15 and 200 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to F/(100*A) to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable buf.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to F/(100*B) to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable buf.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the calculated variable buf falls within the range [0, F]. If it does, it adds the current interger buf to variable water. The condition is met when buf is 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to F/C to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable buf.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to F/D to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable buf.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the calculated variable buf falls within the range [0, F]. If it does, it adds the current interger buf to variable sugar. The condition is met when buf is 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160,
