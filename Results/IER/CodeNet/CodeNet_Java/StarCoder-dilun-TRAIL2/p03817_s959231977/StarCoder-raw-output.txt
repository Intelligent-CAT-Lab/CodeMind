he variable N is initialized with 7.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the variable N is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the number of times the loop will run by dividing the variable N by 11.
Then it multiplies the variable cnt by 2.
Then it calculates the remainder of the variable N divided by 11.
Then it enters another while loop and it checks if the variable N is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the number of times the loop will run by dividing the variable N by 11.
Then it multiplies the variable cnt by 2.
Then it calculates the remainder of the variable N divided by 11.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.*;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = input.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[N];
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			arr[i] = input.nextInt();
		}
		int[] dp = new int[N];
		dp[0] = arr[0];
		for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
			dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1] + arr[i], arr[i]);
		}
		System.out.println(dp[N - 1]);
	}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to initialize the array arr with 5 elements.
Then it
