he variable N is initialized with 7.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the variable N is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the number of times the loop will run by dividing the variable N by 11.
Then it multiplies the variable cnt by 2.
Then it calculates the remainder of the variable N divided by 11.
Then it enters another while loop and it checks if the variable N is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the number of times the loop will run by dividing the variable N by 11.
Then it multiplies the variable cnt by 2.
Then it calculates the remainder of the variable N divided by 11.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 10.
