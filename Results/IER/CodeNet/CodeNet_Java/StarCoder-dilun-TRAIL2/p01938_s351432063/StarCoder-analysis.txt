he variable ins is initialized with the input string "AIZU".
The variable length is initialized with the length of the input string.
The variable pre_char is initialized with the ASCII value of character 'A'.
The variable cnt is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the ASCII value of character c is greater than the value of variable pre_char. If it is, it adds the difference between the ASCII value of character c and the value of variable pre_char to variable cnt.
If it is not, it adds the difference between the ASCII value of character c and the value of variable pre_char plus 26 to variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 10.
