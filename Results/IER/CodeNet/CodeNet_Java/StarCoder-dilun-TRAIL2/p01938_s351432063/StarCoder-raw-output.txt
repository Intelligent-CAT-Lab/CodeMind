he variable ins is initialized with the input string "AIZU".
The variable length is initialized with the length of the input string.
The variable pre_char is initialized with the ASCII value of character 'A'.
The variable cnt is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the ASCII value of character c is greater than the value of variable pre_char. If it is, it adds the difference between the ASCII value of character c and the value of variable pre_char to variable cnt.
If it is not, it adds the difference between the ASCII value of character c and the value of variable pre_char plus 26 to variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String ins = sc.next();
		int length = ins.length();
		int pre_char = 'A';
		int cnt = 0;
		for (int i=0;i<length;i++) {
			int c = ins.charAt(i);
			if (c > pre_char) cnt = cnt + (c - pre_char);
			else cnt = cnt + (c - pre_char) + 26;
			pre_char = c;
		}
		System.out.println(cnt / 26);
	}
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```AIZU
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable ins is initialized with the input string "AIZU".
The variable length is initialized with the length of the input string.
The variable pre_char is initialized with the ASCII value of character 'A'.
The variable cnt is initialized with
