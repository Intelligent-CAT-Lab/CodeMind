e variable N is initialized with 2 and variable MOD is initialized with 998244353 according to the input.
It initializes a 2D array table with size N+1 x N+1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from N to 1 to check each integer rem in this range. The value of variable rem is also passed to the inner for loop.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to N+1 to check each integer pos in this range. The value of variable pos is also passed to the inner for loop.
Inside the inner for loop, it calculates the value of variable table[pos][rem] by checking the value of table[pos + 1][rem] and table[pos][rem-factor].
The value of variable factor is calculated by taking the minimum of pos and N+1-pos.
If the value of variable factor is less than the value of variable rem, it adds the value of table[pos][rem-factor] to the value of table[pos][rem] and modulos it by MOD.
After the inner for loop finishes, it prints the final value of table[1][N] as output, which is 1.
