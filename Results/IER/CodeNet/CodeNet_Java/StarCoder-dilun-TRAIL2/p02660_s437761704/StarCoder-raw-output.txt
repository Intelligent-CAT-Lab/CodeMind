e variable N is initialized with 24.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the condition q * q > N is met.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable div by taking the power of q with the value of variable e.
Then it checks if the value of N is divisible by the value of div. If it is, it divides the value of N by the value of div and increments the value of variable ans.
Then it increments the value of variable e by 1.
Then it checks if the value of q is 2. If it is, it increments the value of q by 1.
Then it checks if the value of q is greater than 2. If it is, it increments the value of q by 2.
Then it checks if the value of q * q is greater than the value of N. If it is, it breaks out of the while loop.
Then it checks if the value of N is not equal to 1. If it is, it increments the value of ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.math.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(final String[] args){
        final Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long N = sc.nextLong();
        int ans = 0;
        long q = 2;
        int e = 1;
        long div;

        while(true){
            div = (long) Math.pow(q, e);
            if(N % div == 0){
                N /= div;
                ans++;
                e++;
                continue;
            }

            while(N % q == 0){
                N /= q;
            }
            if(q == 2) q ++;
            else q += 2;
            e = 1;
            if(q * q > N) break;
        }

        if(N!= 1){
            ans++;
        }

        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
