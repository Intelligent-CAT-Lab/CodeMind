he variable string is initialized with the input.
It initializes an array of 26 integers with 0.
It initializes an array of 26 characters with the alphabet.
It initializes an array of characters with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string. The value of variable i is also passed to variable chars.
Inside the for loop, it increments the count of the alphabet character at index i in the array count.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25. The value of variable i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the count of the alphabet character at index i in the array count is 0. If it is, it sets the boolean variable isNOTfound to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the boolean variable isNOTfound is true. If it is, it prints the alphabet character at index i in the array alphabet.
Otherwise, it prints "None".
