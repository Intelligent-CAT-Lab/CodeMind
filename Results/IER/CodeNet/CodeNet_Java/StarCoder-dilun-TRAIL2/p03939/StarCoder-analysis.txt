he variable N is initialized with 1 and variable d1 is initialized with 3. Variable x is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1. The condition is met when N is 1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans by adding the value of variable d1 to it. The value of variable d1 is calculated by the following formula:
(2*N+2)*d1 + 5*x
The value of variable x is calculated by the following formula:
(double)N+2/N*x
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
