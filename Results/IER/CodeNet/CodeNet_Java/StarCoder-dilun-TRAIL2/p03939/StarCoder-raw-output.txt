he variable N is initialized with 1 and variable d1 is initialized with 3. Variable x is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1. The condition is met when N is 1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans by adding the value of variable d1 to it. The value of variable d1 is calculated by the following formula:
(2*N+2)*d1 + 5*x
The value of variable x is calculated by the following formula:
(double)N+2/N*x
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		
		int ans = 0;
		
		for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
			int x = sc.nextInt();
			if(x>=a && x<=b) {
				ans++;
			}
		}
		
		System.out.println(ans);
		sc.close();
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 and variable a is initialized with 1. Variable b is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4. The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3 and 4.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable x by reading the next integer from the input.
Then it checks if the value of variable x falls within the range [1, 10]. If it does, it increments the value of variable ans by
