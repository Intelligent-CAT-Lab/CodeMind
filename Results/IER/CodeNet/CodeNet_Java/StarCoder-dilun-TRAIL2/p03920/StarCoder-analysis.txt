he variable N is initialized with 4.
It enters a while loop and it checks if N is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it initializes variable sum with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to infinity to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is greater than or equal to N. If it is, it prints the current interger i as output and it subtracts the current interger i from variable N.
After the loop finishes, it enters the next iteration of the while loop and it checks if N is greater than 0.
