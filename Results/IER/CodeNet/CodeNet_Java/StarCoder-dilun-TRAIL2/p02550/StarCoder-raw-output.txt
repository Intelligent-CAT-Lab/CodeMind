he variable N, variable X and variable M are initialized with 6, 2 and 1001 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable prev.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable now by squaring the value of variable prev and taking the modulo of M.
Then it checks if the calculated variable now is equal to 0. If it is, it enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 0 to i to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable ans.
Then it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
