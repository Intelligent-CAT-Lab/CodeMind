e variable H, variable W, variable h and variable w are initialized with 3, 3, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w. If it is, it prints "No" as output.
Otherwise, it prints "Yes" as output.
Then it initializes a 2-dimensional array a with size H x W.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to H - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to W - 1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable j.
Inside the second for loop, it sets the value of a[i][j] to 1_000_000_000 - 1.
Then it checks if i + h - 1 is less than H and j + w - 1 is less than W. If it is, it sets the value of a[i + h - 1][j + w - 1] to -1_000_000_000.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to H - 1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to W - 1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the third for loop, it prints the value of a[i][j] and it prints a space if j is less than W - 1. Otherwise, it prints a new line.
