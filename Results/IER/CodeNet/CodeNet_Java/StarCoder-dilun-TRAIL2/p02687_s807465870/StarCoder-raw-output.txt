he variable pre is initialized with the input.
It checks if the variable pre is equal to "ABC". If it is, it prints "ARC" as output. Otherwise, it prints "ABC" as output.
<<<Output>>>
ARC

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var scaner = new Scanner(System.in);
        var pre = scaner.nextLine();

        System.out.println(pre.equals("ABC")? "ARC":"ABC");
    }

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ABC
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
