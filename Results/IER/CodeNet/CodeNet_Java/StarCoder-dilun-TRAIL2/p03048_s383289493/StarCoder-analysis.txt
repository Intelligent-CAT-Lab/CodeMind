NO-ANSWER
he variable R, G and B are initialized with 1, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable N is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N/R. The value of variable i is also passed to variable r.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to r/G. The value of variable j is also passed to variable r.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if (r - G * j) % B == 0. If it does, it adds 1 to variable count. The condition is met when r is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94,
