he variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The gcd of 2 and 3 is calculated by calling the gcd method with parameters 2 and 3.
The lcm of 2 and 3 is calculated by calling the lcm method with parameters 2 and 3.
The final output is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        
        System.out.print(gcd(A,B));
  
        
	}
	
	  private static long gcd(long m, long n) {
	        if(m < n) return gcd(n, m);
	        if(n == 0) return m;
	        return gcd(n, m % n);
	    }
    
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The gcd of 2 and 3 is calculated by calling the gcd method with parameters 2 and 3.
The final output is 1.
<<<Output>>>
