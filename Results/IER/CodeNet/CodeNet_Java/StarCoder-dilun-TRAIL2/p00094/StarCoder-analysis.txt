he code first initializes a Scanner object with the input stream of System.in.
Then it enters a while loop and it keeps iterating until the Scanner object has no more input.
Inside the while loop, it reads two double values from the Scanner object and assigns them to variables x and y.
Then it calculates the value of the expression (x*y)/3.305785 and prints the result.
