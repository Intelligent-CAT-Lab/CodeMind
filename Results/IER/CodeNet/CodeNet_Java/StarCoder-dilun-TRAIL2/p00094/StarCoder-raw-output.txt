he code first initializes a Scanner object with the input stream of System.in.
Then it enters a while loop and it keeps iterating until the Scanner object has no more input.
Inside the while loop, it reads two double values from the Scanner object and assigns them to variables x and y.
Then it calculates the value of the expression (x*y)/3.305785 and prints the result.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		while(sc.hasNext()) System.out.println(sc.nextDouble()*sc.nextDouble()*sc.nextDouble());
	}	
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```15 25 35
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code first initializes a Scanner object with the input stream of System.in.
Then it enters a while loop and it keeps iterating until the Scanner object has no more input.
Inside the while loop, it reads three double values from the Scanner object and assigns them to variables x, y and z.
Then it calculates the value of the expression (x*y*z) and prints the result.
