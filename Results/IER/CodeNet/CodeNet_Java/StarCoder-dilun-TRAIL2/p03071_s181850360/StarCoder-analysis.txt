variable A and variable B are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The code checks if A and B are equal. If they are, it prints the sum of A and B as output.
If they are not equal, it checks if A is greater than B. If it is, it prints the sum of 2A and 1 as output.
If it is not, it prints the sum of 2B and 1 as output.
