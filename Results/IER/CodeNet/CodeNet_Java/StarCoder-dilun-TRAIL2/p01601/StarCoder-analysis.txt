e variable n is initialized with 13.
The for loop iterates from 0 to infinity.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer n-i is a palindrome. If it is, it prints the value of n-i and breaks the loop.
If the current integer n-i is not a palindrome, it checks if the current integer n+i is a palindrome. If it is, it prints the value of n+i and breaks the loop.
If the current integer n+i is not a palindrome, it increments i by 1 and repeats the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of i as output, which is 12.
