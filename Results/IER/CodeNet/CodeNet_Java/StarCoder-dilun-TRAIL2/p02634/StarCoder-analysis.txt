he variable A, B, C and D are initialized with 1, 1, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable MOD is initialized with 998244353L.
The variable cell is initialized with a 2-dimensional array of size C x D.
The array is filled with 0L.
The first row and first column of the array are filled with 1L.
The second row is filled with the product of the first row and the value of variable B.
The second column is filled with the product of the first column and the value of variable A.
The for loop iterates from A to C - 1 and the for loop iterates from B to D - 1.
Inside the for loop, the value of cell[i][j] is calculated by multiplying the value of cell[i - 1][j] and the value of j, and then adding the value of cell[i][j - 1] and the value of i.
The value of cell[i][j] is then subtracted by the product of the value of cell[i - 1][j - 1], the value of i and the value of j.
The value of cell[i][j] is then added by the value of MOD.
The value of cell[i][j] is then added by the value of cell[i - 1][j].
The value of cell[i][j] is then added by the value of cell[i][j - 1].
The value of cell[i][j] is then printed as output.
