he variable D is initialized with 10 and variable L is initialized with 5.
The code enters a while loop and it reads the input line by line.
Inside the while loop, it splits the input line into two parts by the space character.
Then it converts the first part of the input line into an integer and assigns it to variable D.
Then it converts the second part of the input line into an integer and assigns it to variable L.
Then it checks if the value of variable D is divisible by the value of variable L. If it is, it prints the value of variable D divided by the value of variable L as output.
If it is not, it prints the value of variable D divided by the value of variable L plus the value of variable D modulo the value of variable L as output.
