he variable D is initialized with 10 and variable L is initialized with 5.
The code enters a while loop and it reads the input line by line.
Inside the while loop, it splits the input line into two parts by the space character.
Then it converts the first part of the input line into an integer and assigns it to variable D.
Then it converts the second part of the input line into an integer and assigns it to variable L.
Then it checks if the value of variable D is divisible by the value of variable L. If it is, it prints the value of variable D divided by the value of variable L as output.
If it is not, it prints the value of variable D divided by the value of variable L plus the value of variable D modulo the value of variable L as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws NumberFormatException, IOException {

		InputStreamReader is = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(is);

		String str;
		while((str=br.readLine())!=null){
			String[] sp = str.split(" ");

			int D = Integer.parseInt(sp[0]);
			int L = Integer.parseInt(sp[1]);

			if(D % L == 0){
				System.out.println(D / L);
			} else{
				System.out.println(D / L + D % L);
			}
		}
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable D is initialized with 10 and variable L is initialized with 3.
The code enters a while loop and it reads the input line by line.
Inside the while loop, it splits the input line into two parts by the space character.
