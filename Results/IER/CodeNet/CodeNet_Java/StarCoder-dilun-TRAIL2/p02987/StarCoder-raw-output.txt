he variable s is initialized with the input.
The array s is sorted in ascending order.
Then it checks if the first and second characters of the array s are equal and if the third and fourth characters are equal. If they are, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max = arr[0];
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			if (arr[i] > max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max);
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input.
The array arr is initialized with n elements.
The variable max is initialized with the first element of the array arr.
The for loop iterates from 1 to n-1 and checks if the current element of the array arr is greater than the variable max. If it is, it updates the variable max with the current element.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable max as output.
<<<Output>>>
5
