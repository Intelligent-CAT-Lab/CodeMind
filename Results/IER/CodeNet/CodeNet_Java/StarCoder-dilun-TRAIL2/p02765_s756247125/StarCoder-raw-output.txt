he variable n is initialized with 2 and variable r is initialized with 2919.
The value of variable na is calculated by the following formula:
```
na = n>=10?r:100*(10-n)+r
```
If n is greater than or equal to 10, then the value of variable na is equal to r. Otherwise, the value of variable na is equal to 100*(10-n)+r.
The value of variable na is 2919.
<<<Output>>>
2919

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import static java.lang.Integer.*;
import static java.lang.Long.*;
import static java.lang.Math.*;
import static java.lang.System.*;

public class Main {
	public static final int MOD = 1000000007;
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int i,j;
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(in);
		int n = parseInt(sc.next());
		int r = parseInt(sc.next());
		sc.close();
		int na = n>=10?r:100*(10-n)+r;
		out.println(na);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2919
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable r is initialized with 2919.
The value of variable na is calculated by the following formula:
```
na = n>=10?r:100*(10-n)+r
```
If n is greater than or equal to 10, then the value of variable na is equal to r. Otherwise, the value of variable na is equal to 100*(10-n)+r.
The value of variable na is 2919.
<<<Output>>>
2919
