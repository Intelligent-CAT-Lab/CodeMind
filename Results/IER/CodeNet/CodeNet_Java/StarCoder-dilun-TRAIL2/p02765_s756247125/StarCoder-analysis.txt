he variable n is initialized with 2 and variable r is initialized with 2919.
The value of variable na is calculated by the following formula:
```
na = n>=10?r:100*(10-n)+r
```
If n is greater than or equal to 10, then the value of variable na is equal to r. Otherwise, the value of variable na is equal to 100*(10-n)+r.
The value of variable na is 2919.
