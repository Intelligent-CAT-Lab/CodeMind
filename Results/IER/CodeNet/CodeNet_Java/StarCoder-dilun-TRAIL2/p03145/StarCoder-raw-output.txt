he variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 3, 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The code calculates the average of the three variables by dividing the product of x and y by 2.
The final value of the average is printed as output.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scan.nextInt();
        int y = scan.nextInt();
        int z = scan.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println(x*y*z);
        
    }
    
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 3, 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
