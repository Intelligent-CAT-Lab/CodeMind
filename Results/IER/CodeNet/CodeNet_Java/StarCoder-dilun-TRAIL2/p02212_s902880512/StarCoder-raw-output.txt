he variable arr is initialized with 4 elements. The variable total is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr[i].
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable total.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr[i].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the absolute value of the difference between the variable total and the product of the current interger i and the sum of the first two elements of the array arr.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int[] arr = new int[4];
		int total = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
		    arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		    total += arr[i];
		}
		int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
		for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++) {
		    min = Math.min(min, Math.abs(total - (arr[0] + arr[i]) * 2));
		}
		System.out.println(min);
	}
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized with 4 elements. The variable total is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr[i].
