he variable arr is initialized with 4 elements. The variable total is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr[i].
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable total.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr[i].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the absolute value of the difference between the variable total and the product of the current interger i and the sum of the first two elements of the array arr.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 1.
