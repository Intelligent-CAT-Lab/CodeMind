he variable t is initialized with the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if there are still characters in the input.
Inside the while loop, it replaces the word "apple" with a new line character "\n" and replaces the word "peach" with the word "apple".
Then it replaces the new line character "\n" with the word "peach".
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable t as output, which is "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach."
