he variable t is initialized with the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if there are still characters in the input.
Inside the while loop, it replaces the word "apple" with a new line character "\n" and replaces the word "peach" with the word "apple".
Then it replaces the new line character "\n" with the word "peach".
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable t as output, which is "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach."
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
	while(s.hasNext()) {
	    String t = s.nextLine();
	    t = t.replace("apple", "\n");
	    t = t.replace("peach", "apple");
	    t = t.replace("\n", "peach");
	    System.out.println(t);
	}
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple.
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
