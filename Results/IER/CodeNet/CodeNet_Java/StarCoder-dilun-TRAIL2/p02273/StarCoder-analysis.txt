he variable n is initialized with 1.
The variable a is initialized with (0,0).
The variable b is initialized with (100,0).
The method koch is called with n, a and b as parameters.
Inside the method, it checks if n is 0. If it is, it returns.
Otherwise, it calculates the coordinates of the points s, t and u.
The value of variable cos60 is calculated with Math.cos(Math.PI * 60.0 / 180.0).
The value of variable sin60 is calculated with Math.sin(Math.PI * 60.0 / 180.0).
The value of variable s is initialized with ((2.0 * a.x + 1.0 *b.x) / 3.0, (2.0 * a.y + 1.0 * b.y) / 3.0).
The value of variable t is initialized with ((1.0 * a.x + 2.0 *b.x) / 3.0, (1.0 * a.y + 2.0 * b.y) / 3.0).
The value of variable u is initialized with ((t.x - s.x) * cos60 - (t.y - s.y) * sin60 + s.x, (t.x - s.x) * sin60 + (t.y - s.y) * cos60 + s.y).
The method koch is called with n - 1, a, s as parameters.
The method koch is called with n - 1, s, u as parameters.
The method koch is called with n - 1, u, t as parameters.
The method koch is called with n - 1, t, b as parameters.
After the method returns, it prints the coordinates of the points a, s, u, t and b.
