he variable x is initialized with the input string. Variable c is initialized with 0. Variable len is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string x. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of the string x is 'T'. If it is, it decrements variable c by 1.
If it is not, it checks if variable c is less than 0. If it is, it subtracts variable c from variable len.
Then it increments variable c by 1.
After the loop finishes, it adds the absolute value of variable c to variable len.
