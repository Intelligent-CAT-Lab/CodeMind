able N is initialized with 5.
An array of size 5 is created and initialized with the values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 3 respectively.
An arraylist of size 0 is created to store the signs of the differences between consecutive heights.
The variable prev is initialized with Integer.MIN_VALUE.
A for loop iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable next_diff.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sign of the difference between heights[i + 1] and heights[i] by dividing next_diff by its absolute value.
Then it checks if i is 0. If it is, it sets the value of variable prev to next_sign.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable prev is equal to next_sign. If it is, it adds the value of variable prev to the arraylist signed.
Otherwise, it adds the value of variable prev to the arraylist signed and sets the value of variable prev to next_sign.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable prev is not equal to Integer.MIN_VALUE. If it is, it adds the value of variable prev to the arraylist signed.
Then it creates an array of size 5 to store the number of times each sign occurs.
A for loop iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable prev_sign.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is 1. If it is, it sets the value of variable curr_sign to next_sign.
Otherwise, it checks if i is 2. If it is, it sets the value of variable curr_sign to next_sign.
Otherwise, it checks if i is 3. If it is, it sets the value of variable curr_sign to next_sign.
Otherwise, it checks if i is 4. If it is, it sets the value of variable curr_sign to next_sign.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable curr_sign is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if the value of variable prev_sign is equal to 1 and the value of variable next_sign is equal to -1. If it is, it adds 1 to the value of variable counts at index 0.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable curr_sign is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if the value of variable prev_sign is equal to -1 and the value of variable next_sign is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 1 to the value of variable counts at index 1.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable curr_sign is equal to 0. If it is, it adds 1 to the value of variable counts at index 2.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable curr_sign is equal to next_sign. If it is, it adds 1 to the value of variable counts at index 3.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable curr_sign is equal to -next_sign. If it is, it adds 1 to the value of variable counts at index 4.
After the loop finishes, it prints the values of the array counts.
