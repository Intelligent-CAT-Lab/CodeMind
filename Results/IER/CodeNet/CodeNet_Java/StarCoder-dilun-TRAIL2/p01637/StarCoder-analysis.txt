he variable M is initialized with the value of the input M.
The variable rD is initialized with the value of the input r.
The variable rR is initialized with the value of the input r.
The variable cD is initialized with the value of the input r.
The variable cR is initialized with the value of the input r.
The variable max is initialized with the value of -1.
The variable D0 is initialized with the value of (100*cD+rD-1)/rD.
The variable C0 is initialized with the value of (100*cR+rR-1)/rR.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 100.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 100.
The variable changeD is initialized with the value of D0+i.
The variable changeR is initialized with the value of C0+j.
The variable jpn is initialized with the value of M-changeD-changeR.
The if statement checks if the value of variable jpn is less than 0. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the for loop.
The variable remD is initialized with the value of changeD*rD/100-cD.
The variable remR is initialized with the value of changeR*rR/100-cR.
The variable jpn is incremented by the value of (remD*100/rD+remR*100/rR).
The variable max is incremented by the value of jpn.
The value of variable max is printed as output.
