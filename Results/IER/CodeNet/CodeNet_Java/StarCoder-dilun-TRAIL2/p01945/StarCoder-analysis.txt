he variable str is initialized with the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the string str contains the substring "()". If it does, it replaces all the occurrences of "()" with "".
Then it converts the string str to an array of characters and stores it in the variable input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the array input. The value of variable i is also passed to variable starIndex.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of the array input is '*'. If it does, it assigns the value of i to variable starIndex.
Then it assigns the value of starIndex - 1 to variable left and starIndex + 1 to variable right.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the character at index left of the array input is '('. If it does, it enters another while loop and it checks if the character at index right of the array input is ')'. If it does, it increments the value of variable result.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 2.
