he variable a and variable b are initialized with 54 and 20 respectively according to the input.
The function GCD is called with the values of variables a and b as parameters.
The function GCD checks if a is less than b. If it is, it swaps the values of variables a and b.
Then it checks if a is divisible by b. If it is, it returns b as the value of GCD.
Otherwise, it calls the function GCD again with the values of variables b and a mod b as parameters.
The function GCD then checks if a mod b is equal to 0. If it is, it returns b as the value of GCD.
Otherwise, it calls the function GCD again with the values of variables a mod b and b as parameters.
The function GCD then checks if a mod b is equal to 0. If it is, it returns b as the value of GCD.
This process continues until a mod b is equal to 0.
After the function GCD returns the value of b, it is returned as the value of GCD.
After the function GCD returns the value of b, it is returned as the value of GCD.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;

class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        String[] input = br.readLine().split(" ");
        int a = Integer.parseInt(input[0]);
        int b = Integer.parseInt(input[1]);

        System.out.println(LCM(a, b));
    }

    public static int LCM (int a, int b) {
        if (a > b) {
            int temp = a;
            a = b;
            b = temp;
        }
        if (a % b == 0) return a;
        else return LCM (b, a%b);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```54 20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
