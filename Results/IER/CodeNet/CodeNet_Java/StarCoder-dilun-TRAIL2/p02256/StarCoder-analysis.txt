he variable a and variable b are initialized with 54 and 20 respectively according to the input.
The function GCD is called with the values of variables a and b as parameters.
The function GCD checks if a is less than b. If it is, it swaps the values of variables a and b.
Then it checks if a is divisible by b. If it is, it returns b as the value of GCD.
Otherwise, it calls the function GCD again with the values of variables b and a mod b as parameters.
The function GCD then checks if a mod b is equal to 0. If it is, it returns b as the value of GCD.
Otherwise, it calls the function GCD again with the values of variables a mod b and b as parameters.
The function GCD then checks if a mod b is equal to 0. If it is, it returns b as the value of GCD.
This process continues until a mod b is equal to 0.
After the function GCD returns the value of b, it is returned as the value of GCD.
After the function GCD returns the value of b, it is returned as the value of GCD.
