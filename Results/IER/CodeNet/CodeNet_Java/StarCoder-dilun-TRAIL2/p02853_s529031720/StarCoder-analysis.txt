he variable X and variable Y are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable ans by adding the maximum of 0 and 4 - X and 4 - Y multiplied by 100000.
Then it checks if X is equal to 1 and Y is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 400000 to variable ans.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 400000.
