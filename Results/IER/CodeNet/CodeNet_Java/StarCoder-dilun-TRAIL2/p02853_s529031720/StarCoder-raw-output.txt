he variable X and variable Y are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable ans by adding the maximum of 0 and 4 - X and 4 - Y multiplied by 100000.
Then it checks if X is equal to 1 and Y is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 400000 to variable ans.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 400000.
<<<Output>>>
400000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main implements Runnable {

    private static int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Run with 32MB stack
        Thread thread = new Thread(null, new Main(), "", 32 * 1024 * 1024);
        thread.start();
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        final Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        solve(scanner);
    }

    static void solve(Scanner scanner) {
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            ans += i;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }

}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 55.
<<<Output>>>
55
