he variable N is initialized with 2 and variable K is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i and variable K-1. The condition is met when i is 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int K = sc.nextInt();
        int ans = K;
        for(int i=2;i<=N;i++){
            ans *= K-1;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 and variable K is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i and variable K-1. The condition is met when i is 2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
