he variable N is initialized with 2 and variable K is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i and variable K-1. The condition is met when i is 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
