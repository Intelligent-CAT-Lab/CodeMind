he variable a is initialized with 8 and variable b is initialized with 13.
The variable n is initialized with b - a, which is 5.
The final value of variable n is multiplied by (n + 1) / 2 and subtracted by b, which is 5 * (5 + 1) / 2 - 13 = 10.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = scanner.nextInt();
    int b = scanner.nextInt();
    int n = b - a;
    System.out.println(n * (n + 1) / 2 - b);
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 13
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
