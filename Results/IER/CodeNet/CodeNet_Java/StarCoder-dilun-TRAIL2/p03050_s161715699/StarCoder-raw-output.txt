variable n is initialized with 8.
It calls the method divisors(n) to get the list of divisors of n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through the list of divisors of n.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current divisor is greater than 1000000. If it is, it skips the current divisor and continues to the next divisor.
If the current divisor is not greater than 1000000, it checks if the current divisor is greater than 1. If it is, it checks if the current divisor is equal to n.
If it is not, it calculates the number of times the current divisor can be divided by n.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
