he variable N is initialized with 16 according to the input.
The value of N is divided by 10 and the remainder is checked.
If the remainder is 2,4,5,7 or 9, the output is "hon".
If the remainder is 0,1,6 or 8, the output is "pon".
If the remainder is 3, the output is "bon".
<<<Output>>>
pon

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();

        if(N%2==0){
            System.out.println("even");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("odd");
        }
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```16
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 16 according to the input.
The value of N is divided by 2 and the remainder is checked.
If the remainder is 0, the output is "even".
If the remainder is 1, the output is "odd".
<<<Output>>>
