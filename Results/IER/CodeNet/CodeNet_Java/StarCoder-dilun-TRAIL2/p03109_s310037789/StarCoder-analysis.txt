he variable S is initialized with the input string "2019/04/30".

The first element of the array s is converted to an integer year by the method Integer.parseInt(s[0]).
The second element of the array s is converted to an integer month by the method Integer.parseInt(s[1]).
The third element of the array s is converted to an integer day by the method Integer.parseInt(s[2]).
The if statement checks if year is less than 2019. If it is, it prints "Heisei".
The else if statement checks if year is equal to 2019. If it is, it checks if month is greater than or equal to 5. If it is, it prints "TBD".
