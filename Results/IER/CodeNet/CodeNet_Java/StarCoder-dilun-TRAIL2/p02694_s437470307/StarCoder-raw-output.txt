he variable X is initialized with 103.
The variable P is initialized with 100.
It enters a while loop and it checks if P is less than X.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the new value of P by adding P/100.
It increments the value of variable cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[N];
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int[] arr2 = new int[N];
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
            arr2[i] = arr[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr2);
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
            if(arr[i] == arr2[i]){
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(cnt);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of size 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr[i].
Inside the for loop, it initializes the value of variable arr2 with an array of size 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr2[i].
