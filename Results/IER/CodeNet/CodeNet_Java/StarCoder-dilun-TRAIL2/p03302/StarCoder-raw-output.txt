he variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 11 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of a and b is equal to 15. If it is, it prints +.
If it is not, it checks if the product of a and b is equal to 15. If it is, it prints *.
If it is not, it prints x.

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
