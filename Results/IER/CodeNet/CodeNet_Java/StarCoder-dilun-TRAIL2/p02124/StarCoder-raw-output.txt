he variable x is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 0/100, which is 0.
Inside the for loop, it adds "3" to the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is "ai1333".
<<<Output>>>
ai1333

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x = sc.nextInt();
		int y = sc.nextInt();
		int z = sc.nextInt();
		int a = x + y + z;
		int b = x * y * z;
		int c = x - y - z;
		int d = x / y / z;
		int e = x % y % z;
		System.out.println(a + " " + b + " " + c + " " + d + " " + e);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 1, variable y is initialized with 2, variable z is initialized with 3.
It calculates the sum of variables x, y and z and stores it in variable a.
It calculates the product of variables x, y and z and stores it in variable b.
It calculates the difference of variables x, y and z and stores it in variable c.
It calculates the quotient of variables x, y and z and stores it in variable d.
It calculates the remainder of variables x, y and z and stores it in variable e.
After the calculations, it print the fianl values of variables a, b, c, d and e as output, which is "6 6 0 0 1".
<<<Output>>>
6 6 0 0 1
