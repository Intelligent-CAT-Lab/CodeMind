he variable N is initialized with 2 and variable X is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 511 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to X to check each integer k in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the values of dp[1-t][j][k] and adds it to variable sum.
Then it calculates the value of dp[t][j^k][k] by adding the value of dp[1-t][j][k] to the value of sum.
Then it modifies the value of dp[t][j^k][k] by adding the value of dp[t][j^k][k] and the value of sum.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to X to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it adds the value of dp[1-t][X][i] to the value of ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
