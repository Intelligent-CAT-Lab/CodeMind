he variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4000, 2000 and 500 respectively according to the input.
The function help is called with the values of variables K, A and B as parameters.
Inside the function, it checks if A is less than or equal to B. If it is, it checks if A is greater than or equal to K. If it is, it returns 1.
If it is not, it checks if A is greater than or equal to K. If it is, it returns 1.
If it is not, it calculates the difference between A and B.
Then it calculates the quotient of K minus A and the difference between A and B.
Then it calculates the sum of the product of 2 and the quotient of K minus A and the difference between A and B.
Then it returns the final value of the sum as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

import static java.lang.System.in;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)throws IOException{
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long K = sc.nextLong(), A=sc.nextLong(), B=sc.nextLong();
        long ans = help(K,A,B);
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
    static long help(long K, long A, long B){
        if(A<=B) return A>=K?1:-1;
        if(A>=K) return 1;
        long dif = (A-B);
        long t = (K-A)/dif+((K-A)%dif==0?0:1);
        return 2*t+1;
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4000 2000 500
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4000, 2000 and
