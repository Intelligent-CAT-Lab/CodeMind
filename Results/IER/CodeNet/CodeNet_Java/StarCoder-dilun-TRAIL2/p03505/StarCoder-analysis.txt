he variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4000, 2000 and 500 respectively according to the input.
The function help is called with the values of variables K, A and B as parameters.
Inside the function, it checks if A is less than or equal to B. If it is, it checks if A is greater than or equal to K. If it is, it returns 1.
If it is not, it checks if A is greater than or equal to K. If it is, it returns 1.
If it is not, it calculates the difference between A and B.
Then it calculates the quotient of K minus A and the difference between A and B.
Then it calculates the sum of the product of 2 and the quotient of K minus A and the difference between A and B.
Then it returns the final value of the sum as output.
