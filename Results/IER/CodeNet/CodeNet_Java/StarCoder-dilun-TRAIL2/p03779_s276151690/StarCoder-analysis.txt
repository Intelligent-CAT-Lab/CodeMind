he variable n is initialized with 6.
The variable x is initialized with 0.
The variable i is initialized with 1.
The while loop runs until the value of variable x is greater than or equal to variable n.
Inside the while loop, it adds the value of variable i to variable x.
Then it increments the value of variable i by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable i-1 as output, which is 5.
