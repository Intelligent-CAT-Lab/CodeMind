he variable n is initialized with 6.
The variable x is initialized with 0.
The variable i is initialized with 1.
The while loop runs until the value of variable x is greater than or equal to variable n.
Inside the while loop, it adds the value of variable i to variable x.
Then it increments the value of variable i by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable i-1 as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		long n=sc.nextLong();
		long x=0;
		long i=1;
		while(x<n)
		{
			x+=i;
			i++;
		}
		System.out.println(i-1);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
