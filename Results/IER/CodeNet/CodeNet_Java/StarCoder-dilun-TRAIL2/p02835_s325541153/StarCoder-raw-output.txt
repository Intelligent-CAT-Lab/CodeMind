he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 5, 7 and 9 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of the three variables is greater than or equal to 22. If it is, it prints "bust" as output. Otherwise, it prints "win" as output.
<<<Output>>>
win
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int  a = sc.nextInt();
		int  b = sc.nextInt();
		int  c = sc.nextInt();
		
		if ((a+b+c)>=22){
			System.out.print("bust");
		}else{
			System.out.print("win");
		}
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
