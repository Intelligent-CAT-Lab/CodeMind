he variable S is initialized with the input string "hihi".
It checks if the length of the string S is odd. If it is, it sets the variable ans to "No".
If the length of the string S is even, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to half of the length of the string S.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the substring of S starting from index i and ending at index i+2 is equal to "hi". If it is not, it sets the variable ans to "No".
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is "Yes".
