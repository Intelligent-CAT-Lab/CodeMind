variable e is initialized with a LinkedList of 12 integers.
It enters a for loop and it iterates 12 times to add 12 integers to the LinkedList e.
It then checks if the number of distinct elements in the LinkedList e is greater than 3. If it is, it prints "no" as output and returns.
If the number of distinct elements in the LinkedList e is not greater than 3, it sorts the LinkedList e in ascending order.
It then gets the distinct elements in the LinkedList e and stores them in the variable disinct.
It then enters a for loop and it iterates through the array disinct to check if the number of each distinct element in the LinkedList e is 4, 8 or 12.
If it is not, it prints "no" as output and returns.
If it is, it prints "yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
yes
