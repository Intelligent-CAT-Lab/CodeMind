e variable s is initialized with the string "aabbaa". The variable n is initialized with the length of the string s. The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each character c in the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it increments variable count by 1. Then it checks if the current character c is equal to the next character c+1. If it is, it increments variable i by 2 and increments variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 4.
