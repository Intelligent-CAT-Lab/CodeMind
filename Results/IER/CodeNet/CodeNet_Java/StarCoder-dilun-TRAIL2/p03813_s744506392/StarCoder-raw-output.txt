he variable x is initialized with 1000 according to the input.
It checks if x is less than 1200. If it is, it prints "ABC" as output.
If it is not, it prints "ARC" as output.
<<<Output>>>
ARC
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x = sc.nextInt();
		if(x<1200) {
			System.out.println("ABC");
		}else {
			System.out.println("ARC");
		}
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
