e variable input is initialized with the string "0ig3he12fz99".
The variable alpha_count is initialized with an array of 26 elements, each of which is initialized with 0.
The variable number_count is initialized with an array of 10 elements, each of which is initialized with 0.
The variable length is initialized with the length of the string "0ig3he12fz99".
The variable length is decreased by the value returned by the compress method when it is called with the array alpha_count as argument.
The variable length is decreased by the value returned by the compress method when it is called with the array number_count as argument.
The value of variable length is printed as output.
