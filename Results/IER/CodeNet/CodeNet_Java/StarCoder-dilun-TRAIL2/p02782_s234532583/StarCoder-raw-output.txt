he variable r1, c1, r2 and c2 are initialized with 1, 1, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable mod is initialized with 1000000007.
The array p is initialized with 2000003 elements.
The array pi is initialized with 2000003 elements.
The value of variable v1 is calculated by calling the function nCr with parameters r2 + c2 + 2, r2 + 1, mod, p, pi.
The value of variable v2 is calculated by calling the function nCr with parameters r1 + c2 + 1, r1, mod, p, pi.
The value of variable v3 is calculated by calling the function nCr with parameters r2 + c1 + 1, c1, mod, p, pi.
The value of variable v4 is calculated by calling the function nCr with parameters r1 + c1, r1, mod, p, pi.
The value of variable ans is calculated by subtracting v1 from v2, v3 and adding v4.
The value of variable ans is then modded by mod.
The value of variable ans is then printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		sc.close();

		int mod = 1000000007;
		long[] p = new long[2000003];
		long[] pi = new long[2000003];
		p[0] = 1;
		pi[0] = 1;
		for (int i = 1; i < p.length; i++) {
			p[i] = p[i - 1] * i % mod;
			pi[i] = modinv(p[i], mod);
		}

		long ans = 0;
