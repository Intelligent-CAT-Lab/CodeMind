he variable N is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable pow.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i with variable pow and stores the result in variable pow.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable pow as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	static long MOD = 1000000007;
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		long pow =1;

		for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
			pow = pow * i % MOD;
		}

		System.out.println(pow);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable pow.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i with variable pow and stores the result in variable pow.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable pow as output, which is 24.
<<<Output>>>
24
