TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
   public static void main(String[]args){

      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int a = sc.nextInt();
      int b = sc.nextInt();

      System.out.println(a*b+" "+2*(a+b));

   }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
