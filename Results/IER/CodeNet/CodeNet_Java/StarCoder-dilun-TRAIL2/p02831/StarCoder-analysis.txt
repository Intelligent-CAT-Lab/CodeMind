he variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the maximum of A and B to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of both A and B. If it is, it updates the value of variable gcd to i.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the lcm of A and B by dividing the product of A and B by the value of variable gcd.
It then print the fianl value of variable lcm as output, which is 6.
