he variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the maximum of A and B to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of both A and B. If it is, it updates the value of variable gcd to i.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the lcm of A and B by dividing the product of A and B by the value of variable gcd.
It then print the fianl value of variable lcm as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[N];
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		sc.close();

		int max = arr[0];
		for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
			if (arr[i] > max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max);
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5

```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It creates an array of size N and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is greater than the value of variable max. If it is, it
