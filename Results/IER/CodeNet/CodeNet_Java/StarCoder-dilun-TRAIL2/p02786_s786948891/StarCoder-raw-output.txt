he variable h is initialized with 2.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable h is greater than or equal to the value of variable t.
Inside the while loop, it adds the value of variable t to variable ans.
Then it doubles the value of variable t.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		int ans=0;
		for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
			ans+=i;
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
