he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the product of a and 10 plus b plus c is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the product of a and 10 plus b plus c.
It checks if the sum of a plus b and 10 plus c is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the sum of a plus b and 10 plus c.
It checks if the sum of a plus b plus c and 10 is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the sum of a plus b plus c and 10.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 152.
