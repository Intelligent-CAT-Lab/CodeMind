he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the product of a and 10 plus b plus c is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the product of a and 10 plus b plus c.
It checks if the sum of a plus b and 10 plus c is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the sum of a plus b and 10 plus c.
It checks if the sum of a plus b plus c and 10 is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the sum of a plus b plus c and 10.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 152.
<<<Output>>>
152

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[]args){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

		int a=sc.nextInt();
		int b=sc.nextInt();
		int c=sc.nextInt();
		int max=0;

		if(a*10+b+c>max){
			max=a*10+b+c;
		}
		if(a+b*10+c>max){
			max=a+b*10+c;
		}
		if(a+b+c*10>max){
			max=a+b+c*10;
		}
		System.out.println(max);


	}

}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 5 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if
