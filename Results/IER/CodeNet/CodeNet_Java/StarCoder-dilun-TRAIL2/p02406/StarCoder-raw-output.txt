he variable x is initialized with 30.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 29 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable count.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable b by dividing variable a by 10.
Then it checks if the remainder of the division of variable a by 3 is 0. If it is, it appends a space and the value of variable a to the string builder sb.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable b by dividing variable a by 10.
Then it enters a while loop and it iterates until variable b is 0. The value of variable b is also passed to variable count.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the remainder of the division of variable b by 10 is 3. If it is, it appends a space and the value of variable a to the string builder sb.
Otherwise, it divides variable b by 10 again.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of string builder sb as output, which is 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27.
<<<Output>>>
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27
