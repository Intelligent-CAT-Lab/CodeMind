e variable w is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string w. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of times the character a occurs in the string w by accessing the array list at index a.
Then it checks if the number of times the character a occurs in the string w is even. If it is, it prints "No" as output.
If the number of times the character a occurs in the string w is odd, it prints "Yes" as output.
