e variable w is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string w. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of times the character a occurs in the string w by accessing the array list at index a.
Then it checks if the number of times the character a occurs in the string w is even. If it is, it prints "No" as output.
If the number of times the character a occurs in the string w is odd, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        PrintStream out = new PrintStream(System.out);
        String w;
        int list[] = new int[26];

        w = sc.nextLine();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < w.length(); i++) {
            //char a=97 b=122
            list[w.charAt(i) - 97]++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if(list[i]%2!= 0) {
                out.println("No");

                sc.close();
                return;
            }
        }

        out.println("Yes");
        sc.close();
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abaccaba
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
