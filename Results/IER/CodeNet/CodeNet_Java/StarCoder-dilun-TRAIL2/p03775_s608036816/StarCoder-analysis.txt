he variable num is initialized with 10000.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of variable num. If it is, it calculates the quotient and remainder of the division of variable num by i.
Then it checks if the quotient is greater than 0 and the remainder is 0. If it is, it concatenates the string representation of the quotient and the string representation of the remainder to variable s.
Then it concatenates the string representation of the current interger i to variable str.
Then it calculates the maximum length of the string representations of the quotient and the remainder by comparing the length of the string representations of the quotient and the remainder with the current maximum length.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 4.
