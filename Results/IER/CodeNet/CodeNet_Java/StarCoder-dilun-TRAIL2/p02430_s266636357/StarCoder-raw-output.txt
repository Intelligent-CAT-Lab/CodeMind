 variable n is initialized with 5 and variable k is initialized with 3.
The variable a is initialized with an array of size 5.
The variable pow is initialized with the value of 2^5, which is 32.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 31.
Inside the for loop, variable m is initialized with the current interger i.
The variable counter is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 4.
Inside the for loop, variable j is initialized with the current interger j.
The if statement checks if m is odd. If it is, it sets the value of a[j] to 1 and increments the value of counter by 1.
If the if statement is not true, it sets the value of a[j] to 0.
After the for loop finishes, it checks if the value of counter is equal to k. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration of the for loop.
If the value of counter is equal to k, it prints the current interger i and the array a.
