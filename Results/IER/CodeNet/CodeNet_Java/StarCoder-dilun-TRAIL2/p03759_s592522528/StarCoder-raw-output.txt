he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 4 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the difference between variable b and variable a is equal to the difference between variable c and variable b.
If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		if(a + b == c) {
			System.out.println("YES");
		}else{
			System.out.println("NO");
		}
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 4 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
