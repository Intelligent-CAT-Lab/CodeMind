he variable s is initialized with 7.
The variable dp is initialized with an array of size 8. The first element of the array is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 3 to 7 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the sum of i and j is less than or equal to s. If it is, it adds the value of dp[i] to dp[i+j] and modulos it with mod.
After the second for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of dp[s] as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    static int mod = 1_000_000_007;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= arr[i]; j++) {
                if(arr[i] < i + j) break;
                dp[i+j] = (dp[i+j] + dp[i]) %mod;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(dp[n-1]);
        sc.close();

    }

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
