he variable s is initialized with 7.
The variable dp is initialized with an array of size 8. The first element of the array is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 3 to 7 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the sum of i and j is less than or equal to s. If it is, it adds the value of dp[i] to dp[i+j] and modulos it with mod.
After the second for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of dp[s] as output, which is 10.
