he variable x is initialized with 6.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the current value of variable count is greater than or equal to variable x.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of the current interger count by multiplying it with (count + 1) and dividing it by 2.
Then it checks if the calculated value of count is greater than or equal to variable x.
If it is, it prints the value of variable count as output.
