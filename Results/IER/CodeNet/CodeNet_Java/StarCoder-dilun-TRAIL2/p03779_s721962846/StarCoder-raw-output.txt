he variable x is initialized with 6.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the current value of variable count is greater than or equal to variable x.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of the current interger count by multiplying it with (count + 1) and dividing it by 2.
Then it checks if the calculated value of count is greater than or equal to variable x.
If it is, it prints the value of variable count as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x = sc.nextInt();
		int count = 1;
		while (true) {
		    int d = count * (count + 1) / 2;
		    if (d >= x) {
		        System.out.println(count);
		        return;
		    }
		    count++;
		}
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
