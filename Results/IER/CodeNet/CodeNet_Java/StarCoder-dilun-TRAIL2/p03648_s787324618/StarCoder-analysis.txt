variable K is initialized with 0.
The variable N is initialized with 50.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 49 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable r by subtracting 1 from variable N, subtracting i from variable N, adding K/N to variable r, and adding 1 to variable r if K%N is greater than i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable r as output, which is 49.
