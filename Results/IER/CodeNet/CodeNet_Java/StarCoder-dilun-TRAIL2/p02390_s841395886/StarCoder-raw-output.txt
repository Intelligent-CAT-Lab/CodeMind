he variable S is initialized with 46979.
The variable h is initialized with S divided by 3600.
The variable m is initialized with (S - h * 3600) divided by 60.
The variable s is initialized with S - (h * 3600 + m * 60).
After the initialization, it prints the value of variables h, m and s as output, which is 1:15:59.
<<<Output>>>
1:15:59

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

		int h, m, s;

		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		int S = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());

		h = S / 3600;
		m = (S - h * 3600) / 60;
		s = S - (h * 3600 + m * 60);

		System.out.println(h + ":" + m + ":" + s );
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```46979
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with 46979.
