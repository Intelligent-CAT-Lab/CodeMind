e variable k is initialized with 4.
The variable N is initialized with the integer part of the square root of 8k + 1.
The variable missing is initialized with 0.
The variable j is initialized with 1.
The if statement checks if N(N + 1)/2 < k.
If it is true, then the variable missing is set to (N + 1)(N + 2)/2 - k.
The variable N is incremented by 1.
The if statement checks if j!= missing.
If it is true, then the current value of j is printed as output.
