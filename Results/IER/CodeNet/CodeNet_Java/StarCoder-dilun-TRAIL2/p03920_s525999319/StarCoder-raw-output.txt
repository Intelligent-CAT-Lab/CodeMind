e variable k is initialized with 4.
The variable N is initialized with the integer part of the square root of 8k + 1.
The variable missing is initialized with 0.
The variable j is initialized with 1.
The if statement checks if N(N + 1)/2 < k.
If it is true, then the variable missing is set to (N + 1)(N + 2)/2 - k.
The variable N is incremented by 1.
The if statement checks if j!= missing.
If it is true, then the current value of j is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		int n = Integer.parseInt(reader.readLine());
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = Integer.parseInt(reader.readLine());
		}
		int[] dp = new int[n];
		dp[0] = arr[0];
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1] + arr[i], arr[i]);
		}
		System.out.println(dp[n-1]);
	}
	
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
The array arr is initialized with 5 elements.
The array dp is initialized with 5 elements.
The variable i is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 4.
Inside the for loop, the current value of i is passed to variable dp.
The
