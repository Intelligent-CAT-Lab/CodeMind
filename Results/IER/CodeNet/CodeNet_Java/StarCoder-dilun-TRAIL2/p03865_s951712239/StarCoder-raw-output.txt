e variable S is initialized with the input string "aba".
The variable even is initialized with the boolean value of (S.length % 2 == 0).
The variable match is initialized with the boolean value of (S[0] == S[S.length - 1]).
The output is "Second" if the value of variable even is true and the value of variable match is false.
The output is "First" if the value of variable even is false and the value of variable match is true.
<<<Output>>>
Second

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    int[] arr = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
    }
    int max = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      if (arr[i] > max) {
        max = arr[i];
      }
    }
    System.out.println(max);
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer 5.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of length n.
The variable max is initialized with the value of the first element of the array arr.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of arr[i] is greater than the value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the value of arr[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
