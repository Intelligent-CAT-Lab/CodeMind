he variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 1 to 2. The value of variable n is also passed to variable num.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current interger num is greater than 1. If it is, it subtracts 1 from variable n.
Then it enters a while loop and it iterates from 1 to 3. The value of variable m is also passed to variable num.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current interger num is greater than 1. If it is, it subtracts 1 from variable m.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 99.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 99.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the current interger i is less than 50. If it is, it assigns character # to the current position of the array a.
Otherwise, it assigns character. to the current position of the array a.
After the inner for loop finishes, it enters another while loop and it iterates from 0 to 99.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current interger i is less than 50. If it is, it assigns character # to the current position of the array a.
Otherwise, it assigns character. to the current position of the array a.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final array a as output.
