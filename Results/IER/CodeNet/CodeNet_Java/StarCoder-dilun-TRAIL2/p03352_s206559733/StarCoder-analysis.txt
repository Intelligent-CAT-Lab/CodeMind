he variable X is initialized with 10.
The variable a is initialized with 1.
The variable i is initialized with 2.
The variable array is initialized with 1000 elements.
The variable index is initialized with 0.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the value of variable a is greater than the value of variable X. If it is, the while loop is exited.
The for loop is entered and it iterates from variable a to variable X to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable array[index].
The value of variable index is incremented by 1.
The for loop finishes and the while loop is entered again.
The value of variable i is incremented by 1.
The while loop finishes and the for loop is exited.
The array is sorted in ascending order and the 1000th element of the array is printed as output.
