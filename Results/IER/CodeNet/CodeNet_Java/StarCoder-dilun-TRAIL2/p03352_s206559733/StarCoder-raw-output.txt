he variable X is initialized with 10.
The variable a is initialized with 1.
The variable i is initialized with 2.
The variable array is initialized with 1000 elements.
The variable index is initialized with 0.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the value of variable a is greater than the value of variable X. If it is, the while loop is exited.
The for loop is entered and it iterates from variable a to variable X to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable array[index].
The value of variable index is incremented by 1.
The for loop finishes and the while loop is entered again.
The value of variable i is incremented by 1.
The while loop finishes and the for loop is exited.
The array is sorted in ascending order and the 1000th element of the array is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int N = sc.nextInt();

		int[] array = new int[N];

		for(int i=0;i<N;i++) {

			array[i] = sc.nextInt();

		}

		int[] array2 = new int[N];

		for(int i=0;i<N;i++) {

			array2[i] = array[N-1-i];

		}

		for(int i=0;i<N;i++) {

			System.out.println(array2[i]);

		}
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5.
The variable array is initialized with 5 elements.
The for loop is entered and it iterates from 0 to 4
