he variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the new value of variable money by multiplying it with 1.05.
Then it checks if the calculated variable money is divisible by 1000. If it is, it adds 1 to the integer part of the variable money and multiplies it with 1000.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable money as output, which is 110000.
<<<Output>>>
110000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;

class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
		BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String s=r.readLine();
		int n = Integer.parseInt(s);
		int money=100000;
		try {
			for(;n>0;n--){
				money*=1.05;
				if (money%1000>0){
					money = ((money/1000)+1)*1000;
				}
			}
			System.out.println(money);
		} catch (Exception err) {
			System.exit(0);
		}
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the new value of variable money by multiplying it with 1.05.
Then it checks if the calculated variable money is divisible by 1000. If it is, it adds 1 to the integer part of the variable money and multiplies it with
