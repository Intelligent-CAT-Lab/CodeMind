he variable str is initialized with the input.
It creates a HashMap object and initializes it with a key-value pair of "Sunny" and "Cloudy", "Cloudy" and "Rainy" and "Rainy" and "Sunny" respectively.
It then uses the get method to get the value of the key str.
<<<Output>>>
Cloudy

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		try (Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in)) {
          int n = scan.nextInt();
          int a = scan.nextInt();
          int b = scan.nextInt();
          
          int sum = 0;
          int answer = 0;
          
          for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
              int num = i;
              int sum1 = 0;
              
              while (num!= 0) {
                  sum1 += num % 10;
                  num /= 10;
              }
              
              if (sum1 >= a && sum1 <= b ) {
                  answer = answer + i;
              }
          }
          System.out.println(answer);
        }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is
