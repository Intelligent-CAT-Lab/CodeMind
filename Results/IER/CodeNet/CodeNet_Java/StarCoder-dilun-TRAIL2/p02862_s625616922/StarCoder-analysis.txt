e variable x and variable y are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
Then it checks if (x+y)%3 is not equal to 0. If it is not, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable n as (x+y)/3.
Then it calculates the value of variable x as x-n.
Then it calculates the value of variable y as y-n.
Then it checks if x<0 or y<0. If it is true, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable top as (x+y) and the value of variable bottom as 1.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to r, which is x+y.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable top as top*n and the value of variable bottom as bottom*i.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of variable bottom as modPow(bottom, mod-2, mod).
Then it prints the final value of variable top*bottom as output.
