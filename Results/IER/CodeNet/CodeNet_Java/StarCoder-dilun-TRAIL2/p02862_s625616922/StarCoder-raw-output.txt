e variable x and variable y are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
Then it checks if (x+y)%3 is not equal to 0. If it is not, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable n as (x+y)/3.
Then it calculates the value of variable x as x-n.
Then it calculates the value of variable y as y-n.
Then it checks if x<0 or y<0. If it is true, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable top as (x+y) and the value of variable bottom as 1.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to r, which is x+y.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable top as top*n and the value of variable bottom as bottom*i.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of variable bottom as modPow(bottom, mod-2, mod).
Then it prints the final value of variable top*bottom as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.awt.Point;

	static int mod = 1000000007;
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long x = sc.nextLong();
		long y = sc.nextLong();
		if((x+y)%3!= 0) {
			System.out.println(0);
			return;
		}
		long n = (x+y)/3;
		x = x-n;
		y = y-n;
		if(x<0 || y<0) {
			System.out.println(0);
			return;
		}
		System.out.println(modCombination(x+y, x, mod));
	}
	public static long modCombination(long n, long r, long mod) {
		long top = 1;
		long bottom = 1;
		for (int i = 1; i <= r; i++)
