he variable n is initialized with 30.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 30 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by 3. If it is, it appends the current interger i to variable count.
If it is not, it enters a do-while loop and it iterates until x is 0. Inside the do-while loop, it checks if the last digit of the current interger i is 3. If it is, it appends the current interger i to variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3 13 23 33 113 123 133 213 223 233 313 323 333.
