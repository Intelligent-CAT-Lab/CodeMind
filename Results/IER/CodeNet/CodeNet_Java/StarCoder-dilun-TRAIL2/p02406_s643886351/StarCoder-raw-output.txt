he variable n is initialized with 30.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 30 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by 3. If it is, it appends the current interger i to variable count.
If it is not, it enters a do-while loop and it iterates until x is 0. Inside the do-while loop, it checks if the last digit of the current interger i is 3. If it is, it appends the current interger i to variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3 13 23 33 113 123 133 213 223 233 313 323 333.
<<<Output>>>
3 13 23 33 113 123 133 213 223 233 313 323 333

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	 public static void main(String[] args) {
	        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	        int n=sc.nextInt();
	        int count=0;
	        for (int i=1;i<=n;i++){
	            int x=i;
	            if (x%3==0){
	                count++;
	                continue;}
	            do{
	                if(x%10==3){
	                    count++;
	                    break;}
	                x/=10;
	            }while(x!=0);
	        }
	        System.out.println(count);
	    }
	}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```30
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 30.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from
