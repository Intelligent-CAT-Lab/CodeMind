he variable input is initialized with the input string.
The variable valueset is initialized with the input string splitted into an array of strings.
The if statement checks if the second and third characters of the input string are equal. If they are, it checks if the first and second characters are equal or if the second and fourth characters are equal.
If the if statement is true, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{

	public static void main(String[] args){
    	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
      
      	int n=sc.nextInt();
      
      	int[] arr=new int[n];
      
      	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        	arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
        }
      
      	int max=arr[0];
      
      	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        	if(arr[i]>max){
          		max=arr[i];
          }
        }
      
      	System.out.println(max);
    }	
  
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of n integers.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n-1 to initialize the array with the input integers.
The variable max is initialized with the first element of the array.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n-1 to check if the current element of the array is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the current element of the array.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable max as output.
<<<Output>>>
5
