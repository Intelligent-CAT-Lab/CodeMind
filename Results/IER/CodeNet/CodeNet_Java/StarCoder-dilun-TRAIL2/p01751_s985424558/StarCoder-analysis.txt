he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 10, 10 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 60 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable x by adding variable i to variable c.
Then it enters a while loop and it iterates until variable x is less than or equal to variable y. The value of variable y is also passed to variable x.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable x by subtracting variable y from variable x.
Then it checks if the calculated variable x falls within the range [1, 10]. If it does, it prints the value of variable x as output. The condition is met when x is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 10.
After the loop finishes, it checks if variable flag is true. If it is true, it prints -1 as output.
