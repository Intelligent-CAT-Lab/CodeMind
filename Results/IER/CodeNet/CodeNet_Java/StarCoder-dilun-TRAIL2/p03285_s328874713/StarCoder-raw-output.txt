he variable N is initialized with 11.
It checks if N is divisible by 4 or 7. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
If it is not, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 4 to N-1 by adding 4 to i.
Inside the for loop, it checks if (N-i) is divisible by 7. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
If it is not, it breaks out of the loop and prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int a[] = new int[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) a[i] = sc.nextInt();
        int max = a[0];
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++) if(a[i]>max) max = a[i];
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) if(a[i]==max) count++;
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to initialize each element of the array with the value of the corresponding input.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each element of the array.
If the current element is greater than the variable max, it updates the variable max with the current element.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each element of the array.
If the current element
