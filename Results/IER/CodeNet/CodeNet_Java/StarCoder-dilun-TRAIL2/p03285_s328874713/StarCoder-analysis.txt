he variable N is initialized with 11.
It checks if N is divisible by 4 or 7. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
If it is not, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 4 to N-1 by adding 4 to i.
Inside the for loop, it checks if (N-i) is divisible by 7. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
If it is not, it breaks out of the loop and prints "No" as output.
