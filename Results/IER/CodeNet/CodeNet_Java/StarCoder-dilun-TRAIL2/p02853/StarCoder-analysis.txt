he variable X and variable Y are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It checks if X and Y are equal to 1. If they are, it sets the value of variable ans to 1000000.
If they are not equal to 1, it checks if X is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 300000 to the value of variable ans.
It checks if Y is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 300000 to the value of variable ans.
It checks if X is equal to 2. If it is, it adds 200000 to the value of variable ans.
It checks if Y is equal to 2. If it is, it adds 200000 to the value of variable ans.
It checks if X is equal to 3. If it is, it adds 100000 to the value of variable ans.
It checks if Y is equal to 3. If it is, it adds 100000 to the value of variable ans.
After the checks, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 1000000.
