he variable X and variable Y are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It checks if X and Y are equal to 1. If they are, it sets the value of variable ans to 1000000.
If they are not equal to 1, it checks if X is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 300000 to the value of variable ans.
It checks if Y is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 300000 to the value of variable ans.
It checks if X is equal to 2. If it is, it adds 200000 to the value of variable ans.
It checks if Y is equal to 2. If it is, it adds 200000 to the value of variable ans.
It checks if X is equal to 3. If it is, it adds 100000 to the value of variable ans.
It checks if Y is equal to 3. If it is, it adds 100000 to the value of variable ans.
After the checks, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 1000000.
<<<Output>>>
1000000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0) {
                ans += i;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10
