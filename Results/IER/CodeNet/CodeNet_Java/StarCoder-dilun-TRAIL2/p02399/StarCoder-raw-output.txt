he variable a is initialized with 3 and variable b is initialized with 2.
The integer division of variable a by variable b is calculated and stored in variable d.
The remainder of the integer division of variable a by variable b is calculated and stored in variable r.
The floating point division of variable a by variable b is calculated and stored in variable f.
The output is formatted as a string and printed.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		
		sc.close();
		
		int d = a/b;
		int r = a%b;
		String f = String.format("%.5f",  1.0 * a / b);
		
		System.out.printf("%d %d %s", d, r, f);
		
	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
