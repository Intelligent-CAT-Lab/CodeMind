he variable A is initialized with 4 and variable B is initialized with 6.
The for loop iterates from B+1 to infinity.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the values of variables ca and cb.
The value of variable ca is calculated by dividing i by A and adding the remainder of i divided by A.
The value of variable cb is calculated by dividing i by B, adding the remainder of i divided by A and adding the remainder of the remainder of i divided by A.
If the value of variable ca is less than the value of variable cb, it prints the value of variable i as output and returns.
If the for loop finishes without printing the value of variable i, it prints -1 as output.
