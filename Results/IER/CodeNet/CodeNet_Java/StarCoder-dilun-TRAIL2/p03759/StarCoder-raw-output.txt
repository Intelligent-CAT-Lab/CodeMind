he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 4 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the difference between a and b is equal to the difference between b and c.
If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
If it is not, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
NO

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int c = sc.nextInt();
    if (a+b == b+c) {
      System.out.println("YES");
    } else {
      System.out.println("NO");
    }
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 4 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 4 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of a and b is equal to the sum of b and c.
If it is, it prints "YES" as output.
If it is not, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES
