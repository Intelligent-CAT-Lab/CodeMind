he variable n is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i*i equals to n. If it does, it prints the value of (i-1)*2 as output.
If it does not, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of n.
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it does, it prints the value of i-1+(n/i)-1 as output.
If it does not, it enters another for loop and it iterates from the square root of n to 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it does, it prints the value of i-1+(n/i)-1 as output.
