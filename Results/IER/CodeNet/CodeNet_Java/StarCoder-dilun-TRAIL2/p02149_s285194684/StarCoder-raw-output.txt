e variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1000, 900 and 850 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with an empty string.
It checks if a is greater than b and a is greater than c. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to "A".
It checks if b is greater than a and b is greater than c. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to "B".
It checks if c is greater than a and c is greater than b. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to "C".
After the checks, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is "A".
<<<Output>>>
A
