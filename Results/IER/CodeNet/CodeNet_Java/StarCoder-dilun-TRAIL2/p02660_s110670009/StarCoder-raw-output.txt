e variable N is initialized with 24.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to infinity to check each integer e in this range. The value of variable e is also passed to variable div.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable div by raising the value of variable q to the power of e.
Then it checks if the value of variable N is divisible by the value of variable div. If it is, it divides the value of variable N by the value of variable div and adds 1 to the value of variable ans.
If the value of variable N is not divisible by the value of variable div, it enters a while loop and it iterates from 1 to infinity to check each integer q in this range. The value of variable q is also passed to variable div.
Inside the while loop, it divides the value of variable N by the value of variable q.
Then it checks if the value of variable N is divisible by the value of variable q. If it is, it divides the value of variable N by the value of variable q.
If the value of variable N is not divisible by the value of variable q, it breaks out of the while loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable N is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 1 to the value of variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
