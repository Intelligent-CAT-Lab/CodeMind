he variable n, variable m and variable d are initialized with 2, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable v2 by subtracting the maximum of 0 and the sum of n, d and d.
If d is 0, then v2 is 0.
Then it calculates the value of variable v1 by subtracting the value of variable v2 from n.
Then it prints the value of variable v2 multiplied by 2 plus the value of variable v1, multiplied by m minus 1, divided by n to the power of 2.
