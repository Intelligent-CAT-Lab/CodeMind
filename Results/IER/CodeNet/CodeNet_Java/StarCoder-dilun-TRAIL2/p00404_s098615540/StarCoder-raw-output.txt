he variable x and variable y are initialized with 0 and 0 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to infinity.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the rectangle contains the point (x, y).
If it does, it prints the value of i mod 3 plus 1 as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1] + arr[i], arr[i]);
        }
        System.out.println(dp[n - 1]);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the value of dp[i] with the value of arr[i].
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n - 1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum value of dp[i - 1] plus arr[i] and arr[i] and assigns it to dp[i].
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of dp[n - 1] as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
