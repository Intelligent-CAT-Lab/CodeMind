he variable str is initialized with the input.
The variable size is initialized with the length of the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to size-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the input is equal to the previous character of the input. If it is, it prints the value of i and i+1 as output.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to size-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the input is equal to the previous previous character of the input. If it is, it prints the value of i-1 and i+1 as output.
After the loop finishes, it prints -1 and -1 as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	
		String str = sc.nextLine();
		
		sc.close();
		
		int size = str.length();
		
		for(int i = 0 ; i < size ; i++){
			if(str.charAt(i) == 'a'){
				System.out.println(i);
				System.exit(0);
			}
		}
		
		System.out.println(-1);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abacaba
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
