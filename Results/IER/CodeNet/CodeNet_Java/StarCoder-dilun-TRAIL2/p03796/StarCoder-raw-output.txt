he variable cnt is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable power.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the power of the current interger i by repeatedlly multiplying it with variable power.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable power as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int max = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > max) {
                max = arr[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the array arr with 5 elements.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
