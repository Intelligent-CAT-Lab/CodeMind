he variable n is initialized with 8.
The variable nishin is initialized with the binary representation of n.
The variable c is initialized with the character array of nishin.
The variable start is initialized with 32 - nishin.length().
The for loop iterates from 0 to 32.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is less than start. If it is, it prints 0.
If it is not, it checks if the character at index i - start of the character array c is 1. If it is, it prints 1. If it is not, it prints 0.

Inside the for loop, it checks if i is less than start. If it is, it prints 1.
If it is not, it checks if the character at index i - start of the character array c is 1. If it is, it prints 0. If it is not, it prints 1.
The for loop iterates from 1 to 32.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is less than start. If it is, it prints 0.
If it is not, it checks if the character at index i - start of the character array c is 1. If it is, it prints 1. If it is not, it prints 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 31.
