he variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
  public static void main(String...args) {
    final Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    final int N = sc.nextInt();
    final int A = sc.nextInt();
    final int B = sc.nextInt();
    int ans = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
      int sum = 0;
      for(int j = i; j > 0; j /= 10)
        sum += j % 10;
      if(A <= sum && sum <= B)
        ans += i;
    }
    System.out.println(ans);
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
