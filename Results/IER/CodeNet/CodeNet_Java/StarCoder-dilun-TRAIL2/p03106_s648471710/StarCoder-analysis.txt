he variable a and variable b are initialized with 8 and 12 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 2.
It calculates the smaller of the two variables a and b.
It initializes an array of integers with size smaller+1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to smaller to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable divisors[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if a is divisible by i and b is divisible by i. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable divisors[i].
After the loop finishes, it sorts the array of integers in descending order.
It prints the kth element of the array of integers as output, which is 12.
