he variable x is initialized with 3 and variable a is initialized with 5.
The if statement checks if x is less than a. Since x is 3 and a is 5, the condition is met and the output is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

      int x=sc.nextInt();
      int a=sc.nextInt();

      if(x<a){
          System.out.println("0");
      }
      else{
        System.out.println("10");
      }

    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 5 and variable a is initialized with 3.
The if statement checks if x is less than a. Since x is 5 and a is 3, the condition is not met and the output is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
