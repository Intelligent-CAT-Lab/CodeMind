he variable s is initialized with 19.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sub.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable a and variable b by dividing the sum of the first i digits of variable s with 2 and the sum of the remaining digits of variable s with 2.
Then it checks if the calculated variables a and b are both positive and if the sum of the absolute values of a and b is equal to the integer value of variable s.
If the condition is met, it adds the calculated values of a and b to a HashSet.
After the loop finishes, it print the size of the HashSet as output, which is 1.
