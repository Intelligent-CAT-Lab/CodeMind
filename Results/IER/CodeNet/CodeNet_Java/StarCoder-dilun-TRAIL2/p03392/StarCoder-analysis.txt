NO-ANSWER
e variable s is initialized with the input string "abc".
The variable n is initialized with the length of the input string.
The variable abc is initialized with a set of strings "abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab" and "cba".
The variable diff is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the input string s at index i is not equal to the current character of the input string s at index i+1. If it is not, it increments variable diff by 1.
Then it checks if the length of the input string s is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it checks if the current character of the input string s at index 0 is equal to the current character of the input string s at index 1. If it is, it prints 1 as output. Otherwise, it prints 2 as output.
Then it checks if the input string s is in the set of strings abc. If it is, it prints 3 as output.
Then it checks if the value of variable diff is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
Then it enters a nested if-else statement.
If the length of the input string s is greater than or equal to 3, it enters a nested if-else statement.
