he variable arr is initialized with the string "BBW".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each character c in this range. The value of variable c is also passed to variable arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'B'. If it is, it increments variable blackCount by 1.
Otherwise, it adds the current value of variable blackCount to variable count. The condition is met when c is 'W'.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
