he variable arr is initialized with the string "BBW".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each character c in this range. The value of variable c is also passed to variable arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'B'. If it is, it increments variable blackCount by 1.
Otherwise, it adds the current value of variable blackCount to variable count. The condition is met when c is 'W'.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int max = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > max) {
                max = arr[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
It creates an array of size 5 and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the current integer i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
