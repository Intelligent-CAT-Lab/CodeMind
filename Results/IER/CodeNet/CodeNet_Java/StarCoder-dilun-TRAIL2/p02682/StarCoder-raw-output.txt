he variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 2, 1, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It checks if the value of variable d is less than or equal to the value of variable a. If it is, it prints the value of variable d and returns.
If it is not, it adds the value of variable a to variable sum and subtracts the value of variable d from variable d.
It checks if the value of variable d is less than or equal to the value of variable b. If it is, it prints the value of variable sum and returns.
If it is not, it subtracts the value of variable d from variable d and subtracts the value of variable d from variable sum.
It prints the value of variable sum as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = scan.nextInt();
    int b = scan.nextInt();
    int c = scan.nextInt();
    int d = scan.nextInt();
    int sum = 0;
    if (d<=a){
      System.out.println(d);
      return;
    }
    sum = a;
    d -= a;
    if(d<=b){
      System.out.println(sum);
      return;
    }
    d-=b;
    sum -= d;
    System.out.println(sum);
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1 1 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
