he variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 2, 1, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It checks if the value of variable d is less than or equal to the value of variable a. If it is, it prints the value of variable d and returns.
If it is not, it adds the value of variable a to variable sum and subtracts the value of variable d from variable d.
It checks if the value of variable d is less than or equal to the value of variable b. If it is, it prints the value of variable sum and returns.
If it is not, it subtracts the value of variable d from variable d and subtracts the value of variable d from variable sum.
It prints the value of variable sum as output.
