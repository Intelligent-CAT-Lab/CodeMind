variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of variable s is not equal to the character at index j-1 of variable s. If it is not, it breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is met, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of variable s is not equal to the character at index j-1 of variable s. If it is not, it breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is met, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 3 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of variable s is not equal to the character at index j-1 of variable s. If it is not, it breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is met, it prints "Yes" as output.
If the condition is not met, it prints "No" as output.
