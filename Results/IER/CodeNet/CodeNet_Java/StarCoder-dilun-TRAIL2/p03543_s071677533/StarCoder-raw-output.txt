 variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of variable s is not equal to the character at index j-1 of variable s. If it is not, it breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is met, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of variable s is not equal to the character at index j-1 of variable s. If it is not, it breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is met, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 3 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of variable s is not equal to the character at index j-1 of variable s. If it is not, it breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is met, it prints "Yes" as output.
If the condition is not met, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{

  public static void main(String[] args){
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      String s = sc.next();
      int count = 0;
      for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if(s.charAt(i) == 'a')
          count++;
      }
      System.out.println(count);
  }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abacaba
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable
