he variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input.
The value of variable N is added to 1 and then divided by 2.
The final value of variable N is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int N = sc.nextInt();
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
      sum += i;
    }
    System.out.printf("%d", sum);
    sc.close();
    return;
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is added to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
