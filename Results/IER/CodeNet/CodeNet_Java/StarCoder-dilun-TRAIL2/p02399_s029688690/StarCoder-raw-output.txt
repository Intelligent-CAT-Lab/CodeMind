he variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable d is initialized with the integer division of variable a and variable b.
The variable r is initialized with the remainder of variable a and variable b.
The variable f is initialized with the floating point division of variable a and variable b.
The output is the value of variables d, r and f, which are 1, 1 and 1.50000 respectively.
<<<Output>>>
1 1 1.50000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a,b;
		int d,r;
		double f;

		a = sc.nextInt();
		b = sc.nextInt();

		d = a/b;
		r =a%b;
		f = (double)a/(double)b;

		System.out.print(d+" "+r+" ");
		System.out.println(String.format("%.5f", f));


		sc.close();
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 10 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable d is initialized with the integer division of variable a and variable b.
The variable r is initialized with the remainder of variable a and variable b.
The variable f is initialized with the floating point division of variable a and variable b.
The output is the value of variables d, r and f, which are 3, 1 and 3.33333 respectively.
<<<Output>>>
3 1 3.33333
