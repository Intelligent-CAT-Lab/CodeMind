he variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable d is initialized with the integer division of variable a and variable b.
The variable r is initialized with the remainder of variable a and variable b.
The variable f is initialized with the floating point division of variable a and variable b.
The output is the value of variables d, r and f, which are 1, 1 and 1.50000 respectively.
