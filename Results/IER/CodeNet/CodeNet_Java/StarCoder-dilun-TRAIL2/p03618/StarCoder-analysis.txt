he variable A is initialized with the string "aatt". The variable N is initialized with the length of the string "aatt", which is 5.
The variable cnt is initialized with an array of 26 elements.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 4 to check each character in the string A. The value of the current character is passed to the variable i.
Inside the for loop, it increments the value of cnt[i-97] by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop to check each element in the array cnt.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of cnt[i] is greater than 0. If it is, it subtracts the value of cnt[i]*(cnt[i]+1)/2 from variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
