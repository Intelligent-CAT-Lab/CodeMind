he variable n is initialized with 7 and variable k is initialized with 4.
The variable ans is initialized with the value of variable n.
The variable num is initialized with the remainder of variable n divided by variable k.
The variable num2 is initialized with 0.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the value of variable num is less than 0.
If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it calculates the absolute value of variable num and stores it in variable num2.
Then it checks if the value of variable num2 is less than the value of variable ans.
If it is, it updates the value of variable ans with the value of variable num2.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		long n = sc.nextLong();
		long k = sc.nextLong();
		long ans = n;
		long num = n % k;
		long num2 = 0;

		while(true) {
			num2 = Math.abs(num);
			ans = Math.min(ans, num2);
			if(num < 0) {
				break;
			}
			num = num -k;
		}
		
		System.out.println(ans);

	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-7 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
