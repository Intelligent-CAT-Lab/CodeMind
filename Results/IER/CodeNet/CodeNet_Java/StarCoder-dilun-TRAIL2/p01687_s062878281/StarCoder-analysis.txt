variable str is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input.
Inside the for loop, it initializes 6 variables A, I, D, U, N and Y with 0.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 7.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current index i + j is within the range of the input.
If it is, it increments the corresponding variable by 1.
Then it checks if the variables A, I, D, U, N and Y are equal to 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1 respectively.
If it is, it replaces the character at index i with 'A', the character at index i + 1 with 'I', the character at index i + 2 with 'Z', the character at index i + 3 with 'U', the character at index i + 4 with 'N', the character at index i + 5 with 'Y', the character at index i + 6 with 'A' and the character at index i + 7 with 'N'.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable str as output, which is AZUNAN.
