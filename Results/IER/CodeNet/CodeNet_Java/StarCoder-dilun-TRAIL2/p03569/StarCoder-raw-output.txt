he variable s is initialized with the input string "xabxa". The variable length is initialized with the length of the string s.
The variable cnt is initialized with 0. The variable l is initialized with 0. The variable r is initialized with the length of the string s minus 1.
It enters a while loop and it keeps iterating until l is less than or equal to r.
Inside the while loop, it extracts the characters cl and cr from the string s at the positions l and r respectively.
Then it checks if the characters cl and cr are equal. If they are, it increments l and decrements r.
If they are not equal, it checks if cl is equal to 'x'. If it is, it increments cnt and increments l.
If cl is not equal to 'x', it checks if cr is equal to 'x'. If it is, it increments cnt and decrements r.
If cr is not equal to 'x', it sets cnt to -1 and breaks out of the while loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 2.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public void main(Scanner sc) {
        String s = sc.next();
        int length = s.length();

        int cnt = 0;
        int l = 0;
        int r = length - 1;
        while (l <= r) {
            char cl = s.charAt(l);
            char cr = s.charAt(r);

            if (cl == cr) {
                l++;
                r--;
            } else {
                if (cl == 'x') {
                    cnt++;
                    l++;
                } else if (cr == 'x') {
                    cnt++;
                    r--;
                } else {
                    cnt = -1;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(cnt);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        new Main().main(sc);
        sc.close();
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```xabxa
```
