he variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable c is initialized with the value of a*b*1.0/(a+b).
The value of variable c is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner d = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = d.nextInt();
		int b = d.nextInt();
		int c;
		c=a+b;
		System.out.println(c);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
