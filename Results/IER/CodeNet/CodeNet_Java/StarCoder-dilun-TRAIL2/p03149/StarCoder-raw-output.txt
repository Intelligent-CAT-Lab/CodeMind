he variable N is initialized with 4 integers, which are 1, 7, 9 and 4 respectively according to the input.
Then it sorts the array N in ascending order.
Then it checks if the first element of the sorted array N is 1, the second element is 4, the third element is 7 and the fourth element is 9.
If all the conditions are met, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int arr[] = new int[N];
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			sum += arr[i];
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5, which is the first input.
Then it initializes an array arr with 5 elements.
Then it calculates the sum of all the elements in the array arr and stores it in variable sum.
Finally, it prints the value of variable sum as output.
<<<Output>>>
15
