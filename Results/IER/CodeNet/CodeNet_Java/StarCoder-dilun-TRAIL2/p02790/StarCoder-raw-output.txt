he variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to a-1 to print the value of b.
If it is not, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to b-1 to print the value of a.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        if (a >= b)
            for (int i = 0; i < a; i++)
                System.out.print(b);
        else
            for (int i = 0; i < b; i++)
                System.out.print(a);

    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to a-1 to print the value of b.
If it is not, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to b-1 to print the value of a.
