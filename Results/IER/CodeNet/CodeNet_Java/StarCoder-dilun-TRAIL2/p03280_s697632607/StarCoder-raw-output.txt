he variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The code calculates the value of a*b - b - a + 1 and prints it as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int b = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        System.out.println(a*b - b - a + 1);
    }  
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
