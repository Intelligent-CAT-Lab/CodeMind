variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the minimum of n and m to calculate the product of all the integers in this range.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to the maximum of n and m to calculate the square of the product of all the integers in this range.
The final value of variable ans is the product of the two values calculated in the two loops.
