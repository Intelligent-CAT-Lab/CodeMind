variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the minimum of n and m to calculate the product of all the integers in this range.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to the maximum of n and m to calculate the square of the product of all the integers in this range.
The final value of variable ans is the product of the two values calculated in the two loops.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class Main {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
                try {
                        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
                        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
                        int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
                        int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
                        int k = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
                        int l = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
                        int answer = 0;

                        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                                for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                                        if (i + j >= k && i + j <= l) {
                                                answer++;
                                        }
                                }
                        }
                        System.out.println(answer);
                } catch (Exception e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                }
        }

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3 1 2```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable m, variable k and variable l are initialized with 3, 3, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to
