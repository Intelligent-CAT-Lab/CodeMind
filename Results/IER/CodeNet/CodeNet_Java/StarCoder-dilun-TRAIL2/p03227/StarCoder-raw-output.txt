he variable a is initialized with the input string "abc".
The variable b is initialized with the splitted string of variable a.
The variable c is initialized with the length of variable a.
The if statement checks if the length of variable a is equal to 3. If it is, it swaps the first and the third characters of variable b.
The for loop prints the characters of variable b.
<<<Output>>>
cab

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		
		if(a>b){
			if(a>c){
				System.out.println(a);
			}
			else{
				System.out.println(c);
			}
		}
		else{
			if(b>c){
				System.out.println(b);
			}
			else{
				System.out.println(c);
			}
		}
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with the first input integer.
The variable b is initialized with the second input integer.
The variable c is initialized with the third input integer.
The if statement checks if variable a is greater than variable b. If it is, it checks if variable a is greater than variable c. If it is, it prints the value of variable a. If it is not, it prints the value of variable c.
If variable a is not greater than variable b, it checks if variable b is greater than variable c. If it is, it prints the value of variable b. If it is not, it prints the value of variable c.
<<<Output>>>
3
