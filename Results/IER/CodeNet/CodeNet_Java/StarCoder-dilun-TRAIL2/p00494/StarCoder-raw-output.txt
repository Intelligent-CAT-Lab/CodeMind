ariable str is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the string str.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'O' and the previous character is not 'O'. If it is, it assigns the current index to variable s.
Then it checks if the current character is 'O' and the next character is not 'O'. If it is, it calculates the length of the substring from s to i.
If the length of the substring is greater than or equal to the length of the substring from i to the end of the string, it checks if the substring from s-1 to s-l+1 is 'J' and the substring from i+1 to i+l is 'I'.
If both conditions are met, it assigns the length of the substring to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int ans = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
			for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
				if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
					int temp = arr[i];
					arr[i] = arr[j];
					arr[j] = temp;
				}
			}
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
			if (arr[i] > 0) {
				ans += arr[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}
