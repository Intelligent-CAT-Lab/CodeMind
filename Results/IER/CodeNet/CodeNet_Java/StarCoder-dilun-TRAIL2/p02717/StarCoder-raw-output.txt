he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It prints the value of variables c, a and b in that order as output.
<<<Output>>>
3 1 2
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(a+b+c);
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 1, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It adds the values of variables a, b and c and prints the result as output.
<<<Output>>>
