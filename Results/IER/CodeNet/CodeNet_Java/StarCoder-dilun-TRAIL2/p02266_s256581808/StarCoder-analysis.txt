e variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is '\\'. If it is, it pushes the current index i to the stack stack1.
If the current character is '/' and the stack stack1 is not empty, it pops the top element of stack1 and assigns it to variable j.
Then it calculates the area of the rectangle with base i and height j - i.
It adds the area to variable sum.
Then it enters a while loop and it iterates while the stack stack2 is not empty and the top element of stack2 is greater than j.
Inside the while loop, it pops the top element of stack2 and assigns it to variable a.
It adds the area of the rectangle with base a[0] and height a[1] to variable area.
It adds the area to variable sum.
It pushes the current index i and the area to stack2.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the size of the list ans.
Inside the for loop, it pops the top element of stack2 and assigns it to variable a.
It adds the area of the rectangle with base a[0] and height a[1] to variable area.
It adds the area to variable sum.
It pushes the current index i and the area to stack2.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable sum as output.
It prints the size of the list ans as output.
It prints the elements of the list ans as output.
