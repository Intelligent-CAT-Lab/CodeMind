he variable x is initialized with 725 according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable x is in the range [400, 600). If it is, it sets the value of variable k to 8.
It checks if the value of variable x is in the range [600, 800). If it is, it sets the value of variable k to 7.
It checks if the value of variable x is in the range [800, 1000). If it is, it sets the value of variable k to 6.
It checks if the value of variable x is in the range [1000, 1200). If it is, it sets the value of variable k to 5.
It checks if the value of variable x is in the range [1200, 1400). If it is, it sets the value of variable k to 4.
It checks if the value of variable x is in the range [1400, 1600). If it is, it sets the value of variable k to 3.
It checks if the value of variable x is in the range [1600, 1800). If it is, it sets the value of variable k to 2.
It checks if the value of variable x is in the range [1800, 1999]. If it is, it sets the value of variable k to 1.
After the checks, it prints the value of variable k as output, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    int x = sc.nextInt();
    int k = 0;
    if(x % 2 == 0) k = 1;
    else k = 0;
    System.out.println(k);
  }
}
</Code>
