he variable n is initialized with the length of the input string.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the pointer ptr reaches the end of the input string.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current character is '>'. If it is, it enters another while loop to check if the current character is '>'.
If it is, it increments the pointer ptr and increments the counter cnt.
If the current character is not '>', it increments the counter curr.
After the while loop finishes, it checks if the last character of the input string is '<'. If it is, it increments the counter curr.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
