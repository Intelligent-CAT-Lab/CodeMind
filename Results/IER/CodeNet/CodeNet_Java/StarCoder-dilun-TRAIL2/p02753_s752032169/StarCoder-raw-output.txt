he variable S is initialized with the input string "ABA".
The variable word is initialized with the string array of the input string "ABA".
The variable result is initialized with an empty string.
It checks if the first three characters of the string array word are equal to "A" and if they are, it sets the variable result to "No".
It checks if the second three characters of the string array word are equal to "B" and if they are, it sets the variable result to "No".
It checks if the third three characters of the string array word are equal to "A" and if they are, it sets the variable result to "No".
After the checks, it prints the final value of variable result as output, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Your code here!
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        String S =sc.next();
        String word[] =S.split("");
        
        String result ="";
        
        
            if(word[0].equals("A") &&word[1].equals("A")&&word[2].equals("A")){
                result ="No";
            }else if(word[0].equals("B") &&word[1].equals("B")&&word[2].equals("B")){
                result ="No";
            }else{
                result ="Yes";
            }
            
        
        System.out.println(result);
        
    }
    
    
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ABA
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
