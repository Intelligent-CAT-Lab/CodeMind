he variable x and variable y are initialized with 11009 and 11332 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from x to y to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main{

     public static void main(String []args){
        //System.out.println("Hello World");
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scan.nextInt();
        int y = scan.nextInt();
        int count2 = 0 ;
        for(int i = x ; i<=y ;i++){
            int k = 1 ;
            int count = 0 ;
            char[] arr = String.valueOf(i).toCharArray();
            for(int j= 0 ; j<=arr.length/2 ; j++){
                
                if(arr[j] == arr[arr.length-k]){
                    count++ ; 
                }
                k++;
            }
            if(count == Math.ceil(arr.length/2.0)){
                count2++ ;
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(count2);
     }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11009 11332
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and variable y are initialized with 11009 and 11332 respectively according
