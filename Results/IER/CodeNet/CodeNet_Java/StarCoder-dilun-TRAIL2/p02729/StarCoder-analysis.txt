he variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the number of combinations of n and m by using the formula n * (n-1) / 2.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of m and n by using the formula m * (m-1) / 2.
Finally, it prints the sum of the two calculated values as output, which is 3.
