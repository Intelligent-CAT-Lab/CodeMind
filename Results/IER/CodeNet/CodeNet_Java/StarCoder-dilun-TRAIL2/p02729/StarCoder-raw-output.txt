he variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the number of combinations of n and m by using the formula n * (n-1) / 2.
Then it calculates the number of combinations of m and n by using the formula m * (m-1) / 2.
Finally, it prints the sum of the two calculated values as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		try(Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
			

			int n = sc.nextInt();
			int m = sc.nextInt();

			int nComb = n * (n-1) / 2;
			int mComb = m * (m-1) / 2;
			
			System.out.println(nComb - mComb);
			
		}
	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
