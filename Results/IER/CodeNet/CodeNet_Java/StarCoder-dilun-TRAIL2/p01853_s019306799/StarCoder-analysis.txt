ariable n is initialized with 3 and variable m is initialized with 100.
The code first checks if n is odd or even. If n is odd, it calculates the value of variable fst as n/2 + 1 and variable snd as n/2.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to fst - 1 to print 0.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to snd - 1 to print m.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
