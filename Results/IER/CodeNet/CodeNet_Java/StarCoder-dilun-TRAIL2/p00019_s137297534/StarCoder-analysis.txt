e variable nNum is initialized with -1.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until it reads a non-empty line from the input.
Inside the while loop, it reads a line from the input and parses it to an integer.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to nNum to calculate the factorial of n.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable nFact as output, which is 120.
