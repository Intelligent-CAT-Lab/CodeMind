e variable nNum is initialized with -1.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until it reads a non-empty line from the input.
Inside the while loop, it reads a line from the input and parses it to an integer.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to nNum to calculate the factorial of n.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable nFact as output, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
	private	static	BufferedReader	br = null;

	static {
		br   = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
	}

	/**
	 * @param args
	 */
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		int		nNum  = parseNum();
		long	nFact = 1;
		for (int n = 2; n <= nNum; n++ ) {
			nFact *= (long)n;
		}
		System.out.println(nFact);
	}

	private static int parseNum() {
		int	nNum = -1;
		try {
			String line = br.readLine();
			if (line!= null) {
				if (!line.isEmpty()) {
					nNum = Integer.parseInt(line);
				}
			}
		}
		catch (IOException e) {}

		return nNum;
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
