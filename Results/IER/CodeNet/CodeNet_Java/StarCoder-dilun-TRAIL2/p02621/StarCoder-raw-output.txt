he variable a is initialized with 2 according to the input.
The value of variable a is passed to the function main() as parameter.
Inside the function main(), it calculates the value of variable a + (a*a) + (a*a*a) and prints it as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
    {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int a  = sc.nextInt();
      System.out.println(a + (a*a) + (a*a*a));
    }
      
}    

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
