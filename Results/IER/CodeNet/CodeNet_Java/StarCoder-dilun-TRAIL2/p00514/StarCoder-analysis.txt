he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 0 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if the product of a and b is greater than c. If it is, it prints 0 and exits the program.
If the if statement is not met, it subtracts the product of a and b from c.
Then it calculates the value of variable d by adding the value of variable c and the value of variable a minus 1.
Then it calculates the value of variable bi by multiplying the value of variable bi by the value of variable d minus i.
Then it divides the value of variable bi by the value of variable i plus 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable bi as output, which is 1.
