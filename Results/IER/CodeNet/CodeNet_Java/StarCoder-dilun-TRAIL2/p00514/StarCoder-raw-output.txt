he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 0 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if the product of a and b is greater than c. If it is, it prints 0 and exits the program.
If the if statement is not met, it subtracts the product of a and b from c.
Then it calculates the value of variable d by adding the value of variable c and the value of variable a minus 1.
Then it calculates the value of variable bi by multiplying the value of variable bi by the value of variable d minus i.
Then it divides the value of variable bi by the value of variable i plus 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable bi as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.math.*;
class Main{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
		int a=s.nextInt();
		int b=s.nextInt();
		int c=s.nextInt();
		if(a*b>c){
			System.out.println(0);
			System.exit(0);
		}
		c-=a*b;
		int d=c+a-1;
		BigInteger bi=new BigInteger("1");
		for(int i=0;i<c;i++){
			bi=bi.multiply(new BigInteger(""+(d-i)));
			bi=bi.divide(new BigInteger(""+(i+1)));
		}
		System.out.println(bi.toString());
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 0 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 0 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if the product of a and b is greater than c. If it is, it prints
