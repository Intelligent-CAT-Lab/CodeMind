he variable N and variable K are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans by repeatedlly dividing the current interger ans by (K-1) and adding 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
