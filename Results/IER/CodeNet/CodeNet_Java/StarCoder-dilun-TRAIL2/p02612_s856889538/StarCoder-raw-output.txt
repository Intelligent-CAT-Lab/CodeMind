he variable n is initialized with 1900.
The variable x is initialized with the last three digits of n.
The variable answer is initialized with 0.
It checks if x is greater than 0. If it is, it subtracts x from 1000 and stores the result in variable answer.
If x is not greater than 0, it stores 0 in variable answer.
After the if statement, it prints the value of variable answer as output, which is 900.
<<<Output>>>
900

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String line = sc.nextLine();
      	int n = Integer.parseInt(line);
      
      	int x = n % 1000;
      	int answer = 0;
      	if(x > 0){
          answer = 1000 - x;
        }
      System.out.println(String.valueOf(answer));
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1900
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
