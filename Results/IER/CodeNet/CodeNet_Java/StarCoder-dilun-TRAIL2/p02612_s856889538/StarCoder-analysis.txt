he variable n is initialized with 1900.
The variable x is initialized with the last three digits of n.
The variable answer is initialized with 0.
It checks if x is greater than 0. If it is, it subtracts x from 1000 and stores the result in variable answer.
If x is not greater than 0, it stores 0 in variable answer.
After the if statement, it prints the value of variable answer as output, which is 900.
