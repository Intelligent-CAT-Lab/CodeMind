NO-ANSWER
he variable S is initialized with the string "acca".
The variable N is initialized with the length of the string S.
The variable next is initialized with an array of length N with all values -1.
The variable prev is initialized with an array of length N with all values -1.
The variable start is initialized with an array of length 26 with all values -1.
The variable end is initialized with an array of length 26 with all values -1.
The for loop iterates from 0 to N-1 to check each character ch in the string S.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable end at index ch is -1. If it is, it sets the value of variable start at index ch to the current index i.
Otherwise, it sets the value of variable next at index end at index ch to the current index i.
It also sets the value of variable prev at index i to the value of variable end at index ch.
It also sets the value of variable end at index ch to the current index i.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop to check each character ch in the string S.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable start at index ch is -1. If it is, it skips the current iteration.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable count by subtracting the value of variable start at index ch from the cumulative sum of the array v starting from index 1 to index start at index ch plus 1.
It also calculates the value of variable count by adding the value of variable N minus the value of variable end at index ch from the cumulative sum of the array v starting from index end at index ch plus 1 to index N.
It also checks if the value of variable count is less than the value of variable min. If it is, it sets the value of variable min to the value of variable count and it sets the value of variable mi to the value of variable ch.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable mi is -1. If it is, it prints -1 and returns.
Otherwise, it adds the value of variable min to the value of variable ans.
It also adds 1 to the value of variable v at index start at index mi plus 1.
It also adds 1 to the value of variable v at index end at index
