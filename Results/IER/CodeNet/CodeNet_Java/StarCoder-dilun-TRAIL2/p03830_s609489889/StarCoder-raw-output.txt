e variable N is initialized with 3.
The code calls the method getPrimes(1000) to get a list of primes less than or equal to 1000.
The code then initializes an array memo with 1000+1 elements.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it iterates while variable tmp is greater than 0 and the remainder of tmp divided by p is equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it divides variable tmp by p.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates through the list of primes.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current prime p is less than or equal to the current integer i. If it is, it increments the value of memo[p] by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to 1000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it iterates while variable tmp is greater than 0 and the remainder of tmp divided by p is equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it divides variable tmp by p.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates through the list of primes.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current prime p is less than or equal to the current integer i. If it is, it increments the value of dp[i][j + 1] by dp[i][j] and modulos it by MOD.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to 1000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it iterates while variable tmp is greater than 0 and the remainder of tmp divided by p is equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it divides variable tmp by p.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates through the list of
