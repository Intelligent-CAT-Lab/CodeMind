iable count is initialized with 26 elements.
The while loop is entered and it reads the input line by line.
The length of the input string is calculated and stored in variable sl.
The input string is converted to lower case and stored in variable s.
The char array of the input string is created and stored in variable charArray.
The for loop is entered and it iterates through the char array.
The current char is stored in variable ch.
The value of variable ch is calculated and stored in variable CH.
The if statement is entered and it checks if the value of variable CH falls within the range [0, 25].
If it does, it increments the value of the element of count at the index of variable CH by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25 to print the value of the element of count at the index of variable i.
