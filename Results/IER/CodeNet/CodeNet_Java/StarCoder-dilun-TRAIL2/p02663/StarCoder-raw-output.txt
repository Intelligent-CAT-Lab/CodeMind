he variable h1, variable m1, variable h2, variable m2 and variable k are initialized with 10, 0, 15, 0 and 30 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the difference between variable h2 and variable h1 and stores the result in variable h.
It calculates the difference between variable m2 and variable m1 and stores the result in variable m.
It calculates the sum of variable h and variable m and stores the result in variable day.
It subtracts variable k from variable day and stores the result in variable day.
After the calculations, it print the fianl value of variable day as output, which is 24.
<<<Output>>>
24
