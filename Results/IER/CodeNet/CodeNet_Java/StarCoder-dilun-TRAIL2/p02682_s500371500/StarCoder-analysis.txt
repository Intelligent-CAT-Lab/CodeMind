e variable a, b, c and k are initialized with 2, 1, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It calculates the minimum of a and k and adds it to variable ans.
Then it subtracts the minimum of b and k from variable k.
Then it subtracts the minimum of c and k from variable k.
If variable k is greater than 0, it subtracts the minimum of k and c from variable ans.
