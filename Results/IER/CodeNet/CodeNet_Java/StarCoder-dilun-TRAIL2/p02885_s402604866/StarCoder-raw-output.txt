he variable yoko is initialized with 12 and variable a is initialized with 4.
It checks if the value of yoko minus 2 times a is greater than 0. If it is, it adds the value of yoko minus 2 times a to variable sum.
It then print the final value of variable sum as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

        int yoko = Integer.parseInt(scan.next());
		int a = Integer.parseInt(scan.next());

		int sum = 0;

		if(yoko - 2*a> 0) {
			sum = yoko - 2*a;
		}

		scan.close();
		System.out.println(sum);

	}

}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
