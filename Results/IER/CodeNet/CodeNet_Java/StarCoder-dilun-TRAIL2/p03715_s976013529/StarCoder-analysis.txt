he variable h and variable w are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable h2.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger h2 by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable s1.
Then it checks if the calculated variable s1 falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 12.
