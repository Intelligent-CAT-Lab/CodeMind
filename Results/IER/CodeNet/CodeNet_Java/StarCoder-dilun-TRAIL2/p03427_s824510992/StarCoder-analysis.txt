e variable n is initialized with 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n.length-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger num is not equal to 9. If it is not, it sets the flag to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the flag is true. If it is, it sets the final value of variable ans to (n[0]-'1')+9*(n.length-1). Otherwise, it sets the final value of variable ans to (n[0]-'0')+9*(n.length-1).
After the if-else statement, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 100.
