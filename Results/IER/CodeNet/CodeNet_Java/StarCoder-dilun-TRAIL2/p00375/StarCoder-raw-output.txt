he variable a is initialized with 68 according to the input.
It calculates the difference between variable a and 30 and then divides it by 2.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main
{

    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();

        System.out.println(a * 2);
    }

}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```68
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 68 according to the input.
It multiplies variable a by 2.
<<<Output>>>
