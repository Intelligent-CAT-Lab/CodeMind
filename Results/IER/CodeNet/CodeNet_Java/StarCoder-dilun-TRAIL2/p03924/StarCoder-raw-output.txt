ariable N and variable M are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable k.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable k.
Inside the third for loop, it calculates the value of variable dp[i+1][j+1][k] by adding the value of variable dp[i][j][k] multiplied by (N-j) and the value of variable dp[i][j][k] multiplied by (j-k).
Then it calculates the value of variable dp[i+1][j][j] by adding the value of variable dp[i][j][k] multiplied by k.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp[M][N][N] as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
