he variable s is initialized with the input string "uncopyrightable".
The variable c is initialized with an array of the same length as the input string.
The variable c is filled with the characters of the input string.
The array c is sorted in ascending order.
The for loop iterates from 0 to the length of the input string minus 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character and the next character are the same. If they are, it prints "no" as output and returns.
If the for loop finishes without printing "no", it prints "yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    int[] arr = new int[n];
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
    }
    int max = arr[0];
    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      if(arr[i] > max) {
        max = arr[i];
      }
    }
    System.out.println(max);
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer 5.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of length n.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it reads the next integer from the input and assigns it to the ith element of the array arr.
The variable max is initialized with the first element of the array arr.
The for loop iterates from 1 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the ith element of the array arr is greater than the variable max. If it is, it assigns the ith element of the array arr to the variable max.
After the for
