he variable s is initialized with the input string "uncopyrightable".
The variable c is initialized with an array of the same length as the input string.
The variable c is filled with the characters of the input string.
The array c is sorted in ascending order.
The for loop iterates from 0 to the length of the input string minus 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character and the next character are the same. If they are, it prints "no" as output and returns.
If the for loop finishes without printing "no", it prints "yes" as output.
