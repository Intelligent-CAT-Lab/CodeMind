he variable CMD is initialized with null.
The variable BR is initialized with a new instance of BufferedReader.
The variable str is initialized with the input splitted by space.
The variable x is initialized with the first element of the array str converted to integer.
The variable y is initialized with the second element of the array str converted to integer.
The if statement checks if x is equal to y. If it is, it prints "a == b".
The if statement checks if x is less than y. If it is, it prints "a < b".
The if statement checks if x is greater than y. If it is, it prints "a > b".
<<<Output>>>
a < b

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		String CMD = null ;
		BufferedReader BR = null;
		BR = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		try {CMD = BR.readLine();
		} 
		catch (IOException e) {e.printStackTrace();
		}
		String[] str = CMD.split(" "); 
		
		int x = Integer.parseInt(str[0]);
		int y = Integer.parseInt(str[1]);
		
		if(x==y){
			System.out.println("a == b");
		}if(x<y){
			System.out.println("a < b");
		}if(x>y){
			System.out.println("a > b");
		}

	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
