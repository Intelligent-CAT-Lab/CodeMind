he variable a is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string a. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of the string a is equal to '1'. If it is, it increments the value of variable marbles.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable marbles as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int max = arr[0];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > max) {
                max = arr[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the current interger i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 5.
