he variable x and variable y are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is equal to any of the elements in array A. If it is, it sets the value of variable Xans to "A".
It also checks if the current interger i is equal to any of the elements in array B. If it is, it sets the value of variable Yans to "B".
It also checks if the current interger i is equal to 2. If it is, it sets the value of variable Xans to "C".
It also checks if the current interger i is equal to 2. If it is, it sets the value of variable Yans to "C".
After the loop finishes, it checks if the values of variables Xans and Yans are equal. If they are, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int x, y;
		int A[] = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12 };
		int B[] = { 4, 6, 9, 11 };
		String Xans, Yans;
		Xans = "";
		Yans = "";
		x = sc.nextInt();
		y = sc.nextInt();

		for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
			if (x == A[i])
				Xans = "A";
			if (y == A[i])
				Yans = "A";
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < B.length; i++) {
			if (x == B[i])
				Xans = "B";
