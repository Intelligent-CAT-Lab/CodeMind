he variable x is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the next value of the current interger i by adding 1 to it and multiplying it by 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable next as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x = sc.nextInt();
		long next = 2;
		for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
			next = (next + 1) * 2;
		}
		System.out.println(next);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the next value of the current interger i by adding 1 to it and multiplying it by 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable next as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
