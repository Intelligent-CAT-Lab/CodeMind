he variable N, variable K and variable X0 are initialized with the input values.
The variable DIV is initialized with 1L << 52.
The variable SHIFT is initialized with -(Long.MIN_VALUE / DIV).
The variable c is initialized with an array of size (int) (Long.MAX_VALUE / DIV + SHIFT + 1).
The variable x is initialized with the value of variable X0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to N-1 to calculate the values of the array c.
The while loop iterates until the value of variable K is less than or equal to 0.
The variable pos is initialized with 0.
The while loop iterates until the value of variable K is less than or equal to 0.
The variable list is initialized with an array of size c[pos].
The variable ai is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to N-1 to calculate the values of the array c.
The if statement checks if the current value of variable idx is equal to the value of variable pos. If it is, it adds the current value of variable x to the array list.
The variable ai is incremented by 1.
The x is updated with the value of x XOR x << 13.
The x is updated with the value of x XOR x >>> 7.
The x is updated with the value of x XOR x << 17.
The array list is sorted in ascending order.
The value of the K-th element of the array list is printed as output.
