he variable s is initialized with the input.
The variable n is initialized with the length of variable s.
The variable left is initialized with the substring of variable s from index 0 to ((n + 1) / 2) - 1.
The variable right is initialized with the substring of variable s from ((n + 3) / 2) - 1 to n.
The function function(s) is called with variable s as argument.
The function function(left) is called with variable left as argument.
The function function(right) is called with variable right as argument.
The function function(s) returns true if the length of variable s is even and the left substring of variable s is equal to the reverse of the right substring of variable s.
The function function(left) returns true if the length of variable left is even and the left substring of variable left is equal to the reverse of the right substring of variable left.
The function function(right) returns true if the length of variable right is even and the left substring of variable right is equal to the reverse of the right substring of variable right.
The function function(s) returns true if the length of variable s is even and the left substring of variable s is equal to the reverse of the right substring of variable s.
The function function(left) returns true if the length of variable left is even and the left substring of variable left is equal to the reverse of the right substring of variable left.
The function function(right) returns true if the length of variable right is even and the left substring of variable right is equal to the reverse of the right substring of variable right.
The function function(s) returns true if the length of variable s is even and the left substring of variable s is equal to the reverse of the right substring of variable s.
The function function(left) returns true if the length of variable left is even and the left substring of variable left is equal to the reverse of the right substring of variable left.
The function function(right) returns true if the length of variable right is even and the left substring of variable right is equal to the reverse of the right substring of variable right.
The function function(s) returns true if the length of variable s is even and the left substring of variable s is equal to the reverse of the right substring of variable s.
The function function(left) returns true if the length of variable left
