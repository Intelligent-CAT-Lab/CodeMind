he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2.
The if statement checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to 0.
Otherwise, it sets the value of variable ans to n - k.
After the if statement, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int ans = 0;
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		
		if(k == 1){
			ans = 0;
		}else{
			ans = n - k;
		}
		
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
