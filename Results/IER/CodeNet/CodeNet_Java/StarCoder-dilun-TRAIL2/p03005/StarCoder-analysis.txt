he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2.
The if statement checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to 0.
Otherwise, it sets the value of variable ans to n - k.
After the if statement, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
