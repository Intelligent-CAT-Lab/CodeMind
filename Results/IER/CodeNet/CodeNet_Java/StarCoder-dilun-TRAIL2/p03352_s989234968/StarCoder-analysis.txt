he variable x is initialized with 10.
The variable mx is initialized with 0.
It checks if x is less than 4. If it is, it sets the value of variable mx to 1.
If it is not, it calculates the square root of x and stores it in variable sq.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of x. The value of variable i is also passed to variable jo.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of jo by raising i to the power of the floor of the logarithm of x to the base i.
Then it checks if the calculated variable jo is greater than the current value of variable mx. If it is, it sets the value of variable mx to the calculated value of jo.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable mx as output, which is 10.
