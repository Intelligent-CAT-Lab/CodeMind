he variable res is initialized with an array of 26 elements.
It enters a while loop and it reads a line of input from the user.
Inside the while loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is in the range [65, 90] or [97, 122]. If it is, it increments the corresponding element of the array res by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it prints the character corresponding to the current index of the array res.
