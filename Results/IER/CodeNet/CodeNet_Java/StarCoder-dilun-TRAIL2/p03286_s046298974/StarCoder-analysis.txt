e variable N is initialized with -9.
The variable base is initialized with 2.
The variable sb is initialized with an empty string.
The while loop is entered and it checks if N is not equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the absolute value of N modulo base and appends the result to the beginning of the string sb.
Then it subtracts the absolute value of N modulo base from N.
The while loop is repeated until N is equal to 0.
If the string sb is empty, it appends the string "0" to the beginning of the string sb.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the final value of the string sb as output, which is 1011.
