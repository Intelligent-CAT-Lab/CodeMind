e variable N is initialized with -9.
The variable base is initialized with 2.
The variable sb is initialized with an empty string.
The while loop is entered and it checks if N is not equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the absolute value of N modulo base and appends the result to the beginning of the string sb.
Then it subtracts the absolute value of N modulo base from N.
The while loop is repeated until N is equal to 0.
If the string sb is empty, it appends the string "0" to the beginning of the string sb.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the final value of the string sb as output, which is 1011.
<<<Output>>>
1011

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
public class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) throws IOException {
        final String s;
        try (BufferedReader reader =
                 new BufferedReader (new InputStreamReader (System.in))) {
            s = reader.readLine();
        }
        int           N    = Integer.parseInt (s);
        StringBuilder sb   = new StringBuilder();
        int           base = 2;
        while (0!= N) {
            sb.insert (0, String.valueOf (Math.abs (N % base)));
            N -= Math.abs (N % base);
            N /= -base;
        }
        if (sb.length() == 0) sb.append ("0");
        System.out.println (sb);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-9
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
