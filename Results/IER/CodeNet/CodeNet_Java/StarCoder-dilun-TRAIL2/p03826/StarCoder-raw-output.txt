he variable a is initialized with 3*5=15 and variable b is initialized with 2*7=14.
The value of variable a is compared with the value of variable b. If a is less than b, then the value of b is printed as output. Otherwise, the value of a is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
14

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int a=sc.nextInt(),b=sc.nextInt(),c=sc.nextInt(),d=sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println((a<b)?((a<c)?((a<d)?a:d):((c<d)?c:d)):((b<c)?((b<d)?b:d):((c<d)?c:d)));
		sc.close();
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 2 7
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 3, variable b is initialized with 5, variable c is initialized with 2 and variable d is initialized with 7.
The value of variable a is compared with the value of variable b. If a is less than b, then the value of a is compared with the value of variable c. If a is less than c, then the value of a is compared with the value of variable d. If a is less than d, then the value of a is printed as output. Otherwise, the value of d is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
