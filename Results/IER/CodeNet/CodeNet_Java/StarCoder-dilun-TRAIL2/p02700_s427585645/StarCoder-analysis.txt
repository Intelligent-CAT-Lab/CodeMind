variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 10, 9, 10 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the number of times that c can be divided by b by repeatedlly dividing c by b and adding 1 to the result until c is not divisible by b.
It calculates the number of times that a can be divided by d by repeatedlly dividing a by d and adding 1 to the result until a is not divisible by d.
Then it checks if the calculated number of times that c can be divided by b is less than or equal to the calculated number of times that a can be divided by d. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
