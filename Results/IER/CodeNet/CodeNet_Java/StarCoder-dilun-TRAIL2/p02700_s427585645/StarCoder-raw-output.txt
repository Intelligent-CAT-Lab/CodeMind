variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 10, 9, 10 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the number of times that c can be divided by b by repeatedlly dividing c by b and adding 1 to the result until c is not divisible by b.
It calculates the number of times that a can be divided by d by repeatedlly dividing a by d and adding 1 to the result until a is not divisible by d.
Then it checks if the calculated number of times that c can be divided by b is less than or equal to the calculated number of times that a can be divided by d. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int d = sc.nextInt();
        int cntT = c / b;
        if(c % b!= 0) cntT++;
        int cntA = a / d;
        if(a % d!= 0) cntA++;
        System.out.println( cntT <= cntA? "Yes" : "No");
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 9 10 10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
