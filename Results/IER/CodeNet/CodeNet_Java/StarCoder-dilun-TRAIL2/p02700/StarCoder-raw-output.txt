he variable insn is initialized with the input array [10, 9, 10, 10].
The variable a is initialized with 10, variable b is initialized with 9, variable c is initialized with 10, variable d is initialized with 10.
The variable t is initialized with 1, variable tt is initialized with 1, variable y is initialized with 1, variable u is initialized with 0.
The while loop is entered and it checks if the variables a, c, b, d are all positive.
Inside the while loop, it subtracts b from c and stores the result in variable c.
Then it checks if c is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Yes" and returns.
Then it subtracts d from a and stores the result in variable a.
Then it checks if a is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints "No" and returns.
After the while loop finishes, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No
