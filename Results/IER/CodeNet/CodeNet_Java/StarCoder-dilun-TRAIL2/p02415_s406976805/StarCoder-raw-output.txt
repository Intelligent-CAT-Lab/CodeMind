he variable str is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string str. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character c is an uppercase character. If it is, it converts it to lowercase. If it is not, it converts it to uppercase.
After the loop finishes, it print the final string as output, which is fair, later, occasionally cloudy.
<<<Output>>>
fair, later, occasionally cloudy.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String str = sc.nextLine();
        for(int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++){
            char c = str.charAt(i);
            if(Character.isUpperCase(c)){
                c = Character.toLowerCase(c);
            }
            else{
                c = Character.toUpperCase(c);
            }
            System.out.print(c);
        }
        System.out.println("");
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
