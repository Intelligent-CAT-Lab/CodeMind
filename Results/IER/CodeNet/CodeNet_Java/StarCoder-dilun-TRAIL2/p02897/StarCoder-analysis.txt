he variable n is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is even or odd. If it is even, it adds 1 to variable notOdd. If it is odd, it adds 1 to variable odd.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable odd divided by variable n as output, which is 0.25.
