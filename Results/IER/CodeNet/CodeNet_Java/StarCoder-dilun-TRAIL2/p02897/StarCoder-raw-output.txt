he variable n is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is even or odd. If it is even, it adds 1 to variable notOdd. If it is odd, it adds 1 to variable odd.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable odd divided by variable n as output, which is 0.25.
<<<Output>>>
0.25

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    int n = sc.nextInt();

    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      sum += i;
    }
    System.out.println(sum);
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
