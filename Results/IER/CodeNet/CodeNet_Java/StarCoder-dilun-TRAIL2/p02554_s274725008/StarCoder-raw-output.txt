he variable N is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable result by multiplying it with 10 and then taking the modulo of it with 1000000007.
It also calculates the value of variable src by multiplying it with 9 and then taking the modulo of it with 1000000007.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of variable result by subtracting the value of variable src from the value of variable result and then taking the modulo of it with 1000000007.
It also calculates the value of variable result2 by multiplying it with 10 and then taking the modulo of it with 1000000007.
It also calculates the value of variable src2 by multiplying it with 8 and then taking the modulo of it with 1000000007.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of variable result2 by subtracting the value of variable src2 from the value of variable result2 and then taking the modulo of it with 1000000007.
It also calculates the value of variable result by subtracting the value of variable result2 from the value of variable result and then taking the modulo of it with 1000000007.
It checks if the value of variable result is less than 0. If it is, it adds the value of variable mod to the value of variable result and then prints it.
If it is not, it prints the value of variable result.
