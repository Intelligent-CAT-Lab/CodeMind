 variable n and variable k are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable pownk1 is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable pownk1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable pownk1 by repeatedlly multiplying it with (k+1) and then taking the modulo of it with MOD.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable total.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable total by repeatedlly adding it with i * pownk1 and then taking the modulo of it with MOD.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable total.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable total by repeatedlly adding it with i * pownk1 and then taking the modulo of it with MOD.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 1 to check each integer head in this range. The value of variable head is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100000 to check each integer ha in this range. The value of variable ha is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable base by repeatedlly taking the value of variable dp[head][ha] and then taking the modulo of it with MOD.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer l in this range. The value of variable l is also passed to variable canha.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable canha by dividing (ha + l) with head.
Then it calculates the value of variable dp[head-1][ha+canha] by repeatedlly adding it with base and then taking the modulo of it with MOD.
Then it calculates the value of variable dp[head-1][ha] by repeatedlly adding it with base and then taking the modulo of it with MOD.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable dec.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable dec by repeatedlly multiplying it with dp[0][i] and then taking the modulo of it with MOD.
Then it calculates the value of variable total by repeatedlly adding it with MOD-dec and then taking the modulo of it with MOD.
Then it prints the final value of variable total as output, which is 1000000000.
<<<Output>>>
1000000000
