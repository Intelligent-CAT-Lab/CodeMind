he variable d is initialized with 20 and variable c is initialized with 2.
The code reads two integers from the input and stores them in variables d and c respectively.
The code then prints the product of d and c as output, which is 40.
<<<Output>>>
40

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(d/c);

    }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable d is initialized with 20 and variable c is initialized with 2.
The code reads two integers from the input and stores them in variables d and c respectively.
The code then prints the quotient of d and c as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
