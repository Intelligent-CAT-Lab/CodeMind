he variable X is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from X to 0 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
                try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
                        int X = sc.nextInt();
                        long ans = 2;
                        for (int i = X; i > 0; i--) {
                                ans = ans * 2 + 2;
                        }
                        System.out.println(ans);
                }
        }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
