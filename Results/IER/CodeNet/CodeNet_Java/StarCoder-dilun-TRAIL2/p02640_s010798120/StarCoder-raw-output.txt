he variable x is initialized with 3 and variable y is initialized with 8.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the current interger i by adding 2 times i and 4 times (x-i).
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to variable y. If it is, it sets the value of variable flg to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable flg is true. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x = sc.nextInt();
		int y = sc.nextInt();
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i <= x; i++) {
			sum += i;
		}
		if (sum == y) {
			System.out.println("Yes");
		} else {
			System.out.println("No");
		}
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 3 and variable y is initialized with 6.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to variable y. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
