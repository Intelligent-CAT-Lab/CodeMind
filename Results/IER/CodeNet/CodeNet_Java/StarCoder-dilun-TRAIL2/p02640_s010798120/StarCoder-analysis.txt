he variable x is initialized with 3 and variable y is initialized with 8.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the current interger i by adding 2 times i and 4 times (x-i).
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to variable y. If it is, it sets the value of variable flg to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable flg is true. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
