e variable n, variable m and variable d are initialized with 2, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable s is initialized with the value of d. If d is 0, then s is initialized with the value of n. Otherwise, s is initialized with the value of ((n - d) * 2).
The final value of s is divided by n and n to get the final value of s.
The final value of s is multiplied by (m-1) to get the final value of s.
The final value of s is divided by m to get the final value of s.
The final value of s is multiplied by 1.0 to get the final value of s.
The final value of s is printed as output.
