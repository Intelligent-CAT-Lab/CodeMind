e variable n, variable m and variable d are initialized with 2, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable s is initialized with the value of d. If d is 0, then s is initialized with the value of n. Otherwise, s is initialized with the value of ((n - d) * 2).
The final value of s is divided by n and n to get the final value of s.
The final value of s is multiplied by (m-1) to get the final value of s.
The final value of s is divided by m to get the final value of s.
The final value of s is multiplied by 1.0 to get the final value of s.
The final value of s is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    private static final PrintStream so = System.out;
    private static final Scanner     sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long n = sc.nextLong();
        long m = sc.nextLong();
        long d = sc.nextLong();
        
        long s = d == 0? n : ((n - d) * 2);
        so.println((double) s/n/n*(m-1));
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable m and variable d are initialized with 2, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable s is initialized with the value of d. If d is 0, then s is initialized with the value of n. Otherwise, s is initialized with the value of ((n - d) * 2).
The final value of s is divided by n and n to get the final value of s.
The final value of s is multiplied by (m-1)
