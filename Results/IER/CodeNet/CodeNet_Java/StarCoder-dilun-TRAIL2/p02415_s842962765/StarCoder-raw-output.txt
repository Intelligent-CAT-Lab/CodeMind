he variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character c is within the range of [a, z] or [A, Z]. If it is, it subtracts the value of 'a' from the value of 'A' and vice versa.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable s as output, which is Fair, Later, Occasionally Cloudy.
<<<Output>>>
Fair, Later, Occasionally Cloudy.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args ) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if('a' <= c && c <= 'z')
                c -= 'a' - 'A';
            else if('A' <= c && c <= 'Z')
                c += 'a' - 'A';
            System.out.print(c);
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
