he variable A and variable B are initialized with 12 and 18 respectively according to the input.
The variable count is initialized with 1.
It calculates the greatest common divisor of A and B by calling the gcd function.
Then it divides the greatest common divisor by each prime number less than or equal to the square root of the greatest common divisor.
If the remainder of the division is 0, it means that the number is a prime number.
If the number is not a prime number, it divides the number by the prime number and repeats the process until the number is a prime number.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 4.
