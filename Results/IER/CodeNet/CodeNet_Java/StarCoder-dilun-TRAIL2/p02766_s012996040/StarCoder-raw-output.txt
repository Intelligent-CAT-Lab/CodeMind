he variable n is initialized with 11 and variable k is initialized with 2.
The code first converts the integer n to a string with base k. Then it prints the length of the string.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(Integer.toString(n, k).length());
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
