he variable str is initialized with an empty string.
The variable cnt is initialized with an array of length 26.
It enters a while loop and it reads the input line by line.
Inside the while loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string to check each character j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string low_az to check each character i in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current character j is equal to the character i of the string low_az or the string up_az. If it is, it increments the value of cnt[i] by 1.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string low_az to check each character i in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it prints the character i of the string low_az and the value of cnt[i] as output.
