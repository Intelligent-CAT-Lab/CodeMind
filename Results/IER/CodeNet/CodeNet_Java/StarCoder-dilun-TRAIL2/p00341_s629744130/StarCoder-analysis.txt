he variable e is initialized with 12.
The variable t is initialized with an array of 12 elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of t[j] is less than the value of t[j+1]. If it is, it swaps the values of t[j] and t[j+1].
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11 to check each integer x in this range. The value of variable x is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of t[j] is equal to the value of t[j+1] and so on.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the values of t[0], t[1], t[2], t[3], t[4], t[5], t[6], t[7], t[8], t[9] and t[10] are equal. If they are, it prints "yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "no" as output.
