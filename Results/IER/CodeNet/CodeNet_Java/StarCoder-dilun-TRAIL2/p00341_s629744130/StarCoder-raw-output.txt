he variable e is initialized with 12.
The variable t is initialized with an array of 12 elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of t[j] is less than the value of t[j+1]. If it is, it swaps the values of t[j] and t[j+1].
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11 to check each integer x in this range. The value of variable x is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of t[j] is equal to the value of t[j+1] and so on.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the values of t[0], t[1], t[2], t[3], t[4], t[5], t[6], t[7], t[8], t[9] and t[10] are equal. If they are, it prints "yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "no" as output.
<<<Output>>>
yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int a[] = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            a[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int max = a[0];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (a[i] > max) {
                max = a[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the
