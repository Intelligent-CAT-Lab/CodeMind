he code first reads the input and stores it in an array of integers. Then it calls the quickSort function to sort the array.
The quickSort function first divides the array into two parts, left and right. Then it compares the value of the middle element of the array with the value of the pivot.
If the value of the middle element is less than the pivot, then the left part of the array is searched for the value of the pivot.
If the value of the middle element is greater than the pivot, then the right part of the array is searched for the value of the pivot.
If the value of the middle element is equal to the pivot, then the middle element is swapped with the leftmost element of the right part of the array.
Then the quickSort function is called recursively on the left and right parts of the array.
The arrayPrintln function prints the array in reverse order.
The main function first initializes an array of integers with 5 elements. Then it initializes a Scanner object to read the input.
The main function enters a while loop and it reads the input 5 times.
Inside the while loop, it reads the input 5 times and stores it in the array inp.
Then it calls the quickSort function to sort the array inp.
Then it calls the arrayPrintln function to print the sorted array.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

class Main{

	public static void quickSort(int[] arr, int left, int right){
		if (left <= right) {
		int p = arr[(left+right) / 2];
		int l = left;
		int r = right;
		
		while(l <= r) {
			while(arr[l] < p){ l++; }
			while(arr[r] > p){ r--; }

			if (l <= r) {
				int tmp = arr[l];
				arr[l] = arr[r];
				arr[r] = tmp;
				l++; 
				r--;
			}
		}
		quickSort(arr, left, r);
		quickSort(arr, l, right);
		}
