he variable an, variable ad, variable bn, variable bd are initialized with 0, 1, 0, 1 respectively.
The input is split into two parts by the character '(' and ')'. The first part is the non-recurring part and the second part is the recurring part.
If the second part is not empty, it means that the recurring part exists.
The non-recurring part is split into two parts by the character '.'. The first part is the integer part and the second part is the decimal part.
If the second part is not empty, it means that the decimal part exists.
The integer part is converted to an integer and assigned to variable an.
The decimal part is converted to an integer and assigned to variable ad.
If the second part is empty, it means that the decimal part does not exist.
The recurring part is converted to an integer and assigned to variable bn.
The length of the recurring part is assigned to variable bd.
The final value of variable an is calculated by multiplying the integer part by the value of variable ad and adding the decimal part to the result.
The final value of variable bn is calculated by multiplying the integer part by the value of variable bd.
The final value of variable ad is calculated by multiplying the value of variable ad by the value of variable bd.
The final value of variable bd is calculated by calculating the least common multiple of the values of variable ad and variable bd.
The final value of variable n is calculated by dividing the value of variable n by the value of variable g.
The final value of variable d is calculated by dividing the value of variable d by the value of variable g.
The final value of variable n is printed as the output.
