 variable l is initialized with 5 and variable k is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to l-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	static final int MAX_L = 100;
	void run() {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int l = scan.nextInt();
		int k = scan.nextInt();
		long[] dp = new long[MAX_L + 1];
		dp[0] = dp[1] = 1;
		for (int i = 2; i < l; i++) {
			long num = i - k - 1 < 0? 0 : dp[i-k-1];
			dp[i] = dp[i - 2] + num + 1;
		}
		dp[l] = dp[l - 1] + (l >= k? dp[l - k]:0);
		System.out.println(dp[l]);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Main().run();
	}
}
