e variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 10, 10 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 120 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable when.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable roop by dividing the current interger i by the sum of variable a and variable b.
Then it checks if the calculated variable roop falls within the range [0, 119]. If it does, it checks if the calculated variable when falls within the range [0, 119]. If it does, it prints the fianl value of variable when as output, which is 105.
