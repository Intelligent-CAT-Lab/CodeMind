variable str1 is initialized with null.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string str1. The value of variable i is also passed to variable intCnt1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string str1 is equal to the character '0' or '1'. If it is, it increments variable intCnt1 by 1.
Then it checks if the current character of the string str1 is equal to the character '0' or '1'. If it is, it increments variable intCnt2 by 1.
Then it checks if the current character of the string str1 is equal to the character '0' or '1'. If it is, it increments variable intCnt1 by 1.
Then it checks if the current character of the string str1 is equal to the character '0' or '1'. If it is, it increments variable intCnt2 by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable intCnt1 or intCnt2 as output, which is 0.
