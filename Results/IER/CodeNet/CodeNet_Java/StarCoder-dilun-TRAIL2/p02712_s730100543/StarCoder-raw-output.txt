 variable N is initialized with 15.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is divisible by 3 and 5. If it is not, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int sum = 0;

		for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {

			if(i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0) {
				sum = sum + i;
			}
		}

		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```15
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
