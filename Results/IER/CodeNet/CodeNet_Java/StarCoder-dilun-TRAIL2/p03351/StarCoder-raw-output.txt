he variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 4, 7, 9 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the absolute value of the difference between a and b, a and c, b and c and stores them in variables ab, ac and bc respectively.
Then it checks if the absolute value of the difference between a and c is less than or equal to d or if the absolute value of the difference between a and b is less than or equal to d and the absolute value of the difference between b and c is less than or equal to d.
If the condition is met, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int d = sc.nextInt();
        int ab = Math.abs(a-b);
        int ac = Math.abs(a-c);
        int bc = Math.abs(b-c);
        if(ac <= d || (ab <= d && bc <= d)){
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else{
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 7 9 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 4, 7, 9 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the absolute value of the difference between a and b, a and c, b and c and stores them in variables ab, ac and bc respectively.
Then it checks if the absolute value of the difference between a and c is less than or equal to d or if the absolute value of the difference between a and b is less than or equal to d and the absolute value of the difference between b and c is less than or equal to d.
