he variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 4, 7, 9 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the absolute value of the difference between a and b, a and c, b and c and stores them in variables ab, ac and bc respectively.
Then it checks if the absolute value of the difference between a and c is less than or equal to d or if the absolute value of the difference between a and b is less than or equal to d and the absolute value of the difference between b and c is less than or equal to d.
If the condition is met, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
