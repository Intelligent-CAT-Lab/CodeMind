he variable l is initialized with 2 and variable r is initialized with 3.
The variable n is initialized with the number of bits in the binary representation of r.
The variable dp is initialized with a 4-dimensional array with the first dimension being the number of bits in the binary representation of r, the second dimension being 2, the third dimension being 2 and the fourth dimension being 2.
The value of dp[0][0][0][0] is set to 1.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each value of x.
Inside the for loop, it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each value of y.
Inside the for loop, it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each value of msb.
Inside the for loop, it checks if x is 1 or if the i-th bit of l is 0.
If either of these conditions is true, it adds the value of dp[i-1][x][y | getBit(r, i-1)][msb] to the value of dp[i][x][y][msb].
If either of these conditions is true, it adds the value of dp[i-1][x | (1-getBit(l, i-1))][y][1] to the value of dp[i][x][y][msb].
If all of these conditions are true, it adds the value of dp[i-1][x][y][1] to the value of dp[i][x][y][msb].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of dp[n][0][0][0] as output, which is 2.
