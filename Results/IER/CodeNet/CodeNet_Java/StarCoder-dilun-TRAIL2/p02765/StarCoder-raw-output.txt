he variable n is initialized with 2 and variable r is initialized with 2919.
The if statement checks if n is less than 10. If it is, it prints the sum of r and 100 minus n.
If n is not less than 10, it prints the value of r.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int r = sc.nextInt();
        if(n < 10){
            System.out.println(r+ (10 - n) * 100);
        
        }else{
            System.out.println(r);
        }
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2919
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
