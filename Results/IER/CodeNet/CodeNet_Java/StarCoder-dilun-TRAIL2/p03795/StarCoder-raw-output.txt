he variable n is initialized with 20 according to the input.
It calculates the final value of variable n by multiplying it with 800 and subtracting the result from the product of n divided by 15 and 200.
<<<Output>>>
1600

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args)throws IOException{
		InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
		BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(isr);

		int n;
		n = Integer.parseInt(reader.readLine());

		System.out.println(n * 2);

		reader.close();
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 20 according to the input.
It calculates the final value of variable n by multiplying it with 2.
<<<Output>>>
40
