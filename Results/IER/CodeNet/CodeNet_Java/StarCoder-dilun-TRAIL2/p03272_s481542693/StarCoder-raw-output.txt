he variable n is initialized with 4 and variable i is initialized with 2.
The code subtracts i from n and prints the result as output.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int i = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(n-i);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 and variable i is initialized with 2.
The code subtracts i from n and prints the result as output.
