he variable s is initialized with the input string "0011".
The variable len is initialized with the length of the input string s.
The variable countRed is initialized with the length of the string s after removing all the characters "0".
The variable countBlue is initialized with the length of the string s after removing all the characters "1".
The variable result is initialized with the minimum of countRed and countBlue multiplied by 2.
The output is the value of variable result, which is 4.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String args[]) {

        // 入力
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();

        // 主処理
        int len = s.length();
        int countRed = len - s.replace("0", "").length();
        int countBlue = len - s.replace("1", "").length();
        int result = Math.min(countRed, countBlue) * 2;

        // 出力
        System.out.println(result);
        sc.close();
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```00110011
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
