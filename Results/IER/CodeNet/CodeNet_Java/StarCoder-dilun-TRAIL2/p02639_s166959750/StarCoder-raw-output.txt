he variable a is initialized with the array [0, 2, 3, 4, 5] according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is equal to 0. If it is, it sets the value of variable x to i+1. The condition is met when i is 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		int a[]=new int[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		a[i]=sc.nextInt();
		int x=0;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		if(a[i]==0)
		{
		    x=i+1;
		    break;
		}
		System.out.println(x);
	}

}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
