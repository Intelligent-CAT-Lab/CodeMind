he variable s is initialized with the input.
It checks if the variable s matches the regular expression "^A?KIHA?BA?RA?$".
The regular expression is a pattern that matches a given string.
The pattern is specified by a sequence of characters.
The characters in the pattern can be:
-	A single character
-	A character followed by a question mark
-	A character followed by a star
The pattern is matched if the string matches all the characters in the pattern.
The question mark means that the character before it is optional.
The star means that the character before it can be repeated zero or more times.
The pattern ^A?KIHA?BA?RA?$ means that the string must start with A, K, I, H, B, R or A.
The pattern is followed by a dollar sign $, which means that the string must end with A, K, I, H, B, R or A.
The string KIHBR matches the pattern, so the output is YES.
