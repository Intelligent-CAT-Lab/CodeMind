he variable e is initialized with 5 elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable e[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if the following conditions are met:
1. e[1] == e[2] && e[3] == e[4]
2. e[1] == e[4] && e[2] == e[3]
3. e[1] == e[3] && e[2] == e[4]
If any of the above conditions are met, it prints "yes" as output.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "no" as output.
