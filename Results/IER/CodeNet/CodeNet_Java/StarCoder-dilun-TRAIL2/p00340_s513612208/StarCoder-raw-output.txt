he variable e is initialized with 5 elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable e[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if the following conditions are met:
1. e[1] == e[2] && e[3] == e[4]
2. e[1] == e[4] && e[2] == e[3]
3. e[1] == e[3] && e[2] == e[4]
If any of the above conditions are met, it prints "yes" as output.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "no" as output.
<<<Output>>>
yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int e[] = new int[5] ;
        for(int i = 1;i<=4;i++){
            e[i] = scan.nextInt();
        }
        if(e[1]==e[2]&&e[3]==e[4]||e[1]==e[4]&&e[2]==e[3]||e[1]==e[3]&&e[2]==e[4]){
            System.out.println("yes");
    } else {
    System.out.println("no");
    }
}
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
