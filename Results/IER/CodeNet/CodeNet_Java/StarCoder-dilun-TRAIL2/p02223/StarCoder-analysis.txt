he variable N is initialized with 2.
The if statement checks if N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 and 0 as output.
The else if statement checks if N is equal to 2. If it is, it prints 2 and 0 and 11 as output.
The else statement is executed. It prints N-1 as the number of lines of output. Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to N to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it creates an array of size i and fills it with '1'. Then it changes the first and last elements of the array to '0' and the middle element to '1'.
Then it prints the array as output.
