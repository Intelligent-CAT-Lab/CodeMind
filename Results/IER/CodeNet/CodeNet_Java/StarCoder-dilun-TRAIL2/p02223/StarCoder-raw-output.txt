he variable N is initialized with 2.
The if statement checks if N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 and 0 as output.
The else if statement checks if N is equal to 2. If it is, it prints 2 and 0 and 11 as output.
The else statement is executed. It prints N-1 as the number of lines of output. Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to N to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it creates an array of size i and fills it with '1'. Then it changes the first and last elements of the array to '0' and the middle element to '1'.
Then it prints the array as output.
<<<Output>>>
2
0
11

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[N];
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int[] arr2 = new int[N];
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			arr2[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int[] arr3 = new int[N];
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			arr3[i] = arr[i] + arr2[i];
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
			System.out.println(arr3[i]);
		}
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1
2
3
4
5
6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3.
Then it creates an array
