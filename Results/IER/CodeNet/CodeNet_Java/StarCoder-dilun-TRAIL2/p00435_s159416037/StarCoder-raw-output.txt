he variable arr is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the array arr.
Inside the for loop, it converts the current character of the array arr to its corresponding character in the alphabet.
The conversion is done by subtracting the current character from 'A' and adding 3. Then it modifies the value to be within the range [0, 25]. Then it adds 'A' to the modified value to get the corresponding character in the alphabet.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable arr as output, which is MRL.
<<<Output>>>
MRL

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String str = sc.next();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            if (str.charAt(i) == 'a' || str.charAt(i) == 'e' || str.charAt(i) == 'i' || str.charAt(i) == 'o' || str.charAt(i) == 'u') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```apple```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string str.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string str is equal to 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' or 'u'. If it is, it increments the value of variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
