he variable arr is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the array arr.
Inside the for loop, it converts the current character of the array arr to its corresponding character in the alphabet.
The conversion is done by subtracting the current character from 'A' and adding 3. Then it modifies the value to be within the range [0, 25]. Then it adds 'A' to the modified value to get the corresponding character in the alphabet.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable arr as output, which is MRL.
