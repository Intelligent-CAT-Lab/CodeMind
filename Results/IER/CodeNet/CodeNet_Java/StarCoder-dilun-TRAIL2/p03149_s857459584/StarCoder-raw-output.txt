he variable n1, n2, n3 and n4 are initialized with 1, 7, 9 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the values of n1, n2, n3 and n4 are 1, 7, 9 and 4 respectively. If they are, it prints "YES" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Scanner;


public class Main {

	private static Scanner sc;
	private static Printer pr;

	private static void solve() {
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}

		int[] dp = new int[n];
		dp[0] = arr[0];
		dp[1] = Math.max(arr[0], arr[1]);
		for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
			dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 2] + arr[i], dp[i - 1]);
		}

		pr.println(dp[n - 1]);
	}

	// ---------------------------------------------------
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		pr = new Printer(System.out);
			
		solve();
			
		pr.close();
		sc.close();
	}

	static class Printer extends PrintWriter {
		Printer(OutputStream out) {
			super(out);
		}
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It initializes an array of size n with all elements initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n -
