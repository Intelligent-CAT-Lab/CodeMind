he variable X is initialized with 1.
The value of variable X is divided by 7 and the remainder is checked.
If the remainder is 4, it prints "mon" as output.
If the remainder is 5, it prints "tue" as output.
If the remainder is 6, it prints "wed" as output.
If the remainder is 0, it prints "thu" as output.
If the remainder is 1, it prints "fri" as output.
If the remainder is 2, it prints "sat" as output.
If the remainder is 3, it prints "sun" as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
        int X =scan.nextInt();
        switch(X%7){
            case 4:
                System.out.println("mon");
                break;
            case 5:
                System.out.println("tue");
                break;
            case 6:
                System.out.println("wed");
                break;
            case 0:
                System.out.println("thu");
                break;
            case 1:
                System.out.println("fri");
                break;
            case 2:
                System.out.println("sat");
                break;
            case 3:
                System.out.println("sun");
                break;    
        }

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 2.
The value of variable X is divided by 7 and the remainder is checked.
If the remainder is 4, it prints "mon" as output.
If the remainder is 5, it prints "tue" as output.
If the remainder is 6, it prints "wed" as output.
If the remainder is 0, it prints "thu" as output.
If the remainder is 1, it
