he variable x is initialized with 615 according to the input.
It checks if the remainder of x divided by 100 is less than or equal to the product of x divided by 100 and 5.
If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If it is not, it prints 0 as output.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        @SuppressWarnings("resource")
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = sc.nextInt();
        if (x % 100 <= x / 100 * 5) {
            System.out.println(1);
        } else {
            System.out.println(0);
        }
    }

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```616
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 616 according to the input.
It checks if the remainder of x divided by 100 is less than or equal to the product of x divided by 100 and 5.
If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If it is not, it prints 0 as output.
<<<Output>>>
