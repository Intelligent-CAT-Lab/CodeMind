he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2.
The for loop iterates from 0 to k and calculates the value of variable combination and variable combination2.
The value of variable combination is calculated by multiplying the factorial of n with the product of the inverse of factorial of i and the inverse of factorial of n minus i.
The value of variable combination2 is calculated by multiplying the factorial of n minus 1 with the product of the inverse of factorial of n minus i minus 1 and the inverse of factorial of i.
The value of variable answer is calculated by adding the product of variable combination and variable combination2 to the value of variable answer.
The value of variable answer is then printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int k = sc.nextInt();
		sc.close();

		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = i + 1;
		}

		int[] arr2 = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr2[i] = i + 1;
		}

		int[] arr3 = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr3[i] = i + 1;
		}

		int[] arr4 = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr4[i] = i + 1;
		}

		int[] arr5 = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr5[i] = i + 1;
		}

		int[] arr6 = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr6[i] = i
