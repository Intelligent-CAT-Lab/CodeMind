he variable w is initialized with the input string "abaccaba".
The variable c is initialized with an array of size 7.
The variable a is initialized with an array of size 1000.
The variable flag is initialized with true.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 6 to initialize the array c with the characters of the string w.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 6 to initialize the array a with the number of times each character appears in the string w.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 999 to check if the number of times each character appears in the string w is even.
If the number of times each character appears in the string w is even, the flag is set to false.
If the flag is false, the output is "No".
If the flag is true, the output is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = scan.nextInt();
		int[] a = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			a[i] = scan.nextInt();
		}
		int[] b = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			b[i] = scan.nextInt();
		}
		int[] c = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			System.out.println(c[i]);
		}
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10 11
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your
