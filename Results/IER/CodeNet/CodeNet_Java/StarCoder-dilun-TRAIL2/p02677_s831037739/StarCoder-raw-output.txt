he variable A, variable B, variable H and variable M are initialized with 3, 4, 9 and 0 respectively according to the input.
The variable mins is initialized with 60*H+M, which is 540.
The variable M_angle is initialized with M*6, which is 0.
The variable H_angle is initialized with mins*0.5, which is 270.
The variable x1 is initialized with A*Math.cos(Math.toRadians(H_angle)), which is 3*Math.cos(Math.toRadians(270)).
The variable y1 is initialized with A*Math.sin(Math.toRadians(H_angle)), which is 3*Math.sin(Math.toRadians(270)).
The variable x2 is initialized with B*Math.cos(Math.toRadians(M_angle)), which is 4*Math.cos(Math.toRadians(0)).
The variable y2 is initialized with B*Math.sin(Math.toRadians(M_angle)), which is 4*Math.sin(Math.toRadians(0)).
The final output is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the square of the difference of x1 and x2 and the square of the difference of y1 and y2.
The final output is 5.0.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        StringTokenizer st  = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());

        int N = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
        int K = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());

        int[] arr = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            arr[i] = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (arr[i] % K == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(count);
