he variable x is initialized with 100 and variable t is initialized with 17.
The if statement checks if variable x is greater than variable t. If it is, it prints the difference between x and t.
If it is not, it checks if variable x is less than or equal to variable t. If it is, it prints 0.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
		int x=scan.nextInt(),t=scan.nextInt();
		if(x>t) {
			System.out.println(x-t);
		}
		else if(x<=t) {
			System.out.println("0");
		}

	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100 17
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
