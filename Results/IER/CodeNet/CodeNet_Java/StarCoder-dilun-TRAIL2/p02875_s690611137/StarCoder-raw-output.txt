e variable n is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable res by repeatedlly multiplying it by 3.
Then it calculates the value of variable p2 by repeatedlly multiplying it by 2.
Then it calculates the value of variable res by subtracting the product of the following:
1. The product of the following:
a. The value of variable facts[n]
b. The value of variable invfacts[na]
c. The value of variable invfacts[n-na]
2. The value of variable p2
Then it prints the final value of variable res as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
