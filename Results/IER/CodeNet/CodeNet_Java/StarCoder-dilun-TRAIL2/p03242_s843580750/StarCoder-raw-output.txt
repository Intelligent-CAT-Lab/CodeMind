he variable N is initialized with 119.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of variable N is equal to 1 or 9. If it is, it prints 9 or 1 respectively.
Otherwise, it prints the character at index i of variable N.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable N as output, which is 191.
<<<Output>>>
191

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int M = sc.nextInt();
		int K = sc.nextInt();

		int sum = 0;

		for (int i = N; i <= M; i++) {
			if (i % K == 0) {
				sum += i;
			}
		}

		System.out.println(sum);

	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 10 3```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, M and K are initialized with 1, 10 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by 3. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 18.
<<<Output>>>
18
