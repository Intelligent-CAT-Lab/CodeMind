he variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the absolute value of n minus m is greater than 1. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it initializes the array x with 100001 elements. The first element is 1, and the rest of the elements are calculated by multiplying the previous element by i.
Then it calculates the final answer by multiplying the product of x[n] and x[m] and then modding it by a.
If n equals m, it doubles the answer and then modding it by a.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  int n = sc.nextInt();
  int m = sc.nextInt();
  long[] x = new long[100001];
  int a = 1000000007;
  if (Math.abs(n - m) > 1) {
    System.out.println('0');
    return;
  }
  x[0] = 1;
  for(int i = 1; i <= 100000; i++)x[i] = x[i - 1] * i % a;
  long ans = x[n] * x[m] % a;
  if(n == m) ans = ans * 2 % a;
  System.out.println(ans);
  return;
}}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
