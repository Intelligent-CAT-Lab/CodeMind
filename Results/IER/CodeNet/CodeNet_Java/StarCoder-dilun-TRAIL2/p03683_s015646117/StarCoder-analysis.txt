he variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the absolute value of n minus m is greater than 1. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
Otherwise, it initializes the array x with 100001 elements. The first element is 1, and the rest of the elements are calculated by multiplying the previous element by i.
Then it calculates the final answer by multiplying the product of x[n] and x[m] and then modding it by a.
If n equals m, it doubles the answer and then modding it by a.
