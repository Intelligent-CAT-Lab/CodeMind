he variable s is initialized with the input string.
The replace method replaces all the characters '?' in the string with 'D'.
The final value of variable s is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String args[]) {

        // 入力
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        sc.close();

        // 主処理
        String result = s.replace("?", "D");

        // 出力
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```PD?D??P
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
