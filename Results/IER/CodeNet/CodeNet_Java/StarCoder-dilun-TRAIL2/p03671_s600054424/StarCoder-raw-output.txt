he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 700, 600 and 780 respectively according to the input.
The variable result is initialized with 0.
It calculates the value of variable result by adding the values of variables a, b and c and subtracting the maximum value of variables a, b and c.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable result as output, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import static java.lang.Math.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		// 入力
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		
		// 計算
		int result = 0;
		result = a+b+c-max(a, max(b, c));
		
		// 出力
		System.out.println(result);
	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```700 600 780
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
