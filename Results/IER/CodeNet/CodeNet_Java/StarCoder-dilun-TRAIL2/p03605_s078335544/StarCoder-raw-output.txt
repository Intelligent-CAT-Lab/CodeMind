he variable x is initialized with 29.
The variable s is initialized with the string representation of x.
The if statement checks if x is between 10 and 99.
If it is, it checks if the string representation of x contains the digit 9.
If it does, it prints "Yes" as output.
If it does not, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = input.nextInt();
        int y = input.nextInt();
        int z = input.nextInt();
        if (x > y && x > z) {
            System.out.println(x);
        } else if (y > x && y > z) {
            System.out.println(y);
        } else {
            System.out.println(z);
        }
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 1.
The variable y is initialized with 2.
The variable z is initialized with 3.
The if statement checks if x is greater than y and x is greater than z.
If it is, it prints x as output.
If it is not, it checks if y is greater than x and y is greater than z.
If it is, it prints y as output.
If it is not, it prints z as output.
<<<Output>>>
