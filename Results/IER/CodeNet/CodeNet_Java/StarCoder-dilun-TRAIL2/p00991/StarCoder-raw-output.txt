he variable r, c, a1, a2, b1 and b2 are initialized with 4, 4, 0, 0, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the absolute difference between a1 and b1 and stores it in variable x. It also calculates the absolute difference between a2 and b2 and stores it in variable y.
Then it calculates the minimum of x and r-x and stores it in variable x. It also calculates the minimum of y and c-y and stores it in variable y.
Then it calculates the minimum of x and y and stores it in variable C.
Then it calculates the value of variable b by multiplying the value of variable b by the value of variable b. It also divides the value of variable b by the value of variable b.
Then it calculates the value of variable b by multiplying the value of variable b by the value of variable z.
Then it calculates the value of variable b by taking the modulus of the value of variable b with the value of variable 100000007.
Then it prints the value of variable b as output.
