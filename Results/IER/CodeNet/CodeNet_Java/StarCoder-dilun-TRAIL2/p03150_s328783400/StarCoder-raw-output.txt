he variable str is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable pat1 and pat2.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current string str is equal to the substring of pat1[i]. If it is, it checks if the substring of str from the end is equal to the substring of pat2[i]. If it is, it prints "YES" and breaks the loop.
If the loop finishes without breaking, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String str = sc.next();

        String[] pat1 = { "keyence", "k",      "ke",    "key",  "keye", "keyen", "keyenc" };
        String[] pat2 = { "",        "eyence", "yence", "ence", "nce",  "ce",    "e"};

        boolean flg = true;

        for(int i = 0; i < 7; i++){
            if(pat1[i].equals(str.substring(0,pat1[i].length()))){
                if(pat2[i].equals(str.substring(str.length() - pat2[i].length(), str.length()))){
                    System.out.println("YES");
                    flg = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        if(flg){
            System.out.println("NO");
        }
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```keyence
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable pat1 and pat2.
Inside the for loop, it checks if
