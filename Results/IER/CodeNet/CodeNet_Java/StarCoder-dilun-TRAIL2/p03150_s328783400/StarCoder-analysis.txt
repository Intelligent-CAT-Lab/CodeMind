he variable str is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable pat1 and pat2.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current string str is equal to the substring of pat1[i]. If it is, it checks if the substring of str from the end is equal to the substring of pat2[i]. If it is, it prints "YES" and breaks the loop.
If the loop finishes without breaking, it prints "NO".
