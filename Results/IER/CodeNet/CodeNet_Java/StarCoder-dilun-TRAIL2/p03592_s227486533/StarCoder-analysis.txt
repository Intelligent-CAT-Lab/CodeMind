variable n, variable m and variable k are initialized with 2, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer p1 in this range. The value of variable p1 is also passed to variable q.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable p1*m+q*n-2*p1*q. The condition is met when p1*m+q*n-2*p1*q is 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is Yes.
