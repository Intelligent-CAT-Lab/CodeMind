he variable a and variable b are initialized with -13 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable max is initialized with the sum of a and b.
Then it checks if the calculated variable max is less than the difference of a and b. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the difference of a and b.
Then it checks if the calculated variable max is less than the product of a and b. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the product of a and b.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 12.
