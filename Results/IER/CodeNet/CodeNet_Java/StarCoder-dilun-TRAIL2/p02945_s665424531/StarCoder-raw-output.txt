he variable a and variable b are initialized with -13 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable max is initialized with the sum of a and b.
Then it checks if the calculated variable max is less than the difference of a and b. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the difference of a and b.
Then it checks if the calculated variable max is less than the product of a and b. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the product of a and b.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
  public static void main(String args[]){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nextInt();
    int max = a+b;
    if(max<a-b)max = a-b;   
    if(max<a*b)max = a*b;
    System.out.println(max);
  } 
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-13 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
