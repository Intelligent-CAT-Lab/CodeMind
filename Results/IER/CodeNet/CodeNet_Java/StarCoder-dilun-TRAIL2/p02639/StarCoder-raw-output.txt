he variable x is initialized with 5 integers.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x[i].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of all the integers in the array x.
Then it prints the difference between 15 and the calculated sum as output, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int[] x = new int[5];
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
            x[i] = sc.nextInt();
            sum += x[i];
        }
        System.out.println(15-sum);
    }

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
