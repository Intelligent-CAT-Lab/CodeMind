he variable x is initialized with 5 integers.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x[i].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of all the integers in the array x.
Then it prints the difference between 15 and the calculated sum as output, which is 1.
