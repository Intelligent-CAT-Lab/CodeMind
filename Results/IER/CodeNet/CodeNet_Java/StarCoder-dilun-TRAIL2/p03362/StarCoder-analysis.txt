he variable N is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 6 to 55555 by adding 5 to i in each iteration.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is a prime number. If it is, it prints the value of i and increases the value of variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 5.
