he variable N is initialized with 6 and variable D is initialized with 2.
The value of variable ans is calculated by dividing the value of variable N by the product of variable D and 2 plus 1.
The value of variable ans is rounded up to the nearest integer.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		final int N = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
		final int D = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());

		int ans = 0;
		for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
			if (i % D == 0) {
				ans += i;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans);


	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 6 and variable D is initialized with 2.
The value of variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by variable D. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
