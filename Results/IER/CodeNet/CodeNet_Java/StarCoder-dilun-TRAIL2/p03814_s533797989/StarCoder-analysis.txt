he variable s is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the last index of the string to the first index of the string to check each character in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable words.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'A'. If it is, it updates the value of variable min to the current index i.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from the first index of the string to the last index of the string to check each character in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable words.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'Z'. If it is, it updates the value of variable max to the current index i.
After the loop finishes, it print the difference of variable max and variable min plus 1 as output, which is 10.
