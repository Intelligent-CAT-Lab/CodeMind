he variable s is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the last index of the string to the first index of the string to check each character in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable words.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'A'. If it is, it updates the value of variable min to the current index i.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from the first index of the string to the last index of the string to check each character in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable words.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'Z'. If it is, it updates the value of variable max to the current index i.
After the loop finishes, it print the difference of variable max and variable min plus 1 as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = stdIn.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = stdIn.nextInt();
		}
		int max = arr[0];
		for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			if(arr[i] > max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max);

	}

}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from
