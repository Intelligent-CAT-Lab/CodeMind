variable s is initialized with the input string "aabxyyzz".
It enters a for loop and it iterates over each character c in the string s.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the XOR of the current character c with the previous character c.
Then it calculates the XOR of the current character c with all the characters in the string s.
Then it checks if the calculated XOR value is already present in the hashmap dp. If it is, it adds 1 to the value of the key code in the hashmap dp.
If the calculated XOR value is not present in the hashmap dp, it adds the calculated XOR value to the hashmap dp with the key code as the key.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of the key code in the hashmap dp as output, which is 3.
