he variable inputString is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each string str in the list inputString.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current string str to the set removeDuplication.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the size of the list inputString is equal to the size of the set removeDuplication. If it is, it prints "yes" as output.
