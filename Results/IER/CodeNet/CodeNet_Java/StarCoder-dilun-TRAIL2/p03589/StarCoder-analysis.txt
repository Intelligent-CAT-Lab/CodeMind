he variable N is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3500 to check each integer h in this range. The value of variable h is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3500 to check each integer n in this range. The value of variable n is also passed to variable h.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of the expression (N*h*n)/(4*h*n-N*n-N*h) and (N*h*n)%(4*h*n-N*n-N*h).
If the expression is not equal to 0 and the remainder of the expression is 0, it prints the values of h, n and the expression as output.
