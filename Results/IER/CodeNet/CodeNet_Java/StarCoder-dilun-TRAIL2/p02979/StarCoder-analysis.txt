n, variable k and variable mod are initialized with 3, 1 and 998244353 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 times.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to k times.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable res by adding variable a and variable b.
Then it checks if the calculated variable res is greater than or equal to variable mod. If it is, it subtracts variable mod from the calculated variable res.
Then it returns the calculated variable res as output.
