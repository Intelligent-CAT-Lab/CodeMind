e variable k is initialized with 7.
The variable s is initialized with "FESTIVA".
The variable idx is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it checks if k is greater than 0 and if idx is less than 4.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the base value of the current iteration of the while loop.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from base to 100 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable base.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger base by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [k % base, k % base]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to idx to check each integer pos in this range. The value of variable pos is also passed to variable base.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger base by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [k % base, k % base]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 4 to 0 to check each integer pos in this range. The value of variable pos is also passed to variable base.
