variable S is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the string S. The value of variable k is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it initializes two strings, mins and maxs, with the first k characters of the string S.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string S. The value of variable s is also passed to variable s.
Inside the for loop, it initializes a string, tmp, with the characters of the string S from s to s+k.
Then it checks if the current string tmp is greater than the current string maxs. If it is, it updates the value of maxs with the current string tmp.
Then it checks if the current string tmp is less than the current string mins. If it is, it updates the value of mins with the current string tmp.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the string S. The value of variable k is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it initializes two strings, mins and maxs, with the first k characters of the string S.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string S. The value of variable s is also passed to variable s.
Inside the for loop, it initializes a string, tmp, with the characters of the string S from s to s+k.
Then it checks if the current string tmp is greater than the current string maxs. If it is, it updates the value of maxs with the current string tmp.
Then it checks if the current string tmp is less than the current string mins. If it is, it updates the value of mins with the current string tmp.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string S. The value of variable p is also passed to variable p.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable v by extracting the value of the current character of the string S at position p.
Then it checks if the current character of the string S at position p is '1' and if p+1 is less than the length of the string S. If it is, it calculates the value of variable v as 10 + the value of the current character of the string S at position p+1.
Then it checks if the current value of variable v is greater than the current value of variable maxv. If it is, it updates the value of maxv with the current value of variable v.
Then it checks if the current value of variable v is less than the current value of variable minv. If it is, it updates the value of minv with the current value of variable v.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of variable ans as the minimum of the values of maxv and minv.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
