 variable A is initialized with 3 and variable B is initialized with 1.
The if statement checks if A is equal to 2 and B is equal to 2. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int A = sc.nextInt();
		int B = sc.nextInt();
		sc.close();
 
		if (A == 2 && B == 2) {
			System.out.println("Yes");
		} else {
			System.out.println("No");
		}
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
