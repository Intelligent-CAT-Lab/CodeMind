he variable s is initialized with the input string.
The replaceAll method replaces all occurrences of a substring with another substring.
The substring to be replaced is a comma and the replacement is a space.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {
			int n = scanner.nextInt();
			int[] arr = new int[n];
			for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
				arr[i] = scanner.nextInt();
			}
			int max = arr[0];
			for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
				if (arr[i] > max) {
					max = arr[i];
				}
			}
			System.out.println(max);
		}
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of size n.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n-1 to initialize each element of the array arr with the input integer.
The variable max is initialized with the first element of the array arr.
The for loop iterates from 1 to n-1 to check if the current element of the array arr is greater than the variable max. If it is, it updates the variable max with the current element of the array arr.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable max as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
