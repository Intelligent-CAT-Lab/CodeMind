he variable N is initialized with 101.
The variable l is initialized with the length of the string representation of N.
The variable m is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to l-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable m.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable m by repeatedlly multiplying it by 10 and adding 7.
Then it checks if the calculated variable m is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the value of variable i as output, which is 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters a while loop and it iterates until the condition is met.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the value of variable m is already present in the array of boolean variables vis. If it is, it prints -1 as output.
If the condition is not met, it calculates the value of variable m by repeatedlly multiplying it by 10 and adding 7.
Then it increments the value of variable i by 1.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of variable i as output, which is 2.
