he variable N is initialized with 101.
The variable l is initialized with the length of the string representation of N.
The variable m is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to l-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable m.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable m by repeatedlly multiplying it by 10 and adding 7.
Then it checks if the calculated variable m is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the value of variable i as output, which is 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters a while loop and it iterates until the condition is met.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the value of variable m is already present in the array of boolean variables vis. If it is, it prints -1 as output.
If the condition is not met, it calculates the value of variable m by repeatedlly multiplying it by 10 and adding 7.
Then it increments the value of variable i by 1.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of variable i as output, which is 2.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		setIO();

		int N = ni();
		
		int l = Integer.toString(N).length();
		int m = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < l; i++) {
			m = (10 * m + 7) % N;
		}
		
		int i = l;
		boolean[] vis = new boolean[N];
		
		while (true) {
			if (vis[m]) {
				out.println(-1);
				break;
			}
			
			vis[m] = true;
			
			if (m == 0) {
				out.println(i);
				break;
			}
			
			m = (10 * m + 7) % N;
			i++;
		}
		
		f.close();
		out.close();
