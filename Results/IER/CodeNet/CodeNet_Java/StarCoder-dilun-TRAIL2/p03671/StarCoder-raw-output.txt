he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 700, 600 and 780 respectively according to the input.
The array sum is initialized with the values of variables a, b and c.
The method Arrays.sort() sorts the array sum in ascending order.
The first and second elements of the array sum are added and printed as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();

        int[] sum = {a,b,c};
        Arrays.sort(sum);

        System.out.println(sum[0]*sum[1]);
    }

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```700 600 780
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
