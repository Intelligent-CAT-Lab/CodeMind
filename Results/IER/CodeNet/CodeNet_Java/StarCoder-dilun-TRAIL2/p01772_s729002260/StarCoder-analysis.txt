variable line is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates over each character c in the string line.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'A' and variable a is true. If it is, it sets variable a to false.
Then it checks if the current character c is 'Z' and variable a is false. If it is, it appends "AZ" to the string builder sb.
Then it checks if the length of the string builder sb is not 0. If it is, it prints the string builder sb as output.
If the length of the string builder sb is 0, it prints -1 as output.
