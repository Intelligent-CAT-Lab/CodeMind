 variable line is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates over each character c in the string line.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'A' and variable a is true. If it is, it sets variable a to false.
Then it checks if the current character c is 'Z' and variable a is false. If it is, it appends "AZ" to the string builder sb.
Then it checks if the length of the string builder sb is not 0. If it is, it prints the string builder sb as output.
If the length of the string builder sb is 0, it prints -1 as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

/**
 * A-Z Cat
 */
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String line;
		String[] words;

		line = br.readLine();

		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
		boolean a = true;

		for (char c : line.toCharArray()) {
			if (c == 'A' && a) {
				a = false;
			}
			if (c == 'Z' &&!a) {
				sb.append("AZ");
				a = true;
			}
		}

		if (sb.length()!= 0) {
			System.out.println(sb.toString());
		} else {
			System.out.println(-1);
		}
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```AIZUNYANPEROPERO
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
