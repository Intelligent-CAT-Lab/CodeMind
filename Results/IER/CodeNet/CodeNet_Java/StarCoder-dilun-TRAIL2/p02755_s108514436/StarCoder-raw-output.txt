he variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The function solve() is called with parameters A and B.
The function solve() enters a while loop and it iterates from 1 to MAX_VALUE to check each integer mid in this range. The value of variable mid is also passed to the function consumptionRate() with parameter 8.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the consumption rate of the current interger mid by calling the function consumptionRate() with parameter mid and 10.
Then it checks if the calculated consumption rates of 8 and 10 are equal to the parameters A and B. If it does, it assigns the current interger mid to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
