he variable n is initialized with 18.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of n.
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it adds -i and -n/i to the TreeSet nums.
After the loop finishes, it initializes two variables min and max with 0 and 1 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates over the TreeSet nums.
Inside the for loop, it initializes a variable x with the current element of the TreeSet nums.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of -x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if -x is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i and -x/i to the HashSet used.
After the loop finishes, it increments the value of variable min by 1.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the values of variables min and max as output, which is 2 3.
