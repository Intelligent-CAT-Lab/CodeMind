he variable n is initialized with 18.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of n.
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it adds -i and -n/i to the TreeSet nums.
After the loop finishes, it initializes two variables min and max with 0 and 1 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates over the TreeSet nums.
Inside the for loop, it initializes a variable x with the current element of the TreeSet nums.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of -x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if -x is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i and -x/i to the HashSet used.
After the loop finishes, it increments the value of variable min by 1.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the values of variables min and max as output, which is 2 3.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int max = 0;
        int min = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count > max) {
                max = count;
            }
            if (count < min) {
                min = count;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(max + " " + min);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
