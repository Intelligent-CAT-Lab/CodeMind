he variable A is initialized with 3, variable B is initialized with 4, variable H is initialized with 9 and variable M is initialized with 0.
The value of variable H is multiplied by 30 and added to variable M to get the value of variable H1.
The value of variable A is multiplied by the sine of the value of variable H1 to get the value of variable H2.
The value of variable B is multiplied by the sine of the value of variable M to get the value of variable M1.
The value of variable B is multiplied by the cosine of the value of variable M to get the value of variable M2.
The value of variable H1 is subtracted from the value of variable M1 to get the value of variable H1.
The value of variable H2 is subtracted from the value of variable M2 to get the value of variable H2.
The value of variable H1 is subtracted from the value of variable H2 to get the value of variable H1.
The value of variable H1 is squared to get the value of variable H1.
The value of variable H2 is squared to get the value of variable H2.
The value of variable H1 is added to the value of variable H2 to get the value of variable H1.
The square root of the value of variable H1 is printed as output.
