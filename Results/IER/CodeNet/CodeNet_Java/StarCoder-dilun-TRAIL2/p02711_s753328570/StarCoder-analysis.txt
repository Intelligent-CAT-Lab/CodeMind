he variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable flag.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of variable s is equal to '7'. If it is, it sets the value of variable flag to 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable flag is 1. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
