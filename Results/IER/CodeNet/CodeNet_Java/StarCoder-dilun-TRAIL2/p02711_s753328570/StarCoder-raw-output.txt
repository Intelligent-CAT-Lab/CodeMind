he variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable flag.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of variable s is equal to '7'. If it is, it sets the value of variable flag to 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable flag is 1. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

class Main
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		BufferedReader bu=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String s=bu.readLine();
		int i,flag=0;
		for(i=0;i<s.length();i++)
		if(s.charAt(i)=='7') {flag=1; break;}
		if(flag==1) System.out.print("Yes");
		else System.out.print("No");
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```117
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable flag.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of variable s is equal to '7'. If it is, it sets the value of variable flag to 1.
