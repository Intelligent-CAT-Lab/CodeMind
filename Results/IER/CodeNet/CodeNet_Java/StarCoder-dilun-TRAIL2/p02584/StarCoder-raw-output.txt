he variable x is initialized with 6, variable k is initialized with 2 and variable d is initialized with 4.
The absolute value of variable x is calculated and stored in variable absX.
Then it checks if the absolute value of variable x divided by variable d is greater than or equal to variable k.
If it is, it calculates the difference between the absolute value of variable x and variable k multiplied by variable d and stores it in variable ans.
Otherwise, it calculates the quotient of the absolute value of variable x divided by variable d and stores it in variable sho.
Then it calculates the remainder of the absolute value of variable x divided by variable d and stores it in variable amari.
If the remainder is 0, it means that the absolute value of variable x is divisible by variable d.
So it calculates the difference between the absolute value of variable x and variable d and stores it in variable ans.
Otherwise, it calculates the difference between the absolute value of variable d and the remainder and stores it in variable ans.
After the calculations, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scan.nextInt();
        int k = scan.nextInt();
        int d = scan.nextInt();
        scan.close();

        int ans = 0;
        int absN = Math.abs(n);
        if (absN / d >= k) {
            ans = absN - k * d;
        } else {
            int sho = absN / d;
            int amari = absN % d;
            if ((k - sho) % 2 == 0) {
                ans = amari;
            } else {
                ans = d - amari;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 2 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
