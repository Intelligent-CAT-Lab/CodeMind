he variable a is initialized with 6 elements. The first 6 elements are initialized with the input.
The variable b is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a[]=new int[6];
		int b=0;
		for(int i=0;i<6;i++){
			a[i]=stdIn.nextInt();
		}
		b=a[0]+a[1]*5+a[2]*10+a[3]*50+a[4]*100+a[5]*500;
		if(1000<=b)
			System.out.println("1");
		else
			System.out.println("0");
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 4 0 4 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 6 elements. The first 6 elements are initialized with the input.
The variable b is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from
