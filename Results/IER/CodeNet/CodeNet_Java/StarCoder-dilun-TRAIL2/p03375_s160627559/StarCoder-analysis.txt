variable N is initialized with 2 and variable M is initialized with 1000000007.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable sum by iterating from 0 to i and adding the value of variable f[i][k] to it.
Then it calculates the value of variable ans by iterating from 0 to N and adding the value of variable comb[N][i] to it.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1000000007.
