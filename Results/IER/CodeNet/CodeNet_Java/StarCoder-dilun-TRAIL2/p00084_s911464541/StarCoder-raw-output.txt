he variable arr is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each string s in the array arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the length of string s is greater than 2 and less than 7. If it does, it appends the string s to the variable sb.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable sb as output, which is Rain Spain.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
    	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    	int n = sc.nextInt();
    	int[] arr = new int[n];
    	for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    		arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
    	int max = arr[0];
    	for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    		if(arr[i] > max)
    			max = arr[i];
    	System.out.println(max);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
The variable arr is initialized with an array of size 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to initialize each element of the array arr with the input.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each element of the array arr.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current element of the array arr is greater than the variable max. If it does, it updates the variable max with the current element of the array arr.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable max as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
