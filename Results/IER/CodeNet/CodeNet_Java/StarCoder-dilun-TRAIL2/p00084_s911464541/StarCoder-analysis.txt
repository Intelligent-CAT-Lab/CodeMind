he variable arr is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each string s in the array arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the length of string s is greater than 2 and less than 7. If it does, it appends the string s to the variable sb.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable sb as output, which is Rain Spain.
