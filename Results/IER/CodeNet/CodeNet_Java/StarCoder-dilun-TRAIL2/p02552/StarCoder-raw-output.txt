he variable n is initialized with 1.
It checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1.
If n is not equal to 0, it prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

/**

 */
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		if(n==0)
			System.out.println("1");
		else
			System.out.println("0");
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
