he variable N is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string N. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is even or odd. If it is even, it checks if the current character c is 'L'. If it is, it prints "No" and breaks the loop.
If it is odd, it checks if the current character c is 'R'. If it is, it prints "No" and breaks the loop.
If it is neither even nor odd, it checks if the current interger i is the last interger of the string N. If it is, it prints "Yes".
