he variable N is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string N. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is even or odd. If it is even, it checks if the current character c is 'L'. If it is, it prints "No" and breaks the loop.
If it is odd, it checks if the current character c is 'R'. If it is, it prints "No" and breaks the loop.
If it is neither even nor odd, it checks if the current interger i is the last interger of the string N. If it is, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
No

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String N = sc.next();

		for (int i = 0; i < N.length(); i++) {
			char c = N.charAt(i);
			if (c == 'L') {
				System.out.println("No");
				break;
			}
			if (i == N.length() - 1) {
				System.out.println("Yes");
			}
		}
	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```RUDLUDR
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
