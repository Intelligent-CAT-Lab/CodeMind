e variable x and variable y are initialized with 4 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable x1 and variable y1 are initialized with 4 and 4 respectively.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the values of x1 and y1 are equal.
If they are not equal, it checks if x1 is less than y1. If it is, it subtracts x1 from y1.
If it is not, it subtracts y1 from x1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x + y + 1 - x1 as output, which is 10.
