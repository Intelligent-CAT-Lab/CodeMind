e variable x and variable y are initialized with 4 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable x1 and variable y1 are initialized with 4 and 4 respectively.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the values of x1 and y1 are equal.
If they are not equal, it checks if x1 is less than y1. If it is, it subtracts x1 from y1.
If it is not, it subtracts y1 from x1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x + y + 1 - x1 as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = sc.nextInt();
        int y = sc.nextInt();
        int x1 = x;
        int y1 = y;
        while (x1!= y1){
            if(x1 < y1)y1 -= x1;
            else x1 -= y1;
        }
        System.out.println(x + y + 1 - x1);



    }







}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
