he variable val is initialized with 12.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable val is less than or equal to the square of variable a.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the value of variable val is divisible by variable a. If it is, it prints the value of variable a and divides the value of variable val by variable a.
If the value of variable val is not divisible by variable a, it increments the value of variable a by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable val as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
public class Main{
     public static void main(String[] args){
          int i,j;
   
          int val = new java.util.Scanner(System.in).nextInt();
  
          int a=2;
          System.out.print(val + ":");
   
          while(val>=a*a){
                if(val%a==0){
                      System.out.print(" " + a);
                    val/=a;
                 }else{
                     a++;
                }
  
         }
          System.out.println(" " +  val);
     }
 }
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```13
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable val is initialized with 13.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable val is less than or equal to the square of variable a.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the value of variable val is divisible by variable a. If it is, it prints the value of variable a and divides the value of variable val by variable a.
If the value of variable val is not divisible by variable a, it increments the value of variable a by 1.
