he variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input.
The function culc(n) is called with argument n.
The function checks if n is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it returns 0.
If n is greater than 2, it returns the sum of the values of the function culc(n-i) for i from 3 to n-3.
The function culc(n-i) is called with argument n-i.
The function checks if n-i is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it returns 0.
If n-i is greater than 2, it returns the sum of the values of the function culc(n-i) for i from 3 to n-3.
The function culc(n-i) is called with argument n-i.
The function checks if n-i is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it returns 0.
If n-i is greater than 2, it returns the sum of the values of the function culc(n-i) for i from 3 to n-3.
The function culc(n-i) is called with argument n-i.
The function checks if n-i is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it returns 0.
If n-i is greater than 2, it returns the sum of the values of the function culc(n-i) for i from 3 to n-3.
The function culc(n-i) is called with argument n-i.
The function checks if n-i is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it returns 0.
If n-i is greater than 2, it returns the sum of the values of the function culc(n-i) for i from 3 to n-3.
The function culc(n-i) is called with argument n-i.
The function checks if n-i is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it returns 0.
If n-i is greater than 2, it returns the sum of the values of the function culc(n-i) for i from 3 to n-3.
