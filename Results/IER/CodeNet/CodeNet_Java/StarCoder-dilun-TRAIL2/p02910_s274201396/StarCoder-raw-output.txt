he variable S is initialized with the input string.
The variable li is initialized with the string S splitted into an array of characters.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the array li. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is even or odd. If i is even, it checks if the character at index i of the array li is equal to "R", "U" or "D". If it is not, it increments the value of variable count by 1 and breaks out of the loop.
If i is odd, it checks if the character at index i of the array li is equal to "L", "U" or "D". If it is not, it increments the value of variable count by 1 and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable count is 0. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    String S = sc.next();
    String li[] = S.split("");
    int count = 0;
    
    for(int i=0;i<li.length;i++){
      if(i%2==0){
        if (li[i].equals("R") || li[i].equals("U") || li[i].equals("D")){
        }else{
          count++;
          break;
        }
      }else{
        if(li[i].equals("L") || li[i].equals("U") || li[i].equals("D")){
        }else{
          count++;
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    if(count == 0){
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }else{
      System.out.println("No");
    }
  }
}
