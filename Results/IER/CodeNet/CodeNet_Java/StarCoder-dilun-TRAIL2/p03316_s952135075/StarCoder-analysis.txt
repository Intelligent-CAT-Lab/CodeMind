he variable n is initialized with 12.
The variable c is initialized with the value of variable n.
The variable s is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger n by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable s.
Then it checks if the calculated variable s is divisible by variable c. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
If it is not, it prints "No" as output.
