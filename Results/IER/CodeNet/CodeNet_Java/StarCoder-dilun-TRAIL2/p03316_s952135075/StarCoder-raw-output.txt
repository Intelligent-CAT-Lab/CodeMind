he variable n is initialized with 12.
The variable c is initialized with the value of variable n.
The variable s is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger n by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable s.
Then it checks if the calculated variable s is divisible by variable c. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
If it is not, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    long n = sc.nextLong();
    long c= n;
    long s = 0;
    for(int i =0;i<11;i++){
      if(n==0){
        break;
      }
      s=s+n%10;
      n=(n-n%10)/10;

    }
    if(c%s==0){
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }else{
      System.out.println("No");
    }
  }
  

  
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```123
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 123.
The variable c is initialized with the value of variable n.
The variable s is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable n.

Then it checks if the calculated variable s is div
