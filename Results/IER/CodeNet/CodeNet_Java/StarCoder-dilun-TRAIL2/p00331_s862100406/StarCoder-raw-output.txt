he variable H is initialized with -3 and variable R is initialized with 3.
The code checks if H*(-1) is equal to R. If it is, it prints 0.
If it is not, it checks if H*(-1) is greater than R. If it is, it prints -1.
If it is not, it checks if H*(-1) is less than R. If it is, it prints 1.
<<<Output>>>
-1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
    void solve(){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr2 = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) arr2[i] = arr[i];
        Arrays.sort(arr2);
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == arr2[i]) count++;
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){ new Main().solve(); }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5.
An array of size 5 is created and initialized with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively.
An array of size 5 is created and initialized with the values of array arr.
The values of array arr are sorted in ascending order and stored in array arr2.
The code counts the number of times each element of array arr is equal to the corresponding element of array arr2.
The number of times each element of array arr is equal to the corresponding element of array arr2 is stored in variable count.
The code prints the value of variable count
