variable N is initialized with 15.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is divisible by 3 and 5. If it is not, it adds the current interger i to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 1,2,4,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14 and 15.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 30.
