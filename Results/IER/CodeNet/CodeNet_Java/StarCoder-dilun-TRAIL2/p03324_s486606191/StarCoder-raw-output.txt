he variable D is initialized with 0 and variable N is initialized with 5.
The variable num is initialized with 100 to the power of D.
Then it checks if N is equal to 100. If it is, it increments N by 1.
Then it calculates the final value of variable ans by multiplying variable num with N.
If D is equal to 0, it prints the value of N.
Otherwise, it prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

//    	File file = new File("test.txt");
//    	Scanner sc = new Scanner(file);
    	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    	int N = sc.nextInt();
    	int M = sc.nextInt();
    	int ans = 0;
    	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    		int num = sc.nextInt();
    		if (num % M == 0) ans++;
    	}
    	System.out.println(ans);
    	sc.close();
    }

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 and variable M is initialized with 3.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger num is divisible by M. If it is, it increments variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
