he variable D is initialized with 0 and variable N is initialized with 5.
The variable num is initialized with 100 to the power of D.
Then it checks if N is equal to 100. If it is, it increments N by 1.
Then it calculates the final value of variable ans by multiplying variable num with N.
If D is equal to 0, it prints the value of N.
Otherwise, it prints the value of ans.
