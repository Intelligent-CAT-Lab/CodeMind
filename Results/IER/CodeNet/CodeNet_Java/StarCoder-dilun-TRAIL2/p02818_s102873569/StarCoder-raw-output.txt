he variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 3.
The code checks if a is positive and k is positive. If it is, it subtracts k from a. If k is greater than a, it subtracts a from k.
Then it checks if b is positive and k is positive. If it is, it subtracts k from b. If k is greater than b, it subtracts b from k.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable a and variable b as output, which is 0 0.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String line1 = sc.nextLine();
        String[] array = line1.split(" ");
        
        long a = Long.parseLong(array[0]);
        long b = Long.parseLong(array[1]);
        long k = Long.parseLong(array[2]);
        
        if(a > 0 && k > 0)
        {
            if(k >= a)
            {
                k -= a;
                a = 0;
            }
            else
            {
                a -= k;
                k = 0;
            }
        }
        if(b > 0 && k > 0)
        {
            if(k >= b)
            {
                k -= b;
                b = 0;
            }
            else
            {
                b -= k;
                k = 0;
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(a + " " + b);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 3.
The code checks if a is positive and k is positive. If it is, it subtracts k from a. If k is
