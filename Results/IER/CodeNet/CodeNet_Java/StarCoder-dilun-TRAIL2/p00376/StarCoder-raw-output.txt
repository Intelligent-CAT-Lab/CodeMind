he variable a and variable b are initialized with 20 and 30 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It calculates the absolute value of the difference between variable a and variable b and stores it in variable ans.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int ans=0;

        int a=sc.nextInt();
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        
        ans=a+b;

        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 30
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 20 and 30 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It calculates the sum of the values of variable a and variable b and stores it in variable ans.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
