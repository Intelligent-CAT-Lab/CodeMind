e variable S is initialized with the input string. The variable len is initialized with the length of the string S. The variable count is initialized with the number of characters in the string S that are equal to 'x'.
The code checks if the sum of 8, 15 - len and len - count is less than or equal to 8. If it is, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
