he variable A is initialized with 6 and variable B is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It checks if the sum of A and B is greater than or equal to 10. If it is, it prints the string "error" as output.
If the sum of A and B is less than 10, it prints the sum of A and B as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int A = sc.nextInt();
		int B = sc.nextInt();
		int C = sc.nextInt();
		
		if(A+B+C >= 10)
			System.out.println("error");
		else
			System.out.println(A+B+C);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
