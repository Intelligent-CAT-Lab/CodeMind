he variable a is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It checks if a is even or odd. If it is even, it divides a by 2 and subtracts 1 from the result. If it is odd, it divides a by 2.
After the if statement, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[]args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		if(a % 2 == 0) {
			int ans = a / 2;
			ans = ans - 1;
			System.out.println(ans);
		}else {
			int ans = a / 2;
			System.out.println(ans);
		}
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It checks if a is even or odd. If it is even, it divides a by 2 and subtracts 1 from the result. If it is odd, it divides a by 2.
After the if statement, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
