he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable i.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the product of i and j is less than n. If it is, it adds 1 to variable cnt. The condition is met when i is 1,2 and 3 and j is 1,2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int cnt = 0;
		for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
			for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
				if (i * j < n) {
					cnt++;
				} else {
					break;
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println(cnt);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
