he variable n is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable i.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the product of i and j is less than n. If it is, it adds 1 to variable cnt. The condition is met when i is 1,2 and 3 and j is 1,2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 9.
