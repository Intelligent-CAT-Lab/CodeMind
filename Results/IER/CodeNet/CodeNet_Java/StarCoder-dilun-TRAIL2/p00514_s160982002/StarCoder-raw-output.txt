he variable N is initialized with 2, variable M is initialized with 0 and variable R is initialized with 3.
The value of variable R is subtracted from N * M to get the value of R.
If the value of R is less than 0, then the value of variable R is set to 0.
The value of variable ans is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans by multiplying it with the value of R + N - 1 - i and dividing it by the value of i + 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int M = sc.nextInt();
		int R = sc.nextInt();
		int ans = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
			for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
				if (i + j == R) {
					ans++;
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
