he variable N is initialized with 2, variable M is initialized with 0 and variable R is initialized with 3.
The value of variable R is subtracted from N * M to get the value of R.
If the value of R is less than 0, then the value of variable R is set to 0.
The value of variable ans is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans by multiplying it with the value of R + N - 1 - i and dividing it by the value of i + 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
