he variable a and variable b are initialized with 20 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
The value of variable a is multiplied by the value of variable b and the result is stored in variable sum.
The final value of variable sum is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a,b,c,sum;
		a = scan.nextInt();
		b = scan.nextInt();
		c = scan.nextInt();
		
		sum = a * b * c;
		
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
