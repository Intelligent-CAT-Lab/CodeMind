ble S is initialized with a char array of size 500000.
The variable n is initialized with the length of the input.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The variable c is initialized with the first character of the input.
The variable up is initialized with 0.
The variable down is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is '<'. If it is, it checks if the current character c is the same as the previous character c. If it is, it increments the value of variable up by 1. Otherwise, it adds the maximum of variable up and variable down to variable ans, and then resets the values of variable up and variable down to 1 and 0 respectively.
Otherwise, it increments the value of variable down by 1.
After the loop finishes, it adds the maximum of variable up and variable down to variable ans, and then resets the values of variable up and variable down to 1 and 0 respectively.
Finally, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
