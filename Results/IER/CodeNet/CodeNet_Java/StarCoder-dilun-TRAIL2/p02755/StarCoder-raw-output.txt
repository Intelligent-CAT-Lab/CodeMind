he variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 99999999 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the monthly interest rate of the current interger i by multiplying it with 0.08. Then it calculates the monthly payment of the current interger i by multiplying it with 0.10.
Then it checks if the calculated monthly interest rate and monthly payment are equal to the input A and B. If it does, it prints the current interger i as output.
After the loop finishes, it prints -1 as output, which is the correct answer.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Main().run();
    }

    private void run() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int M = scanner.nextInt();

        int[] arr = new int[N];
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            arr[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }

        int[] arr2 = new int[M];
        for(int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            arr2[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }

        int[] arr3 = new int[N + M];
        for(int i = 0; i < N + M; i++) {
            arr3[i] = 0;
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
                arr3[i + j] += arr[i] * arr2[j];
            }
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < N + M; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr3[i] + " ");
        }
    }
}

</Code>
