he variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 99999999 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the monthly interest rate of the current interger i by multiplying it with 0.08. Then it calculates the monthly payment of the current interger i by multiplying it with 0.10.
Then it checks if the calculated monthly interest rate and monthly payment are equal to the input A and B. If it does, it prints the current interger i as output.
After the loop finishes, it prints -1 as output, which is the correct answer.
