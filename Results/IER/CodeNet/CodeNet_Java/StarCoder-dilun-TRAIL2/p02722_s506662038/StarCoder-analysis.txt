e variable j is initialized with 6.
The variable k is initialized with j - 1, which is 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if j is divisible by i. If it is, it calls the function f with parameters i, j and l.
The function f first divides j by i and stores the result in variable k. Then it checks if k is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i to the set l.
After the loop finishes, it checks if j is less than or equal to 3. If it is, it prints j - 1 as output.
Otherwise, it prints the size of the set l + 2 as output.
