NO-ANSWER
variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The function solve() is called to calculate the output.
Inside the function, it creates a 100x100 boolean array ans to store the output.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 50 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable h.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable w.
Inside the second for loop, it sets the value of ans[h][w] to true.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to aq-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable h.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 50 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable w.
Inside the third for loop, it sets the value of ans[h][w] to false.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to ar-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable h.
Inside the third for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 50 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable w.
Inside the fourth for loop, it sets the value of ans[h][w] to false.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to bq-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable h.
Inside the fourth for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 50 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable w.
Inside the fifth for loop, it sets the value of ans[h][w] to true.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to br-1 to check each integer i in this range. The
