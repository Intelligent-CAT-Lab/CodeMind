he variable A, B and C are initialized with 3, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The array arr is initialized with the values of A, B and C.
The array arr is sorted in ascending order.
The condition is met when A, B and C are all odd.
The result is calculated by multiplying the first two elements of the sorted array arr.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args ){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    long A = sc.nextLong();
    long B = sc.nextLong();
    long C = sc.nextLong();

    long [] arr = new long[]{ A,B,C };
    Arrays.sort(arr);

    long result = 0 ;
    if (A % 2 == 0 && B % 2 == 0 && C % 2 == 0 ) {
      result = arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[2];
    }
    System.out.println(result);
  }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
