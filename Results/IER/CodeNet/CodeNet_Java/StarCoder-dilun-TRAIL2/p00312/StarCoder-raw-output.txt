he variable i1 and variable i2 are initialized with 10 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
The code divides i1 by i2 and stores the quotient in variable count.
The code adds the remainder of i1 divided by i2 to variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        try {
            String str1 = reader.readLine();
	    String s[]=str1.split(" ");
	    int i1=Integer.parseInt(s[0]);
	    int i2=Integer.parseInt(s[1]);

	    int count=i1/i2;
	    count+=i1%i2;
	    System.out.println(count);
            reader.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable i1 and variable i2 are initialized with 10 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
The code divides i1 by i2 and stores the quotient in variable count.
The code adds the remainder of i1 divided by i2 to variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
