code first replaces all the dots with commas and then replaces all the commas with spaces.
Then it splits the input string into tokens by using the space character as the delimiter.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the tokens array.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the length of the current token by using the length() method.
Then it checks if the length of the current token is between 3 and 6. If it is, it prints the first 3 or 6 characters of the current token.
If the current token is longer than 6 characters, it prints the first 6 characters of the current token.
If the current token is shorter than 3 characters, it prints the whole token.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
