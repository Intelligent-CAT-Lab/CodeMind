he variable N is initialized with 15.
It creates an array a of size N and initializes it with values from 1 to N-1.
It creates an array b of size N and initializes it with values from N-1 to 1.
It creates an array c of size N and initializes it with values from 1 to N-1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to N-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a[i] and b[i].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a[i] and b[i] by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable c[i].
After the loop finishes, it sorts the array c in ascending order.
Finally, it prints the first element of the array c as output, which is 10.
