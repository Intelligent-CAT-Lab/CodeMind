he variable str is initialized with the input.
Then it creates a StringTokenizer object with the input string and a space as the delimiter.
Then it creates two integer variables yoko and tate and initializes them with the first and second tokens of the StringTokenizer object.
Then it creates a String array hata with tate elements.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to tate-1 to initialize each element of the array hata with an empty string.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to yoko-1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is 0 or i is yoko-1. If it is, it adds a plus sign to the first and last elements of the array hata.
If it is not, it adds a dash sign to the first and last elements of the array hata.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to tate-1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if j is not equal to (tate-1)/2. If it is, it adds a dot sign to the jth element of the array hata.
If it is equal to (tate-1)/2, it checks if i is equal to (yoko-1)/2. If it is, it adds the input string to the jth element of the array hata.
If it is not, it adds a dot sign to the jth element of the array hata.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to tate-1 to print each element of the array hata.
