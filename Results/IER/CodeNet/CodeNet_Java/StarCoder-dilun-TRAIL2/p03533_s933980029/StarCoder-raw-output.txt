he variable S is initialized with the input string "KIHBR".
The variable sb is initialized with the value of variable S.
The variable ch is initialized with the value of variable S.
The variable akb is initialized with the value of string "AKIHABARA".
The for loop iterates from 0 to 9.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the length of variable sb is greater than or equal to i.
If it is, it checks if the character at index i of variable akb is equal to the character at index i of variable sb.
If it is, it continues the loop.
If it is not, it inserts a character "A" at index i of variable sb.
Then it checks if the character at index i of variable akb is equal to the character at index i of variable sb.
If it is, it continues the loop.
If it is not, it prints "NO" as output and exits the program.
After the loop finishes, it prints "YES" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES
