he variable membersCount is initialized with 4, variable trainFee is initialized with 2 and variable taxiFee is initialized with 9.
The variable result is initialized with 0.
The if statement checks if the product of membersCount and trainFee is greater than or equal to taxiFee. If it is, the variable result is set to taxiFee.
Otherwise, the variable result is set to the product of membersCount and trainFee.
After the if statement, it prints the final value of variable result as output, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max = arr[0];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
			if(arr[i]>max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
The array arr is initialized with 5 elements.
The variable max is initialized with the first element of the array arr.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger arr[i] is greater than the variable max. If it is, the variable max is set to arr[i].
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable max as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
