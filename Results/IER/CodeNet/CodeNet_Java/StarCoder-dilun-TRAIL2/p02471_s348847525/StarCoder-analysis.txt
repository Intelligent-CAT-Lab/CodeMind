variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 12 respectively according to the input.
The function egcd is called with the values of a and b as parameters.
The function egcd calculates the greatest common divisor of a and b.
The function egcd returns an array of two integers, which are the greatest common divisor of a and b and the coefficient of a in the linear combination of a and b which is also the greatest common divisor of a and b.
The function egcd returns the array {1, -1} as output.
The first element of the array is the greatest common divisor of a and b, which is 4.
The second element of the array is the coefficient of a in the linear combination of a and b, which is -1.
The function egcd prints the first element of the array as the greatest common divisor of a and b, which is 4.
The function egcd prints the second element of the array as the coefficient of a in the linear combination of a and b, which is -1.
