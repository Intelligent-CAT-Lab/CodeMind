 variable S is initialized with the string "abaababaab".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the last index of the string to the first index of the string. The index of the string is also passed to variable i.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the string is evenly divisible by 2. The condition is met when i is 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable i as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    int N = scanner.nextInt();
    int[] A = new int[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      A[i] = scanner.nextInt();
    }

    int[] B = new int[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      B[i] = scanner.nextInt();
    }

    int[] C = new int[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      System.out.println(C[i]);
    }
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1

```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3.
The variable A is initialized with an array of length 3.
The variable B is initialized with an array of length 3.
The variable C is initialized with an array of length 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of
