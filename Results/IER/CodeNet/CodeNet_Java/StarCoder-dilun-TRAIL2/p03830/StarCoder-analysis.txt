he variable N is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it iterates while temp is divisible by j. The value of variable j is also passed to the while loop.
Inside the while loop, it divides temp by j and increments the value of cnt[j] by 1.
Then it checks if temp is greater than 1. If it is, it increments the value of cnt[temp] by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it multiplies ans by (cnt[i]+1) and stores the result in ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
