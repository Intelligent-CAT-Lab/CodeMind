he variable N is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it iterates while temp is divisible by j. The value of variable j is also passed to the while loop.
Inside the while loop, it divides temp by j and increments the value of cnt[j] by 1.
Then it checks if temp is greater than 1. If it is, it increments the value of cnt[temp] by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it multiplies ans by (cnt[i]+1) and stores the result in ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[N];
		for(int i=0; i<N; i++)
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		
		int[] dp = new int[N];
		dp[0] = arr[0];
		dp[1] = Math.max(arr[0], arr[1]);
		for(int i=2; i<N; i++)
			dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]+arr[i]);
		
		System.out.println(dp[N-1]);
		sc.close();
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output
