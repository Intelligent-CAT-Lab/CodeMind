he variable N is initialized with 4, variable K is initialized with 2 and variable S is initialized with 3.
The if statement checks if variable K is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if variable S is equal to 1000000000. If it is, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to print the value of 1.
If the if statement is not met, it checks if variable S is equal to 1000000000. If it is, it adds 1 to variable S.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to print the value of variable S.
If the if statement is not met, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to print the value of variable S.
If the current interger i is less than variable K, it prints the value of variable S.
If the current interger i is greater than or equal to variable K, it checks if variable S is equal to 1000000000. If it is, it prints the value of 1.
If the if statement is not met, it prints the value of variable S plus 1.
