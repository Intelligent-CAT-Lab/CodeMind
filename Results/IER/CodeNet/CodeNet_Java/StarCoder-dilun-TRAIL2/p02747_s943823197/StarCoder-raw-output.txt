he variable str is initialized with the input.
It replaces all the occurrences of the string "hi" with an empty string.
It checks if the length of the string after replacement is 0. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class Main{
  public static void main(String args[]){ 
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    String str = scan.next();
   
    String last = str.replaceAll("hi", "");
    if(last.length() == 0) {
      System.out.println("Yes");
    } else {
      System.out.println("No");
    }
   }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```hi
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
