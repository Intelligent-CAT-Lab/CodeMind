e variable N is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9 to check each integer A in this range. The value of variable A is also passed to variable N.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger N is divisible by A and the quotient is less than 10. If it does, it sets the boolean variable f to true.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable f as output, which is true.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int sum = 0;
		for(int i = 1 ; i <= N ; ++i){
			sum += i;
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable N.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 55.
<<<Output>>>
55
