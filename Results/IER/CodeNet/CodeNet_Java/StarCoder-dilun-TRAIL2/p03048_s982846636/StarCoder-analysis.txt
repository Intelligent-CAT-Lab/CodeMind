NO-ANSWER
he variable r, g, b and n are initialized with 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to (n / r + 1) to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to (n - (i * r)) / g + 1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if (n - (i * r + j * g)) % b == 0. If it does, it adds 1 to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111
