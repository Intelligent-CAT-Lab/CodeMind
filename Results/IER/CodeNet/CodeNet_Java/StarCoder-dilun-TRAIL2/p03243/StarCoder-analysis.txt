he variable n is initialized with 111.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from n to 1000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by 111. If it is, it prints the current interger i as output and returns.
After the loop finishes, it does not print any output.
