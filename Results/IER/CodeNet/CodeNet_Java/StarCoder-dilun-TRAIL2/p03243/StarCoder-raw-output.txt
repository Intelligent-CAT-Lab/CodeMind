he variable n is initialized with 111.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from n to 1000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by 111. If it is, it prints the current interger i as output and returns.
After the loop finishes, it does not print any output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        for (int i = n; i < 1000; i++) {
            if (i % 111 == 0) {
                System.out.println(i);
                return;
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Not Found");
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```111
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
