he variable sides is initialized with an array of 4 integers. The first 2 integers are initialized with 1 and the last 2 integers are initialized with 3 and 4 respectively.
The variable total is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sides[i].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the values of the current interger sides[i] and adds it to variable total.
Then it checks if the calculated variable total is equal to the sum of the values of the 4 integers in the array sides. If it is, it prints "yes" as output.
Otherwise, it prints "no" as output.
