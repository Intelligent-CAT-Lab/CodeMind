he variable N is initialized with 11.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable N is greater than or equal to 10. If it is, it adds 9 to variable ans.
If the value of variable N is less than 10, it adds the value of variable N to variable ans.
Then it checks if the value of variable N is greater than or equal to 1000. If it is, it adds 900 to variable ans.
If the value of variable N is greater than or equal to 100 but less than 1000, it subtracts 100 from the value of variable N and adds the result to variable ans.
Then it checks if the value of variable N is greater than or equal to 100000. If it is, it adds 90000 to variable ans.
If the value of variable N is greater than or equal to 10000 but less than 100000, it subtracts 10000 from the value of variable N and adds the result to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 110000.
