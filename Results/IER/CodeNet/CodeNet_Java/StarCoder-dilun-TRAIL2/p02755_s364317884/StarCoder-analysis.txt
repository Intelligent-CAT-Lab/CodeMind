he variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from tax8pricemin to tax8pricemax to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tax8 and tax10.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the tax8 and tax10 of the current interger i by multiplying i with 0.08 and 0.1 respectively.
Then it checks if the calculated variable tax8 and tax10 are equal to the input values a and b. If it does, it prints the current interger i as output, which is 1.
If the for loop finishes without printing the output, it prints -1 as output.
