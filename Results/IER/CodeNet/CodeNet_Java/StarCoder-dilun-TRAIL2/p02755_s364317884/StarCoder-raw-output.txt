he variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from tax8pricemin to tax8pricemax to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tax8 and tax10.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the tax8 and tax10 of the current interger i by multiplying i with 0.08 and 0.1 respectively.
Then it checks if the calculated variable tax8 and tax10 are equal to the input values a and b. If it does, it prints the current interger i as output, which is 1.
If the for loop finishes without printing the output, it prints -1 as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        int tax8pricemin = (int)(((double)a) / 0.08);
        int tax8pricemax = (int)(((double)a + 1) / 0.08);

        for(int i = tax8pricemin ; i < tax8pricemax; i++){
            int tax8 = (int)(i * 0.08);
            int tax10 = (int)(i * 0.1);

            if(tax8 == a && tax10 == b){
                System.out.println(i);
                System.exit(0);
            }
        }
        System.out.println(-1);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from tax8pricemin to tax8pricemax to check each
