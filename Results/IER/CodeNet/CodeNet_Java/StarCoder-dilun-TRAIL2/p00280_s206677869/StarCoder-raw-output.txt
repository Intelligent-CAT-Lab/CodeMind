variable j and variable y are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The function play is called with the initial values of variables _j, _y, r, j and y.
Inside the function, it checks if the values of variables _j and _y are equal to the values of variables j and y. If they are, it prints the value of variable r.
Then it checks if the values of variables _j and _y are greater than the values of variables j and y. If they are, it returns.
Then it checks if the values of variables _j and _y are greater than or equal to 5 and the values of variables _y and y are less than or equal to 4. If they are, it returns.
Then it checks if the values of variables _j and _y are less than or equal to 4 and the values of variables _j and j are greater than or equal to 5. If they are, it returns.
Then it calls the function play again with the values of variables _j + 1, _y, r + "A", j, y.
Then it calls the function play again with the values of variables _j, _y + 1, r + "B", j, y.
After the function returns, it returns.
