he variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 2, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable bottleCapacity is initialized with a*a*b, which is 4.
The if statement checks if x*2 < bottleCapacity. If it is true, it solves a*b*b/2tan8 == x.
The else statement checks if x*2 >= bottleCapacity. If it is true, it solves a*a*a*tan8/2 = cap-x.
