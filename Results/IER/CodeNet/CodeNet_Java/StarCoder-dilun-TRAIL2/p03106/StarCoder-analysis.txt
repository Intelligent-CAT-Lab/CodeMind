he variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized with 8, 12 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 1 to 8 to check each integer z in this range. The value of variable z is also passed to variable A and variable B.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current interger z divides both A and B. If it does, it adds the current interger z to the array s. The condition is met when z is 1,2,4,8.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of the Kth element of the array s as output, which is 4.
