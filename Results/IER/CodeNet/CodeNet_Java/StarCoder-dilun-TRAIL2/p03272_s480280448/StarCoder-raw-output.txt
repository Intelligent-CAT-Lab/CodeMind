he variable N is initialized with 4 and variable i is initialized with 2.
The code subtracts i from N and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
2
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int i = sc.nextInt();
		sc.close();
		
		System.out.println(N-i+1);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
