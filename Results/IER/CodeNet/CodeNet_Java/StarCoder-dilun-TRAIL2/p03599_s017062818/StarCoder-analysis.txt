he variable A, B, C, D, E and F are initialized with 1, 2, 10, 20, 15 and 200 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to F/(A*100) to check each integer a in this range. The value of variable a is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to (F-100 * A * a)/(100 * B) to check each integer b in this range. The value of variable b is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to (F - 100 * A * a - 100 * B * b)/(C) to check each integer c in this range. The value of variable c is also passed to variable d.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to (F - 100 * A * a - 100 * B * b - C * c)/D to check each integer d in this range. The value of variable d is also passed to variable buf.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the calculated variable buf is greater than the variable ans. If it is, it updates the value of variable ans with the calculated variable buf, and it updates the value of variable water with the product of A*a+B*b, and it updates the value of variable sugar with the calculated variable buf.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable water and variable sugar as output, which is 200 200.
