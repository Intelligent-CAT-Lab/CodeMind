e variable a and variable b are initialized with 5 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable ans by subtracting 1 from variable a.
Then it checks if the calculated variable ans is less than or equal to variable b. If it is, it adds 1 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	InputStream in = System.in;
	PrintStream out = System.out;

	public void _main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(in);

		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		sc.close();

		int ans = a - 1;
		ans += a <= b? 1 : 0;

		out.println(ans);

	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Main()._main(args);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
