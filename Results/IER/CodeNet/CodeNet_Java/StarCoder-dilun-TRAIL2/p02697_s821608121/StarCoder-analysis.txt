he variable n is initialized with 4 and variable m is initialized with 1.
The variable a is initialized with 1 and variable b is initialized with m.
The variable c is initialized with b.
The for loop iterates from 0 to m-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if a equals b. If it does, it increments variable a by 1 and decrements variable b by 1.
Then it prints the values of variables a and b.
The first iteration prints 1 4.
The second iteration prints 2 3.
The third iteration prints 3 2.
The fourth iteration prints 4 1.
