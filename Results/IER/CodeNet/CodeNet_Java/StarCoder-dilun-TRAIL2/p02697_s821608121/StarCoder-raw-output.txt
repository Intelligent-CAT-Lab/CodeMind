he variable n is initialized with 4 and variable m is initialized with 1.
The variable a is initialized with 1 and variable b is initialized with m.
The variable c is initialized with b.
The for loop iterates from 0 to m-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if a equals b. If it does, it increments variable a by 1 and decrements variable b by 1.
Then it prints the values of variables a and b.
The first iteration prints 1 4.
The second iteration prints 2 3.
The third iteration prints 3 2.
The fourth iteration prints 4 1.
<<<Output>>>
1 4
2 3
3 2
4 1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int a = 1;
		int b = 1;
		int c = 1;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
			System.out.println(a + " " + b + " " + c);
			a = a + b;
			b = b + c;
			c = a + b;
		}
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
The variable a is initialized with 1.
The variable b is initialized with 1.
The variable c is initialized with 1.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it prints the values of variables a, b and c.
The first iteration prints 1 1 1.
The second iteration prints 1 2 3.
The third iteration prints 1 3 6.
The fourth iteration prints 1 4 10.
The fifth iteration prints 1 5 1
