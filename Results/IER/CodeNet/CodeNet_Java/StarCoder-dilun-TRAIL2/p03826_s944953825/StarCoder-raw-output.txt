he variable a is initialized with 4 elements. The first 4 elements are initialized with the input values.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a[i].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the first 2 elements of the array a and the last 2 elements of the array a.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of the product of the first 2 elements of the array a and the last 2 elements of the array a as output, which is 35.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a[] = new int[4];
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++){
      a[i] = sc.nextInt();
    }
    System.out.println(Math.max(a[0]*a[1], a[2]*a[3]));
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 2 7
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
