he variable a is initialized with 4 elements. The first 4 elements are initialized with the input values.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a[i].
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the first 2 elements of the array a and the last 2 elements of the array a.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of the product of the first 2 elements of the array a and the last 2 elements of the array a as output, which is 35.
