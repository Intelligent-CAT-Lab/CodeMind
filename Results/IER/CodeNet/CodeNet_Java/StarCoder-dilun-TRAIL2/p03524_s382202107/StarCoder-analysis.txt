he variable cs is initialized with the input string "abac".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string cs. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cs[i].
Inside the for loop, it increments the value of the array count at the index of the current character cs[i] - 'a'.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the absolute difference between the values of count[0] and count[1] is less than or equal to 1 and the absolute difference between the values of count[0] and count[2] is less than or equal to 1 and the absolute difference between the values of count[1] and count[2] is less than or equal to 1.
If all the conditions are met, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
