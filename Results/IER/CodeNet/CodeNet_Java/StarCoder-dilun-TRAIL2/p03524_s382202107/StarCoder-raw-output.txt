he variable cs is initialized with the input string "abac".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string cs. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cs[i].
Inside the for loop, it increments the value of the array count at the index of the current character cs[i] - 'a'.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the absolute difference between the values of count[0] and count[1] is less than or equal to 1 and the absolute difference between the values of count[0] and count[2] is less than or equal to 1 and the absolute difference between the values of count[1] and count[2] is less than or equal to 1.
If all the conditions are met, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = in.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = in.nextInt();
		}
		int max = arr[0];
		int min = arr[0];
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			if (arr[i] > max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
			if (arr[i] < min) {
				min = arr[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max - min);
		in.close();
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to
