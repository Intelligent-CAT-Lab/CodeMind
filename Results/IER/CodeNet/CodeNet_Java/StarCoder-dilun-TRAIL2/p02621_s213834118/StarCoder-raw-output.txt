TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
    	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      	int a = sc.nextInt();
      	System.out.println(a+(a*a)+(a*a*a));
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
