he variable A is initialized with 3, variable B is initialized with 8 and variable K is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable A and checks if the sum of A and i is greater than B. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to 0 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it subtracts the current interger i from variable B and checks if the difference of B and i is less than A. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
