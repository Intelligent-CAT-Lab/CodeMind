he variable k is initialized with 2.
The variable A is initialized with 1.
The variable B is initialized with 3.
The variable n is initialized with 4.
The variable k1 is initialized with 0.
The variable a1 is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the bitwise AND of the bitwise XOR of A and B with the current interger i is greater than 0. If it is, it sets the bitwise OR of the current interger i with variable mask.
It also sets the variable removed to the value of variable removed plus 1.
It also sets the variable k1 to the value of variable i.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable a1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the bitwise AND of the bitwise XOR of A and B with the current interger j is greater than 0. If it is, it sets the bitwise OR of the current interger j with variable mask.
It also sets the variable removed to the value of variable removed plus 1.
It also sets the variable k1 to the value of variable j.
