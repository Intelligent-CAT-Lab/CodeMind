he variable s is initialized with the string "1222" according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates over each character c in the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is equal to '2'. If it is, it increments the value of variable rs by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable rs as output, which is 3.
