he variable A, B, C, D, E and F are initialized with 1, 2, 10, 20, 15 and 200 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to F / (A * 100) to check each integer a in this range. The value of variable a is also passed to variable ans1.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to F / (B * 100) to check each integer b in this range. The value of variable b is also passed to variable ans2.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to F / C to check each integer c in this range. The value of variable c is also passed to variable ans3.
Inside the third for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to F / D to check each integer d in this range. The value of variable d is also passed to variable ans4.
Inside the fourth for loop, it checks if the condition 100 * a * A + 100 * b * B + C * c + D * d <= F && (double)(C * c + D * d) / (double)(a * A * 100 + b * B * 100) <= (double)E / (double)100 is met.
If it is met, it checks if the condition (double)ans2 / (double)ans1 < (double)(C * c + D * d) / (double)(100 * a * A + 100 * b * B + C * c + D * d) is met.
If it is met, it updates the value of variable ans1 with the new value 100 * a * A + 100 * b * B + C * c + D * d and updates the value of variable ans2 with the new value C * c + D * d.
After the fourth for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans1 and ans2 as output, which is 100 100.
<<<Output>>>
100 100
