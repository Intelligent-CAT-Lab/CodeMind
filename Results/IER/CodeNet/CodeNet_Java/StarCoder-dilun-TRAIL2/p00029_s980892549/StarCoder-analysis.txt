he variable sentence is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the sentence array.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the sentence array.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current string in the sentence array is equal to the string in the sentence array at index j.
If it is, it increments the value of the cnt array at index j by 1.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the sentence array.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the value of the cnt array at index k is greater than the value of the max variable.
If it is, it updates the value of the max variable with the value of the cnt array at index k.
It also updates the value of the str1 variable with the string in the sentence array at index k.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the sentence array.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the length of the string in the sentence array at index l is greater than the value of the longest variable.
If it is, it updates the value of the longest variable with the length of the string in the sentence array at index l.
It also updates the value of the str2 variable with the string in the sentence array at index l.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints the values of the str1 and str2 variables as output, which is "you mail" and "lectures".
