variable X is initialized with the input string. The variable N is initialized with the length of the input string. The variable s is initialized with 0. The variable t is initialized with 0. The variable ans is initialized with the value of variable N.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to variable N-1 to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'S'. If it is, it increments variable s by 1.
Else, it checks if variable s is not equal to 0. If it is, it decrements variable ans by 2 and decrements variable s by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 4.
