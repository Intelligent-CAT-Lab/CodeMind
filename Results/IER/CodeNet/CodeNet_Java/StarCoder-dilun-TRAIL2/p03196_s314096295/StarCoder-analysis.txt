he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable P is initialized with 24.
The code enters a while loop and it checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of variable P and exits the program.
If n is not equal to 1, it calculates the square root of variable P and adds 1 to it. Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the calculated value of upper.
Inside the for loop, it checks if variable P is divisible by i. If it is, it enters a while loop and it counts the number of times variable P is divisible by i.
Then it divides variable P by i and it repeats this process until variable P becomes 1.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of variable ans by taking the power of i and the number of times variable P is divisible by i.
Then it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 12.
