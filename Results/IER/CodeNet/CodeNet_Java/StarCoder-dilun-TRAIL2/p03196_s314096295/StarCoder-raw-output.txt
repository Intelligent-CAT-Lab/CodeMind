he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable P is initialized with 24.
The code enters a while loop and it checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of variable P and exits the program.
If n is not equal to 1, it calculates the square root of variable P and adds 1 to it. Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the calculated value of upper.
Inside the for loop, it checks if variable P is divisible by i. If it is, it enters a while loop and it counts the number of times variable P is divisible by i.
Then it divides variable P by i and it repeats this process until variable P becomes 1.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of variable ans by taking the power of i and the number of times variable P is divisible by i.
Then it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;
 
import static java.lang.System.in;
 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long n = sc.nextLong();
        long P = sc.nextLong();
        if(n==1){
            System.out.println(P);
            System.exit(0);
        }
        long upper = (long) Math.sqrt(P)+1;
        long ans=1;
        for(long i=2;i<=upper&&i<=P;i++){
            if(P%i!=0) continue;
            long cnt=0;
            while(P%i==0){
                cnt++;
                P = P/i;
            }
            long now = cnt/n;
            ans*=(long) Math.pow(i,now);
        }
        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);
        out.println(ans);
        out.flush();
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 24
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
