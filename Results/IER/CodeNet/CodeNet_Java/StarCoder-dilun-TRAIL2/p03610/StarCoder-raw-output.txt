he variable s is initialized with the input string "atcoder".
The variable array is initialized with the string s splitted into an array of characters.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it prints the character at index j of the array array.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        String[] array = s.split("");

        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 2){
            System.out.print(array[i]);
        }
        
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```atcoder
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
