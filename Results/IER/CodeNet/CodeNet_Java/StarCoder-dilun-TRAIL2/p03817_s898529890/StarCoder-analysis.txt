he variable x is initialized with 7.
The variable rest is initialized with the remainder of x divided by 11.
The variable result is initialized with the quotient of x minus rest divided by 11.
The variable result is multiplied by 2.
If rest is greater than 0, it is incremented by 1.
If rest is greater than 6, it is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 10.
