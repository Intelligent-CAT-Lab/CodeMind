he variable x is initialized with 7.
The variable rest is initialized with the remainder of x divided by 11.
The variable result is initialized with the quotient of x minus rest divided by 11.
The variable result is multiplied by 2.
If rest is greater than 0, it is incremented by 1.
If rest is greater than 6, it is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x = scan.nextInt();
		int y = scan.nextInt();
		int z = scan.nextInt();
		int result = 0;
		if(x>y) {
			if(x>z) {
				result = x;
			} else {
				result = z;
			}
		} else {
			if(y>z) {
				result = y;
			} else {
				result = z;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(result);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 1.
The variable y is initialized with 2.
The variable z is initialized with 3.
The variable result is initialized with 0.
If x is greater than y, it checks if x is greater than z. If it is, it sets result to x. Otherwise, it sets result to z.
If x is not greater than y, it checks if y is greater than z. If it is, it sets result to y. Otherwise, it sets result to z.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
