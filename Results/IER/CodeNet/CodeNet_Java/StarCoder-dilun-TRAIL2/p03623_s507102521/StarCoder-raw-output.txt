e variable x, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 7 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the absolute difference between x and a and the absolute difference between x and b.
If the absolute difference between x and a is greater than the absolute difference between x and b, it prints 'B' as output.
Otherwise, it prints 'A' as output.
<<<Output>>>
A

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int x = sc.nextInt(), y = sc.nextInt();
		
		System.out.println(x + y);
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and variable y are initialized with 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It prints the sum of x and y as output.
<<<Output>>>
