he variable str1 and variable str2 are initialized with 9 and 12 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the sum of the two variables str1 and str2 and stores it in variable kei.
Then it checks if the calculated variable kei is less than 24. If it is, it prints the value of variable kei as output.
If it is not, it calculates the difference between variable kei and 24 and prints the value of the difference as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int str1 = sc.nextInt();
		int str2 = sc.nextInt();
		
		int kei = str1 + str2;
		if(kei < 24){
			System.out.println(kei); 
		}
		else{
			System.out.println(kei - 24); 
		}
		
	  }
	}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12 9
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
