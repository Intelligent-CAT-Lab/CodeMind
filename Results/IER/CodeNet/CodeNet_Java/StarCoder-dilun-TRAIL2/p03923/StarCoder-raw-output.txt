riable n, variable a are initialized with 8 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable dp is initialized with an array of size 2*n with all values set to Integer.MAX_VALUE>>3.
The variable ans is initialized with Integer.MAX_VALUE>>3.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from i to 2*n to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the minimum value of variable dp[j] by comparing the current value of dp[j] with dp[i] + a + j/i.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from n to 2*n to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the minimum value of variable ans by comparing the current value of ans with dp[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 17.
<<<Output>>>
17

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Main().run();
	}

	void run() {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int m = sc.nextInt();
		int[] a = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
			a[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		System.out.println(solver(n, m, a));
	}

	int solver(int n, int m, int[] a) {
		int ans = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
			int cur = a[i];
			int j = i + 1;
			while (j < n && cur < m) {
				cur += a[j];
				j++;
