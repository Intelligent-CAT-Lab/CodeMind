he variable N is initialized with "036" according to the input.
The variable l is initialized with the length of variable N.
The variable dp is initialized with a 2-dimensional array of size l+1 by 3.
The first row of variable dp is initialized with 1 in the first column and 0 in the second and third columns.
The second row of variable dp is initialized with 1 in the first column and 1 in the second and third columns.
The for loop iterates from 1 to l-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the minimum value of the previous row of variable dp in the first column, the previous row of variable dp in the second column and the previous row of variable dp in the third column.
Then it calculates the minimum value of the previous row of variable dp in the first column plus 9 minus the current interger c, the previous row of variable dp in the second column plus the current interger c, and the previous row of variable dp in the third column plus the current interger c plus 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of the minimum value of the previous row of variable dp in the first column, the minimum value of the previous row of variable dp in the second column and the minimum value of the previous row of variable dp in the third column as output, which is 1.
