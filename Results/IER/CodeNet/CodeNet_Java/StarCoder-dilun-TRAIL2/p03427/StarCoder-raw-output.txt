he variable N is initialized with 100.
The variable s is initialized with the string value of variable N.
The variable length is initialized with the length of variable s.
The variable c is initialized with the first digit of variable s.
The variable max is initialized with the value of (c - 1) + 9 * (length - 1).
The value of variable max is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            if (N % i == 0) {
                sum += i;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 100.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 100 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of variable N. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 217.
<<<Output>>>
217
