he variable n is initialized with 1.
It enters the if statement and checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it adds "a" to the list.
If n is not equal to 1, it enters the else statement and calls the function func(n-1) to get the list of strings.
Inside the for loop, it finds the maximum character in the string s and stores it in variable max.
Then it enters a for loop to iterate from 'a' to the maximum character + 1.
Inside the for loop, it adds the character c to the string s and stores it in variable newString.
After the loop finishes, it returns the list of strings.
