he variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is divisible by 9. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
If it is not, it prints "No" as output.
