he variable a, variable b, variable c and variable k are initialized with 2, 1, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable a is greater than or equal to variable k. If it is, it sets the value of variable answer to variable k.
Otherwise, it adds the value of variable a to variable answer. Then it subtracts the value of variable b from variable k.
Then it subtracts the value of variable k from variable answer.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long a = sc.nextLong();
		long b = sc.nextLong();
		long c = sc.nextLong();
		long k = sc.nextLong();
		long answer = 0;
		if(a>=k) {
			answer=k;
		}
		else {
			answer+=a;
			k=k-a;
			k=k-b;
			answer-=(k*1);
		}
		System.out.println(answer);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1 1 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable k are initialized with 2, 1, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable a is greater than or equal to variable k. If it is, it sets the value of variable answer to variable k.
Otherwise, it adds the value of variable a to variable answer. Then it subtracts the value of variable b from variable k.
Then it subtracts the value of variable k from variable answer.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is
