he variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2.
It checks if k is greater than or equal to n - 1. If it is, it prints the result of choose(2 * n - 1, n -1) which is 10.
Otherwise, it initializes an array nFactorial with 3 elements and fills it with values.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to k to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
