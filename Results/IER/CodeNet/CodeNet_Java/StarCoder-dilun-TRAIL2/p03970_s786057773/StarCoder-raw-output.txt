he variable s is initialized with the input string.
The variable m is initialized with the string "CODEFESTIVAL2016".
The variable k is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 15 to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character i of the string s is equal to the current character i of the string m. If it is not, it increments variable k by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable k as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
	Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
	String s = scan.next();
	int k = 0;
	for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
	    if(s.charAt(i)=='a' || s.charAt(i)=='e' || s.charAt(i)=='i' || s.charAt(i)=='o' || s.charAt(i)=='u')
		k++;
	}
	System.out.println(k);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```Codefestival```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string.
The variable k is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character i of the string s is equal to 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' or 'u'. If it is, it increments variable k by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable k as output, which is 2.
