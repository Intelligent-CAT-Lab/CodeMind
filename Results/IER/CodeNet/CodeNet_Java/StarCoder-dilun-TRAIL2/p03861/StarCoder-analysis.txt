he variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 4, 8 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
It calculates the number of times the division of variable b by variable x is greater than the division of variable a by variable x.
If the remainder of the division of variable a by variable x is 0, it adds 1 to variable count.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 3.
