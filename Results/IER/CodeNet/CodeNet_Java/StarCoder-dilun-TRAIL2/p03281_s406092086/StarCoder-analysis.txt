e variable n is initialized with 105.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 105 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is odd. If it is, it calculates the number of divisors of i.
Then it checks if the calculated number of divisors is 8. If it is, it adds 1 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
