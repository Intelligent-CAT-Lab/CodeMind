NO-ANSWER
he variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 5, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the product of A and B is less than N or if N is less than the sum of A and B minus 1.
If the condition is met, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to A to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters a while loop and it decrements variable B until the condition is met.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from variable n to variable n plus B to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it appends the value of j to the string builder sb.
After the loop finishes, it deletes the last character of the string builder sb.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the final value of the string builder sb as output, which is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 1
