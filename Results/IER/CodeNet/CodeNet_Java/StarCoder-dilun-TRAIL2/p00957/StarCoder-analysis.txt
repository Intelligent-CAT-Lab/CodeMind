e variable l and variable k are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable dp is initialized with 2 rows and l+1 columns. The first row is initialized with 1 and the second row is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to l to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the values of the current interger i and the previous interger j-1 in the first row of variable dp.
Then it calculates the sum of the values of the current interger i and the previous interger j-1 in the second row of variable dp.
Then it calculates the sum of the values of the current interger i and the previous interger j-k in the second row of variable dp.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
