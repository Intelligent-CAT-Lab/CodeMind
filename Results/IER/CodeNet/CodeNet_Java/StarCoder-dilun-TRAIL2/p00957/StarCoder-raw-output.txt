e variable l and variable k are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable dp is initialized with 2 rows and l+1 columns. The first row is initialized with 1 and the second row is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to l to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the values of the current interger i and the previous interger j-1 in the first row of variable dp.
Then it calculates the sum of the values of the current interger i and the previous interger j-1 in the second row of variable dp.
Then it calculates the sum of the values of the current interger i and the previous interger j-k in the second row of variable dp.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyScanner sc = new MyScanner();
        out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedOutputStream(System.out));
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        int m=sc.nextInt();
        int[]a=new int[n];
        int[]b=new int[m];
        for(int i=0;i<n;++i)
            a[i]=sc.nextInt();
        for(int i=0;i<m;++i)
            b[i]=sc.nextInt();
        int[]c=new int[n+m];
        for(int i=0;i<n;++i)
            c[i]=a[i];
        for(int i=0;i<m;++i)
            c[n+i]=b[i];
        Arrays.sort(c);
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n+m;++i)
            if(c[i]!=c[i+1])
                ans++;
        out.println(ans);
        out.close();
    }
