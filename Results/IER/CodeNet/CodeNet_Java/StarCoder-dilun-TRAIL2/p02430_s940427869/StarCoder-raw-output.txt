he variable n is initialized with 5 and variable k is initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2^5 - 1.
Inside the for loop, it initializes an array bitArray with n elements.
Then it initializes a variable temp with the current interger i.
Then it initializes a variable count with 0.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger temp is odd or not.
If it is odd, it sets the j-th element of bitArray to 1 and increments the value of variable count by 1.
Then it divides the current interger temp by 2.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable count is equal to the value of variable k.
If it is, it prints the current interger i as the index of the permutation and then it prints the elements of bitArray that are 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
