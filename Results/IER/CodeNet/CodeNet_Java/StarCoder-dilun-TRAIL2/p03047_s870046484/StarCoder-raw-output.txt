he variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The value of variable ans is calculated by subtracting 1 from variable b and then adding it to variable a.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
       Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
       
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();

        // 出力
      
      int ans = a + (b -1);
      
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
