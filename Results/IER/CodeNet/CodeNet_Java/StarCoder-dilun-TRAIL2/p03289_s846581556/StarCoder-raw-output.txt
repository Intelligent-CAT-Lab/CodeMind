e variable s is initialized with the input.
The variable array is initialized with the character array of variable s.
The variable countC is initialized with 0.
The variable judge is initialized with true.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable array. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is 0 or not. If it is, it checks if the character at index i of variable array is equal to 'A'. If it is, it sets variable judge to true.
If the current interger i is between 2 and the length of variable array minus 2, it checks if the character at index i of variable array is equal to 'C'. If it is, it increments variable countC by 1.
If the current interger i is greater than or equal to the length of variable array minus 2, it checks if the character at index i of variable array is a lowercase letter. If it is, it sets variable judge to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if variable judge is true and if variable countC is equal to 1. If it is, it sets the value of variable result to 'AC'. Otherwise, it sets the value of variable result to 'WA'.
<<<Output>>>
AC

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String args[]) {

        // 入力
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();

        // 主処理
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'A') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
        sc.close();
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```AtCoder```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop
