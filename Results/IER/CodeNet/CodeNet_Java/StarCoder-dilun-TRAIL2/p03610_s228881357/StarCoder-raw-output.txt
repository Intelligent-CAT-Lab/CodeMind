he variable s is initialized with the input string "atcoder".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s divided by 2. The value of variable i is also passed to the index of the character in variable s.
Inside the for loop, it appends the character at the current index to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is "ac".
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		
		for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		
		sc.close();
		
		int max = arr[0];
		int min = arr[0];
		
		for(int i=1; i<n; i++) {
			if(arr[i] > max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
			if(arr[i] < min) {
				min = arr[i];
			}
		}
		
		System.out.println(max - min);

	}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to variable n. The value of variable i is also passed to the index of the element in array arr.
Inside the for loop, it reads the next integer from the input and assigns it to the current element of array arr.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to variable n. The value of variable i is also passed to the index of the element in array arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if
