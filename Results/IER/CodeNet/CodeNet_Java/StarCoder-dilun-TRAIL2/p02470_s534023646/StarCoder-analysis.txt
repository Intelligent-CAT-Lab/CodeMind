e variable n is initialized with 6.
The for loop iterates from 2 to the square root of 6.
If the current interger i is a factor of n, it adds it to the list.
While the current interger i is a factor of n, it divides n by i.
If n is not 1, it adds it to the list.
The for loop iterates through the list and calculates the product of the list elements.
The final value of variable k is calculated by multiplying the product of the list elements by (n - 1).
The final value of variable t is calculated by dividing n by the product of the list elements.
The final value of variable k is multiplied by t to get the final output.
