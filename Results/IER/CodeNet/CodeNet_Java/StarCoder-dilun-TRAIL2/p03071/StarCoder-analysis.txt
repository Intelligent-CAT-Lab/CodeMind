he variable A and variable B are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger A is greater than or equal to B. If it is, it adds the current interger A to variable c and subtracts 1 from A.
If the condition is not met, it adds the current interger B to variable c and subtracts 1 from B.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable c as output, which is 10.
