he variable n is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i*i is less than or equal to n. If it is, it increments the value of variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      	//数値の入力
		long n = sc.nextLong();
      	long count = 0;
      	
        for(long i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        	if(i*i<=n){
              count++;
            }
        }
              System.out.println(count*count);
     }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 100 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i*i is less than or equal to n. If it is, it increments the value of variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
