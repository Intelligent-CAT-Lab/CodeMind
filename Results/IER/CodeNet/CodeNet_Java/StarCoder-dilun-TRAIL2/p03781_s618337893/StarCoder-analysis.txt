e variable X is initialized with 6.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to infinity to check each integer time in this range. The value of variable time is also passed to variable pow.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the current interger time by adding it to variable pow.
Then it checks if the calculated variable pow is less than or equal to the input X. If it is, it prints the current interger time as output, which is 2.
