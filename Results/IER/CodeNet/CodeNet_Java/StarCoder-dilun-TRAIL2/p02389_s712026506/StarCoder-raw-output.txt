he variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The variable res is initialized with the string representation of the product of a and b.
Then it appends a space character to the variable res.
Then it appends the string representation of the sum of 2*a and 2*b to the variable res.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 15 21.
<<<Output>>>
15 21

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		
		int res = a * b;
		res += 2*a + 2*b;
		System.out.println(res);
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
