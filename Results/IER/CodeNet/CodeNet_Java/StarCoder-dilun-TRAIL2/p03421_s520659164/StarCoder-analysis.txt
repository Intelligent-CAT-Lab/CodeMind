he variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the condition a<=n, b<=n and b<=n-a+1 are met. If not, it prints -1 and exits the program.
If the condition is met, it initializes variable lowerBound with 0 and variable start with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to variable a to check each integer cnt in this range. The value of variable cnt is also passed to variable len.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the length of the current range of integers by taking the minimum of variable b and n-start-a+cnt+1.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to variable len-1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable len.
Inside the for loop, it prints the value of variable lowerBound+len-j.
After the loop finishes, it increments variable start by the value of variable len.
After the loop finishes, it increments variable lowerBound by the value of variable len.
