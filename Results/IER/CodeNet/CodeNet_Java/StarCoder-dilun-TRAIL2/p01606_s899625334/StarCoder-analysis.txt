e variable N is initialized with 10 and variable W is initialized with 2.
The array a is initialized with 22 elements. The first element is initialized with 10/2 = 5.
The for loop iterates from 5 to 20. The variable i is initialized with 5.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it adds 1 to the first element of the array a.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from i to N. The variable j is initialized with i.
Inside the for loop, it checks if j is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it adds 1 to the element of the array a that corresponds to j-W+1.
Then it subtracts 1 from the element of the array a that corresponds to j+1.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from W to N. The variable i is initialized with W.
Inside the for loop, it adds 1 to the element of the array a that corresponds to i-W+1.
Then it subtracts 1 from the element of the array a that corresponds to i+1.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to N-W+1. The variable i is initialized with 1.
Inside the for loop, it adds the value of the element of the array a that corresponds to i-1 to the element of the array a that corresponds to i.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to N-W+1. The variable i is initialized with 1.
Inside the for loop, it appends the value of the element of the array a that corresponds to i to the string builder sb.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of the string builder sb as output.
