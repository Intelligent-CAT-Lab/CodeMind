he variable S is initialized with the input string "abac".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string S. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character x is equal to 'a', 'b' or 'c'. If it is, it increments the corresponding counter variable.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum of the three counter variables is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
