he variable S is initialized with the input string "abac".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string S. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character x is equal to 'a', 'b' or 'c'. If it is, it increments the corresponding counter variable.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum of the three counter variables is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it prints "YES" as output. Otherwise, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    String S = sc.next();
    int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++) {
      char x = S.charAt(i);
      if (x == 'a') a++;
      if (x == 'b') b++;
      if (x == 'c') c++;
    }
    if (Math.max(Math.max(a,b),c)-Math.min(Math.min(a,b),c) <= 1) {
      System.out.println("YES");
    } else {
      System.out.println("NO");
    } 
  }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abac
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
