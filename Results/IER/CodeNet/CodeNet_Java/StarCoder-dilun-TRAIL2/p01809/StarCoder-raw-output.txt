e variable p and variable q are initialized with 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable qs is initialized with the value of variable q divided by the value of variable buf.
The variable ans is initialized with 1.
The variable bp is initialized with the value of variable p.
The variable bq is initialized with the value of variable q.
The variable buf is initialized with the value of variable p.
The while loop checks if the value of variable bq divided by the value of variable bp is not equal to 0.
If it is not equal to 0, then the value of variable buf is set to the value of variable bq divided by the value of variable bp.
Then the value of variable bq is set to the value of variable bp.
Then the value of variable bp is set to the value of variable buf.
Then the value of variable qs is set to the value of variable q divided by the value of variable buf.
Then the for loop checks if the value of variable qs is divisible by the current interger i.
If it is divisible, then the while loop checks if the value of variable qs is divisible by the current interger i.
If it is divisible, then the value of variable qs is set to the value of variable qs divided by the current interger i.
Then the value of variable ans is set to the value of variable ans multiplied by the current interger i.
Then the while loop checks if the value of variable qs is not equal to 0.
If it is not equal to 0, then the value of variable ans is set to the value of variable ans multiplied by the value of variable qs.
Then the while loop checks if the current interger i is less than or equal to the square root of the value of variable qs.
If it is less than or equal to the square root of the value of variable qs, then the for loop repeats.
After the for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
