he variable W is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It calculates the final value of variable W by multiplying it with 32.
After the calculation, it print the fianl value of variable W as output, which is 128.
<<<Output>>>
128

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int W = scan.nextInt();
        
       
        
        
        System.out.println(W*32);
        
    }
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
