he variable a is initialized with 3, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It sorts the array a in ascending order.
Then it checks if the first, second and third elements of the array a are odd. If they are, it calculates the product of the first and second elements of the array a and assigns it to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    int[] a = new int[n];
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      a[i] = sc.nextInt();
    }
    Arrays.sort(a);
    int ans = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if(a[i] % 2 == 0) {
        ans += a[i];
      }
    }
    System.out.println(ans);
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
The variable a is initialized with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It sorts the array a in ascending order.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is even. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 0,2,4.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
