he variable str is initialized with the input.
It creates an array of 4 strings named ch.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the character at index i from variable str and assigns it to the corresponding index of array ch.
Then it converts the string at index 0 of array ch to an integer named a.
Then it converts the string at index 1 of array ch to an integer named b.
Then it converts the string at index 2 of array ch to an integer named c.
Then it converts the string at index 3 of array ch to an integer named d.
Then it checks if the sum of a, b, c and d is equal to 7. If it is, it assigns the string "+","+" and "+" to the corresponding indices of array ans.
If the sum of a, b, c and d is equal to 11, it assigns the string "+","+" and "-" to the corresponding indices of array ans.
If the sum of a, b, c and d is equal to 15, it assigns the string "+","-" and "+" to the corresponding indices of array ans.
If the sum of a, b, c and d is equal to 19, it assigns the string "-","+" and "+" to the corresponding indices of array ans.
If the sum of a, b, c and d is equal to 23, it assigns the string "+","-" and "-" to the corresponding indices of array ans.
If the sum of a, b, c and d is equal to 27, it assigns the string "-","+" and "-" to the corresponding indices of array ans.
If the sum of a, b, c and d is equal to 31, it assigns the string "-","-" and "+" to the corresponding indices of array ans.
If the sum of a, b, c and d is equal to 35, it assigns the string "-","-" and "-" to the corresponding indices of array ans.
Then it prints the concatenation of the string at index 0 of array ch, the string at index 0 of array ans, the string at index 1 of array ch, the string at index 1 of array ans, the string at index 2 of array ch, the string at index 2 of array ans, the string at index 3 of array ch and the string at index 3 of array ans.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		int d = sc.nextInt();

		int sum = a + b + c + d;
		int diff = a - b - c - d;
		int prod = a * b * c * d;

		System.out.println(sum);
		System.out.println(diff);
		System.out.println(prod);
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input.
Then it initializes the variables a, b, c and d with the values of the input.
Then it calculates the sum of a, b, c and d and assigns it to variable sum.
Then it calculates the difference of a, b, c and d and assigns it to variable diff.
Then it calculates the product of a, b, c and d and assigns it to variable prod.
Then it prints the value of variable sum.
Then it prints the value of variable diff.
Then it prints the value of variable prod.
<<<Output>>>
