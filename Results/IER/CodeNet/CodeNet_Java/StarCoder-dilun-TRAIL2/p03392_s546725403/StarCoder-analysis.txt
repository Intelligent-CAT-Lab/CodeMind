variable S is initialized with the input string "abc". The variable N is initialized with the length of the input string.
The variable all is initialized with true. The variable any is initialized with false. The variable sum is initialized with the last digit of the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N - 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the input string is equal to the next character of the input string. If it is not, the variable all is set to false.
If the current character of the input string is equal to the next character of the input string, the variable any is set to true.
It also adds the current character of the input string to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the variable all is true. If it is true, it prints 1 as output.
If the variable all is false, it checks if the variable any is false. If it is false, it checks if the length of the input string is 2. If it is 2, it prints 2 as output.
If the variable any is true, it checks if the length of the input string is 3. If it is 3, it checks if the first character of the input string is not equal to the last character of the input string. If it is not, it prints 3 as output.
If the variable any is false, it checks if the length of the input string is 3. If it is 3, it checks if the first character of the input string is equal to the last character of the input string. If it is true, it prints 3 as output.
If the variable any is false and the length of the input string is not 3, it checks if the length of the input string is 2. If it is 2, it prints 2 as output.
If the variable any is false and the length of the input string is not 2, it checks if the length of the input string is 1. If it is 1, it prints 1 as output.
