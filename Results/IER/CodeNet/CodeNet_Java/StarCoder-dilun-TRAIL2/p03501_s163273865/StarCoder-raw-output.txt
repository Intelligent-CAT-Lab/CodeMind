he variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 7, 17 and 120 respectively according to the input.
The variable pp is initialized with the product of N and A, which is 119.
Then it checks if the product of N and A is greater than B. If it is, it prints the value of B. Otherwise, it prints the value of pp.
<<<Output>>>
120

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N,A,B,pp;
        N=sc.nextInt();
        A=sc.nextInt();
        B=sc.nextInt();
        pp=N*A;

        if(pp>B) System.out.println(B);
        else System.out.println(pp);
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 17 120
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
