he variable x and variable y are initialized with 4 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable p.x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable p.y by subtracting the value of variable y from the value of variable p.x multiplied by the value of variable a.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable p.y.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable p.x by subtracting the value of variable y from the value of variable p.y divided by the value of variable a.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the size of the list cx.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current point p is the same as the point in the list cx. If it is, it prints the size of the list cx as output.
