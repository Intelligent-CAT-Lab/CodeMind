he variable x and variable y are initialized with 4 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable p.x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable p.y by subtracting the value of variable y from the value of variable p.x multiplied by the value of variable a.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable p.y.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable p.x by subtracting the value of variable y from the value of variable p.y divided by the value of variable a.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the size of the list cx.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current point p is the same as the point in the list cx. If it is, it prints the size of the list cx as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner in=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=in.nextInt();
		int a[]=new int[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
			a[i]=in.nextInt();
		}
		int max=0;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
			int sum=0;
			for(int j=i;j<n;j++) {
				sum+=a[j];
				if(sum>max) {
					max=sum;
				}
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max);
	}

}
