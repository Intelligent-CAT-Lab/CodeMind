he variable name is initialized with the input.
The substring method of the String class is called to extract the first 3 characters of the variable name.
The first 3 characters of the variable name are printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
  	public static void main(String args[]){
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      String name = sc.next();
      System.out.print(name.substring(name.length()-3,name.length()));
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```takahashi
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable name is initialized with the input.
The length method of the String class is called to get the length of the variable name.
The substring method of the String class is called to extract the last 3 characters of the variable name.
The last 3 characters of the variable name are printed as output.
