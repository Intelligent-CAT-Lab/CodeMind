he variable L, variable R and variable d are initialized with 5, 10 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 5 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by 2. If it is, it adds 1 to variable Ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable Ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public Main() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int K = scanner.nextInt();

        int Ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            if (i % K == 0)
                Ans++;
        }

        System.out.println(Ans);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Main();
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
