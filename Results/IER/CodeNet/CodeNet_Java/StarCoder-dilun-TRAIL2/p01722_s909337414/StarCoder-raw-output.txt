he variable str is initialized with an empty string.
The variable mjs is initialized with 0.
It enters a if-else-if-else statement.
The value of variable mjs is checked and if it is 0, it prints 1 as output.
If it is 1, it prints 2 as output.
If it is 2, it prints 1 as output.
If it is greater than 2, it prints 0 as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader bfr=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String str="";
		int mjs=0;

		str=bfr.readLine();
		mjs=Integer.parseInt(str);

		if(mjs==0) {
			System.out.println("1");
		}
		else if(mjs==1) {
			System.out.println("2");
		}
		else if(mjs==2) {
			System.out.println("1");
		}
		else if(mjs>=3) {
			System.out.println("0");
		}
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
