variable H and variable W are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The value of variable H is compared with the value of variable W. If the value of variable H is greater than the value of variable W, the values of variables H and W are swapped.
Then the value of variable H is compared with 1. If the value of variable H is not equal to 1, the value of variable W is divided by 2 and the value of variable H is divided by 2. The value of variable W is multiplied by the value of variable H and the value of variable H is multiplied by the value of variable W. The sum of the values of variables W and H is added to the value of variable W.
Then the value of variable H is compared with 1. If the value of variable H is equal to 1, the value of variable W is divided by 2 and the value of variable H is divided by 2.
