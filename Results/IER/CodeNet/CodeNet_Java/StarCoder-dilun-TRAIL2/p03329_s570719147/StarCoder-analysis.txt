NO-ANSWER
he variable n is initialized with 127 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 1 to 127 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current interger tmp is less than or equal to n. If it is, it adds the current interger tmp to the set.
Then it checks if the current interger tmp is less than or equal to n. If it is, it adds the current interger tmp to the set.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i plus the current interger x is less than or equal to n. If it is, it checks if the current interger i plus the current interger x is less than or equal to n. If it is, it adds the current interger i plus the current interger x to the set.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i plus the current interger x is less than or equal to n. If it is, it checks if the current interger i plus the current interger x is less than or equal to n. If it is, it adds the current interger i plus the current interger x to the set.
