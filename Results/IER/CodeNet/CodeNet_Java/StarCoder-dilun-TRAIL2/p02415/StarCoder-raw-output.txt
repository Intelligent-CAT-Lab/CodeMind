 variable n is initialized with the input.
The variable num is initialized with the length of the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to num-1 to check each character i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character i is lowercase, uppercase or space. If it is, it prints the corresponding character in uppercase, lowercase or space.
If it is not, it prints the character i.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
<<<Output>>>
Fair, later, occasionally cloudy.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
//8-B
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String [] args){
    	
    	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        String n = sc.nextLine();
        
        int num = n.length();
        
        for( int i = 0 ; i < num ; i++ ){
        	
        	if(Character.isLowerCase(n.charAt(i))){
        		
                System.out.print(Character.toUpperCase(n.charAt(i)));
                
            }else if(Character.isUpperCase(n.charAt(i))){
            	
                System.out.print(Character.toLowerCase(n.charAt(i)));
                
            }/*else if( n.charAt(i) ==''){
            	
            	System.out.print(' ');
            	
            }*/else{
            	
                System.out.print(n.charAt(i));
                
            }
        	
        }
        
        System.out.println();
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input.
The variable num is initialized with the length of the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to num-1 to check each character i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character i is lowercase, uppercase or space. If it is, it prints the corresponding character in uppercase, lowercase or space.
