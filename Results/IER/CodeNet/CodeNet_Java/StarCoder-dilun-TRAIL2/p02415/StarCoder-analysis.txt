variable n is initialized with the input.
The variable num is initialized with the length of the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to num-1 to check each character i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character i is lowercase, uppercase or space. If it is, it prints the corresponding character in uppercase, lowercase or space.
If it is not, it prints the character i.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
