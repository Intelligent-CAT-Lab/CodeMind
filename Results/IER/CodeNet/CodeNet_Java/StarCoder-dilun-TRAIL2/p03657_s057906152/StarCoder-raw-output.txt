e variable A and variable B are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if either A or B is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints "Possible".
If neither A nor B is divisible by 3, it checks if the sum of A and B is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints "Possible".
If neither A nor B is divisible by 3 and the sum of A and B is not divisible by 3, it prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Impossible

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.IOException;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        try (
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
                new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            final String s = reader.readLine();

            final String sl[] = s.split(" ");
            int A = Integer.parseInt(sl[0]);
            int B = Integer.parseInt(sl[1]);

            System.out.println(
                A % 3 == 0 || B % 3 == 0 || (A + B) % 3 == 0?
                    "Possible" : "Impossible");
        }
    }
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if either A or B is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints "Possible".
If neither A nor B is divisible by 3, it checks if the sum of A and B is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints "Possible".
If neither A nor B is divisible by 3 and the sum of A and B is not divisible by 3, it prints "Impossible".
