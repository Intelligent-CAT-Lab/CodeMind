e variable profile is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates over each character c in the string profile.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character c is '\\' or '/'.
If it is '\\', it decreases the value of variable lv by 1.
If it is '/', it increases the value of variable lv by 1.
If the character c is '\\', it pushes the current value of variable pos to the stackDown.
If the character c is '/', it checks if the stackDown is empty.
If it is not empty, it pops the top element of stackDown and stores it in variable start.
Then it calculates the area of the current character c by subtracting the current value of variable pos from the value of variable start.
It adds the calculated area to the variable totalArea.
If the stackArea is empty, it pushes the calculated area to the stackArea and pushes the value of variable lv to the stackEdge.
If the stackArea is not empty, it pops the top element of stackEdge and stores it in variable lastArea.
It checks if the value of variable lv is less than the value of the popped element.
If it is, it pops the top element of stackArea and adds it to the variable lastArea.
It pushes the calculated area to the stackArea and pushes the value of variable lv to the stackEdge.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable totalArea as output.
It prints the size of stackArea as output.
If the size of stackArea is not 0, it prints a space.
It enters a while loop and it iterates over each element in stackArea.
Inside the while loop, it prints the current element.
If there are more elements in stackArea, it prints a space.
After the while loop finishes, it prints an empty line.
