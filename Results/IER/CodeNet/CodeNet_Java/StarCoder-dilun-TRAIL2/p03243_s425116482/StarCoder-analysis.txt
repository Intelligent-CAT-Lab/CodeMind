e variable n is initialized with 111.
The first digit of variable n is extracted and stored in variable san.
The value of variable san is multiplied by 100, 10 and 1 to get the value of variable ok.
The value of variable n is converted to integer and compared with the value of variable ok.
If the value of variable n is less than or equal to the value of variable ok, then the value of variable ok is printed as output.
Otherwise, the value of variable san is incremented by 1 and the value of variable ok is recalculated.
