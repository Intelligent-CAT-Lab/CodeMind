he variable n is initialized with 10.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the square root of n is an integer. If it is, it prints the value of n and returns.
If the square root of n is not an integer, it decrements the value of n by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of n as output, which is 9.
