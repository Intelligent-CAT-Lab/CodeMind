he variable num is initialized with an array of length 3. The array is initialized with the values 10, 30 and 20 respectively according to the input.
The array is sorted in ascending order.
Then it checks if the sum of the first two elements of the array is equal to the third element. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))){
			String[] spl = br.readLine().split(" ");
			int[] num = new int[spl.length];
			for(int i = 0;i <spl.length;i++) {
				num[i] = Integer.parseInt(spl[i]);
			}
			Arrays.sort(num);
			if(num[0] + num[1] == num[2]) {
				System.out.println("Yes");
			}else {
				System.out.println("No");
			}
		} catch (IOException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 30 20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
