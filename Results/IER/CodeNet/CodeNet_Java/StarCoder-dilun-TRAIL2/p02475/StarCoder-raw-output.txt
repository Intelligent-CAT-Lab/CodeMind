TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = scan.nextInt();
		int a = scan.nextInt();
		int b = scan.nextInt();
		int c = scan.nextInt();
		int d = scan.nextInt();
		int e = scan.nextInt();
		int f = scan.nextInt();
		int g = scan.nextInt();
		int h = scan.nextInt();
		int i = scan.nextInt();
		int j = scan.nextInt();
		int k = scan.nextInt();
		int l = scan.nextInt();
		int m = scan.nextInt();
		int answer = 0;
		for (int x = 0; x < n; x++) {
			int num = scan.nextInt();
			if (num >= a && num <= b) {
				answer++;
			}
			if (num >= c && num <= d) {
				answer++;
			}
			if (num >= e && num <= f) {
				answer++;
			}
			if (num >= g && num <= h) {
				answer++;
			}
			if (num >= i && num <= j) {
				answer++;
			}
			if (num >= k && num <= l) {
				answer++;
			}
			if (num >= m && num <= m) {
				answer++;
