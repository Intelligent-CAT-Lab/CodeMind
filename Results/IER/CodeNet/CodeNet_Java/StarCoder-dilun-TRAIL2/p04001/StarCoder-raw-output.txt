he variable S is initialized with the input.
The variable N is initialized with an array of length of the input.
The variable patternCount is initialized with 1.
The variable tmpBit is initialized with an empty string.
The for loop iterates from 0 to the length of the input.
Inside the for loop, it converts the character at index i of the input to an integer and assigns it to the array N at index i.
Then it checks if i is greater than 0. If it is, it multiplies the current value of patternCount by 2 and concatenates the string "1" to the variable tmpBit.
After the for loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the current value of patternCount.
Inside the for loop, it converts the current interger i to a binary string and assigns it to the variable bin.
Then it checks if the length of the binary string bin is less than the length of the variable tmpBit. If it is, it concatenates the string "0" to the binary string bin.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the binary string bin.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index j of the binary string bin is equal to "1". If it is, it adds the value of the integer at index 0 of the array N to the variable sum.
Then it assigns an empty string to the variable add.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the variable add.
Inside the for loop, it concatenates the string at index j+1 of the array N to the variable add.
Then it checks if the length of the variable add is greater than 0. If it is, it adds the value of the variable add to the variable sum.
After the for loop finishes, it checks if the length of the variable add is greater than 0. If it is, it adds the value of the variable add to the variable sum.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the final value of the variable sum as output.
