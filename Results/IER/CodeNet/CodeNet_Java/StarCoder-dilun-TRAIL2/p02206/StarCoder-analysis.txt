he variable n is initialized with 1 and variable k is initialized with 1.
The variable left is initialized with 1 and variable right is initialized with 2.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the difference between right and left is greater than 1.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable m as the average of left and right.
Then it calculates the value of variable x as the value of variable m.
Then it calculates the value of variable total as 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable total as the sum of variable total and variable x.
Then it checks if the calculated variable total is less than or equal to variable k. If it is, it updates the value of variable left to variable m.
Otherwise, it updates the value of variable right to variable m.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable left as output, which is 1.
