he variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 1, 2, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable ac is initialized with the product of a and c.
The variable ad is initialized with the product of a and d.
The variable bd is initialized with the product of b and d.
The variable bc is initialized with the product of b and c.
The variable ac is compared with the variable ad, variable bc and variable bd. The maximum of these three values is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		var sc = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
		var a = sc.nextBigInteger();
		var b = sc.nextBigInteger();
		var c=sc.nextBigInteger();
		var d = sc.nextBigInteger();
		var ac = a.multiply(c);
		var ad = a.multiply(d);
		var bd = b.multiply(d);
		var bc = b.multiply(c);
		System.out.println(ad.min(ac.min(bc.min(bd))));
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 1 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 1, 2, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable ac is initialized with the product of a and c.
The variable ad is initialized with the product of a and d.
The variable bd is initialized with the product of b and d.
The variable bc is initialized with the product of b and c.
The variable ac is compared with the variable ad, variable bc and variable bd. The minimum of these three values is printed as output.
