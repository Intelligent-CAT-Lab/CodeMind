he variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable nk is initialized with 1 and the variable mk is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable nk.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i with variable nk by repeatedlly multiplying it with variable nk.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable mk.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger i with variable mk by repeatedlly multiplying it with variable mk.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable n is equal to the value of variable m. If it is, it calculates the product of 2 with the product of variable nk and variable mk.
Then it calculates the modulo of the product of 2 with the product of variable nk and variable mk.
Then it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
