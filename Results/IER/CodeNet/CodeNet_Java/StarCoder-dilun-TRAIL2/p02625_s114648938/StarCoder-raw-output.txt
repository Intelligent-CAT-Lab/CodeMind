e variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is initialized with 2.
The variable factorial is initialized with an array of length 3. The first element is 1 and the rest are 0.
The variable revFactorial is initialized with an array of length 3. The first element is 1 and the rest are 0.
The variable answer is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable result.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable result.
The value of variable result is calculated by multiplying the following values:
(−1)^i × n_C_i
m_P_i × (m-i_P_n-i)^2

(−1)^i × n_C_i
m_P_i × (m-i_P_n-i)^2
