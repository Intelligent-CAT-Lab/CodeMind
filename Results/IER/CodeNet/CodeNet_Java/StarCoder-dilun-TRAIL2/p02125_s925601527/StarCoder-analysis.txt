e variable N is initialized with 2.
The variable binaryNumDigits is initialized with the length of the binary representation of N.
The variable ans is initialized with the value of binaryNumDigits.
If N is equal to 2^binaryNumDigits - 1, then the value of ans is set to binaryNumDigits.
Otherwise, the value of ans is set to binaryNumDigits - 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
