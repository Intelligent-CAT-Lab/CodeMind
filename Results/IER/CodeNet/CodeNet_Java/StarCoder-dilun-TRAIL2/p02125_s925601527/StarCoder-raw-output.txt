e variable N is initialized with 2.
The variable binaryNumDigits is initialized with the length of the binary representation of N.
The variable ans is initialized with the value of binaryNumDigits.
If N is equal to 2^binaryNumDigits - 1, then the value of ans is set to binaryNumDigits.
Otherwise, the value of ans is set to binaryNumDigits - 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		solve3027();
	}

	public static void solve3027() {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int binaryNumDigits = Integer.toBinaryString(N).length();

		int ans = N == Math.pow(2, binaryNumDigits) - 1? binaryNumDigits : binaryNumDigits - 1;
		System.out.println(ans);

		sc.close();
	}
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3.
The variable binaryNumDigits is initialized with the length of the binary representation of N.
The variable ans is initialized with the value of binaryNumDigits.
If N is equal to 2^binaryNumDigits - 1, then the value of ans is set to binaryNumDigits.
Otherwise, the value of ans is set to binaryNumDigits - 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
