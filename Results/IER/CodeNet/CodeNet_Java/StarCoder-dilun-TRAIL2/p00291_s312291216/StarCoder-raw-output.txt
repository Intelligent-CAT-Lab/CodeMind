he variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it checks the value of variable i and adds the current interger tmp to variable sum according to the value of i.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the calculated variable sum is greater than or equal to 1000. If it is, it prints 1 as output. Otherwise, it prints 0 as output.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
class Main {
	static int INF = -10000000;
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(System.in);
		int sum = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
			int tmp = stdIn.nextInt();
			switch(i) {
			case 0:
				sum += tmp;
				break;
			case 1:
				sum += tmp*5;
				break;
			case 2:
				sum += tmp*10;
				break;
			case 3:
				sum += tmp * 50;
				break;
			case 4:
				sum += tmp * 100;
				break;
			case 5:
				sum += tmp * 500;
				break;
			}
		}
		
		if(sum >= 1000) {
			System.out.println(1);
		}
		else {
			System.out.println(0);
		}
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 4 0 4 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
