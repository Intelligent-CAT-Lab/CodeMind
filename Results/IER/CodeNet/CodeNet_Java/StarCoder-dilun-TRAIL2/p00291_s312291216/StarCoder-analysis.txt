he variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it checks the value of variable i and adds the current interger tmp to variable sum according to the value of i.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the calculated variable sum is greater than or equal to 1000. If it is, it prints 1 as output. Otherwise, it prints 0 as output.
