he variable str is initialized with the input. Then it converts the string to an integer and stores it in variable num1.
Then it converts the first character of the string to an integer and stores it in variable a.
Then it converts the second character of the string to an integer and stores it in variable b.
Then it converts the third character of the string to an integer and stores it in variable c.
Then it calculates the value of variable num2 by multiplying 100 by variable c, adding 10 to variable b and adding variable a.
Then it checks if the value of variable num1 is equal to the value of variable num2. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    String str = sc.nextLine();
    int num1 = Integer.parseInt(str);
    int a = Integer.parseInt(""+str.charAt(0));
    int b = Integer.parseInt(""+str.charAt(1));
    int c = Integer.parseInt(""+str.charAt(2));
    int num2 = 100*c+10*b+a;
    if(num1==num2){
      System.out.println("Yes");
    }else{
      System.out.println("No");
    }
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```575
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
