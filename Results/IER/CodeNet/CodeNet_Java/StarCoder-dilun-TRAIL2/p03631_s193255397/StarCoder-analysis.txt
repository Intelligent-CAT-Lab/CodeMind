he variable str is initialized with the input. Then it converts the string to an integer and stores it in variable num1.
Then it converts the first character of the string to an integer and stores it in variable a.
Then it converts the second character of the string to an integer and stores it in variable b.
Then it converts the third character of the string to an integer and stores it in variable c.
Then it calculates the value of variable num2 by multiplying 100 by variable c, adding 10 to variable b and adding variable a.
Then it checks if the value of variable num1 is equal to the value of variable num2. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
