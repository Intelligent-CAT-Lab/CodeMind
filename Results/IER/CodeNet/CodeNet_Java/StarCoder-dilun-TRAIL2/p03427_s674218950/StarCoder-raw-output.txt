he variable n is initialized with 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of variable n. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of variable n is not equal to '9'. If it is not, it sets variable f to false and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks if variable f is true. If it is, it sets variable c to '0'. Otherwise, it sets variable c to '1'.
Then it calculates the final value of variable ans by adding the value of the first character of variable n minus variable c and multiplying it by (the length of variable n minus 1) multiplied by 9.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 99.
<<<Output>>>
99

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import static java.lang.Integer.*;
import static java.lang.Long.*;
import static java.lang.Math.*;
import static java.lang.System.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(in);
		String n = sc.next();
		sc.close();
		int ans = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n.length(); i++) {
			ans += (int)(n.charAt(i) - '0');
		}
		out.println(ans);
	}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable n. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the final value of variable ans by adding the value of the current character of variable n minus '0'.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl
