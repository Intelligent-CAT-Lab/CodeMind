he variable n is initialized with 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of variable n. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of variable n is not equal to '9'. If it is not, it sets variable f to false and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks if variable f is true. If it is, it sets variable c to '0'. Otherwise, it sets variable c to '1'.
Then it calculates the final value of variable ans by adding the value of the first character of variable n minus variable c and multiplying it by (the length of variable n minus 1) multiplied by 9.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 99.
