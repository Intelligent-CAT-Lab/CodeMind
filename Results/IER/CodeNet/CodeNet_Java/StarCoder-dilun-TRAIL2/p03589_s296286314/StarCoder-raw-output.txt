he variable N is initialized with 2.
The variable starth is initialized with 3*N/4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from starth to 3500 to check each integer h in this range. The value of variable h is also passed to variable w.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3*N/4 to check each integer w in this range. The value of variable w is also passed to variable n.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable n by dividing N*h*w by 4*h*w-N*w-N*h.
Then it checks if the calculated variable n is positive and if the condition 4*h*n*w==N*(h*n+n*w+h*w) is met. If it is, it prints the values of h, n and w as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[N];
		for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int[] dp = new int[N];
		dp[0] = arr[0];
		for(int i=1; i<N; i++) {
			dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1]+arr[i], arr[i]);
		}
		System.out.println(dp[N-1]);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5.
The array arr is initialized with 5 elements.
The array dp is initialized with
