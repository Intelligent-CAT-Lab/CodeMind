he variable N is initialized with 2.
The variable starth is initialized with 3*N/4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from starth to 3500 to check each integer h in this range. The value of variable h is also passed to variable w.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3*N/4 to check each integer w in this range. The value of variable w is also passed to variable n.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable n by dividing N*h*w by 4*h*w-N*w-N*h.
Then it checks if the calculated variable n is positive and if the condition 4*h*n*w==N*(h*n+n*w+h*w) is met. If it is, it prints the values of h, n and w as output.
