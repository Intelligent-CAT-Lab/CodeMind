he variable s is initialized with the input string.
The variable v is initialized with 0.
The variable a is initialized with 0.
The variable b is initialized with 0.
The variable c is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index j of the string s is 'g'. If it is, it checks if the value of variable v is 0. If it is, it increments the value of variable v by 1 and increments the value of variable b by 1. If it is not, it decrements the value of variable v by 1 and increments the value of variable a by 1.
If the character at index j of the string s is not 'g', it checks if the value of variable v is 0. If it is, it increments the value of variable v by 1 and increments the value of variable c by 1. If it is not, it decrements the value of variable v by 1 and increments the value of variable b by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable a - c as output, which is 1.
