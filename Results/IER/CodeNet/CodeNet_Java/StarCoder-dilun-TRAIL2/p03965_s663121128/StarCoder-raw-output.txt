he variable s is initialized with the input string.
The variable v is initialized with 0.
The variable a is initialized with 0.
The variable b is initialized with 0.
The variable c is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index j of the string s is 'g'. If it is, it checks if the value of variable v is 0. If it is, it increments the value of variable v by 1 and increments the value of variable b by 1. If it is not, it decrements the value of variable v by 1 and increments the value of variable a by 1.
If the character at index j of the string s is not 'g', it checks if the value of variable v is 0. If it is, it increments the value of variable v by 1 and increments the value of variable c by 1. If it is not, it decrements the value of variable v by 1 and increments the value of variable b by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable a - c as output, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    String s = sc.next();
    int v = 0;
    int a = 0;
    int b = 0;
    int c = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      if(s.charAt(i) == 'g') {
        if(v == 0) {
          v++;
          b++;
        } else {
          v--;
          a++;
        }
      } else {
        if(v == 0) {
          v++;
          c++;
        } else {
          v--;
          b++;
        }
      }
    }
    System.out.println(a - c);
  }
}
</Code>
