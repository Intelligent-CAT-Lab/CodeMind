he variable s is initialized with the input.
The variable t is initialized with an empty string.
It enters a while loop and it reads the input line by line.
Inside the while loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string s.
Inside the for loop, it reads each character c of the input string s.
Then it checks if the character c is in the range [97, 123] or not. If it is, it converts the character c to its lowercase form and adds it to the variable t.
If the character c is not in the range [97, 123], it adds the character c to the variable t.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable t as output, which is this is a pen.
