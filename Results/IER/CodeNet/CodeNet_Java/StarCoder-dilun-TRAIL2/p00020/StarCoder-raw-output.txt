he variable s is initialized with the input.
The variable t is initialized with an empty string.
It enters a while loop and it reads the input line by line.
Inside the while loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string s.
Inside the for loop, it reads each character c of the input string s.
Then it checks if the character c is in the range [97, 123] or not. If it is, it converts the character c to its lowercase form and adds it to the variable t.
If the character c is not in the range [97, 123], it adds the character c to the variable t.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable t as output, which is this is a pen.
<<<Output>>>
this is a pen.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
		BufferedReader bf =new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String s,t;
		char c;
		while((s=bf.readLine())!=null){
			t="";for(int i=0,j=s.length();i<j;i++){c=s.charAt(i);t+=(char)((c>=65&&c<=90)?(c+32):(c));}
			System.out.println(t);
		}
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```THIS IS A PEN.
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
