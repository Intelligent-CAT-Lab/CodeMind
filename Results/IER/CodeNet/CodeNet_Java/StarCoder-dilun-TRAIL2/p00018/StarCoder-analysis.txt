e variable ans is initialized with 1,1,1,1,1.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it keeps iterating until the input is exhausted.
Inside the while loop, it reads the next integer from the input and assigns it to variable num.
Then it increments the value of variable count by 1.
Then it checks if the value of variable count is 5. If it is, it calls the method strkn() to calculate the final output.
The method strkn() sorts the array ans in descending order and then it concatenates the first four elements of the array ans to form a string.
The final output is the string formed by concatenating the first four elements of the array ans.
