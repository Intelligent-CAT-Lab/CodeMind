he variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized with 5, 7 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if the condition is met. The condition is met when A is equal to B and B is equal to C or A is not equal to B and A is not equal to C and B is not equal to C.
If the condition is met, it prints "Yes" as output.
If the condition is not met, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int A = scan.nextInt();
		int B = scan.nextInt();
		int C = scan.nextInt();

		if((A == B && B == C)||(A!=B && A!=C && B!=C) ) {
			System.out.println("No");
		}else {
			System.out.println("Yes");
		}
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
