he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 5, 14 and 80 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 5 to 14 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is divisible by variable c. If it is, it adds 1 to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 3.
