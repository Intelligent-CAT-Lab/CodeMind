he variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 1, 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if a == b && c == d || a == c && b == d || a == d && b == c.
The first condition is met when a == b && c == d, which is true.
The second condition is met when a == c && b == d, which is false.
The third condition is met when a == d && b == c, which is false.
The if statement prints "no" as output.
<<<Output>>>
no

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
    void solve(){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int d = sc.nextInt();
        if ( a == b && c == d ||
             a == c && b == d ||
             a == d && b == c ) System.out.println("yes");
        else System.out.println("no");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){ new Main().solve(); }
}



</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
