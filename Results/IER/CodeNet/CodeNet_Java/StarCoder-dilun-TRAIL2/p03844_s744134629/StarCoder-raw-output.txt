he variable i is initialized with 1 and variable j is initialized with 2.
The code reads the input from the standard input and splits it into three tokens. The first token is assigned to variable i, the second token is assigned to variable ch and the third token is assigned to variable j.
The code checks if the character ch is equal to '+' or '-'. If it is equal to '+', it prints the sum of i and j as output. If it is equal to '-', it prints the difference of i and j as output.

// Imports
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    /**

        // TODO UNCOMMENT WHEN ALGORITHM CORRECT
        BufferedReader f = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        
        // TODO code application logic here
        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(f.readLine());
        long i = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());
        char ch = st.nextToken().charAt(0);
        long j = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());
        
        if(ch == '+') {
            System.out.println(i + j);
        }
        else {
            System.out.println(i - j);

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 - 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
