he variable i is initialized with 1 and variable j is initialized with 2.
The code reads the input from the standard input and splits it into three tokens. The first token is assigned to variable i, the second token is assigned to variable ch and the third token is assigned to variable j.
The code checks if the character ch is equal to '+' or '-'. If it is equal to '+', it prints the sum of i and j as output. If it is equal to '-', it prints the difference of i and j as output.
