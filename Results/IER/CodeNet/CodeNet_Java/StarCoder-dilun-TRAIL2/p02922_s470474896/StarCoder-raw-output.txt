he variable X is initialized with 4 and variable Y is initialized with 10.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the condition ((X-1)*i +1 )<Y is met.
The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable i as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int X = sc.nextInt();
        int Y = sc.nextInt();

        int i = 0;
        while(((X-1)*i +1 )<Y){
            i++;
        }
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
