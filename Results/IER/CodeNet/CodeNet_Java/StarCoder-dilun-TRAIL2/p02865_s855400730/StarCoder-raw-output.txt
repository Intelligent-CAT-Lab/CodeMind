he variable N is initialized with 4.
It calculates the value of (N-1)/2 and prints it as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
