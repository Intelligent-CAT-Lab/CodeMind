ariable n is initialized with 6.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to sqrt n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a divisor of n-1. If it is, it adds +1 to variable n1.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a divisor of n. If it is, it adds +1 to variable n2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable n1 + n2 as output, which is 11.
