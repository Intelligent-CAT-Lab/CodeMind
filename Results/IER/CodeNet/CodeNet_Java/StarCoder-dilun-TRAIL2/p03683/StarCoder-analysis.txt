he variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the absolute value of n-m is greater than 1. If it is, it sets the value of variable result to 0.
If the absolute value of n-m is equal to 1, it calls the method factorialsModBillion(n, m) to calculate the result.
If the absolute value of n-m is not equal to 1, it calls the method factorialsModBillion(n, m) to calculate the result.
Then it multiplies the result by 2 and mod 1000000007 to get the final result.
