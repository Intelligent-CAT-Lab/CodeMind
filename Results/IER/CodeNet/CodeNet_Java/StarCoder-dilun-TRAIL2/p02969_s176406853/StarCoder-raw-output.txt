TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main{
	
    public static void main(String[] args){

	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	int n = sc.nextInt();

	int a = 0;
	int b = 0;

	for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
	    if(i%2==0){
		a = a+i;
	    }
	    else{
		b = b+i;
	    }
	}

	System.out.println(a);
	System.out.println(b);

  }
 }
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is even or odd. If it is even, it adds i to variable a. If it is odd, it adds i to variable b.
After the loop finishes, it print the final values of variables a and b as output, which are 25 and 15.
<<<Output>>>
25
15
