he variable alpha is initialized with the 26 characters of the alphabet.
The variable in is initialized with the input string.
The variable inChar is initialized with the characters of the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 26.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current character of the input string is equal to the jth character of the alphabet.
If it is, it replaces the current character of the input string with the jth character of the alphabet, where j is the number of times the current character of the input string has been replaced.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string.
Inside the second for loop, it appends the current character of the input string to the variable ans.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints the final value of the variable ans as output.
