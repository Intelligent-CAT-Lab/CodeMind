e variable n, variable m and variable k are initialized with 2, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the integers from 1 to n-i and adds it to variable temp.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the integers from 1 to m-i and adds it to variable temp.
