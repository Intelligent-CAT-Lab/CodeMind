variable s is initialized with the string "aabxyyzz".
The variable d is initialized with an array of 1<<26 elements.
The variable mask is initialized with 0.
The variable ans is initialized with the length of the string s.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable c by subtracting the character at index i of the string s from 'a'.
Then it calculates the value of variable m by XORing the value of variable mask with 1<<c.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from -1 to 25.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable cur by adding 1 to the value of variable d at index m^mask.
Then it updates the value of variable d at index mask with the minimum of the value of variable d at index mask and the value of variable cur.
Then it checks if i is equal to the length of the string s. If it is, it updates the value of variable ans with the minimum of the value of variable ans and the value of variable cur.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
