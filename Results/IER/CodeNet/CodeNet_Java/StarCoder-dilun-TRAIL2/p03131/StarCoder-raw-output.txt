he variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 2 and 6 respectively according to the input.
The variable sum is initialized with 1+K.
If A < B, it enters a if statement.
Inside the if statement, it calculates the sum of the first half of the range [A, B] by adding 1 to variable sum1.
Then it checks if A > sum1. If it does, it subtracts A-sum1 from variable K.
Then it calculates the sum of the second half of the range [A, B] by multiplying (B-A) by (K/2).
If K is odd, it adds 1 to the sum.
Then it checks if the calculated sum is greater than the current value of variable sum. If it does, it updates the value of variable sum with the calculated sum.
If A >= B, it enters a else statement.
Inside the else statement, it calculates the sum of the range [A, B] by adding 1 to variable sum1.
Then it checks if A > sum1. If it does, it subtracts A-sum1 from variable K.
Then it calculates the sum of the range [A, B] by multiplying (B-A) by (K/2).
If K is odd, it adds 1 to the sum.
Then it checks if the calculated sum is greater than the current value of variable sum. If it does, it updates the value of variable sum with the calculated sum.
Finally, it prints the final value of variable sum as output.
