he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 50, 100 and 120 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to c. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output. Otherwise, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	  public static void main(String args[]){
      	Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
            
        int a = scan.nextInt();
        int b = scan.nextInt();
        int c = scan.nextInt();
        
        String cnt;
        
        if( a + b >= c )cnt = "Yes";
        else 
          cnt = "No";
            
        System.out.println(cnt);
        
      }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```50 100 120
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
