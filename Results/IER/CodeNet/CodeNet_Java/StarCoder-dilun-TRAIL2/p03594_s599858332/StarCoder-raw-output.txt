 variable H, variable W and variable d are initialized with 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable v.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable v by dividing i by d and taking the remainder.
Then it checks if the calculated variable v is 0 or 1. If it is 0, it adds 0 to variable v. If it is 1, it adds 2 to variable v.
Then it checks if the current interger j is the last one in the row. If it is, it prints the character of the mode corresponding to the value of variable v.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output, which is 
```
R
Y
G
B
```
<<<Output>>>
R
Y
G
B
