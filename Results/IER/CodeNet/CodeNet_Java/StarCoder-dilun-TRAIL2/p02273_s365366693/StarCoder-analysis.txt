he variable n is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it checks if n is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it initializes 3 Point2D variables s, t and u.
It calculates the value of variable th with the formula (Math.PI / 180) * 60.
It calculates the value of variable s by calculating the average of the x and y coordinates of a and b.
It calculates the value of variable t by calculating the average of the x and y coordinates of a and b.
It calculates the value of variable u by calculating the value of variable t by calculating the average of the x and y coordinates of a and b.
It calls the method curve recursively with n-1, a, s as parameters.
It prints the value of s.
It calls the method curve recursively with n-1, s, u as parameters.
It prints the value of u.
It calls the method curve recursively with n-1, u, t as parameters.
It prints the value of t.
It calls the method curve recursively with n-1, t, b as parameters.
