he variable n is initialized with 8.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of 8. The value of variable i is also passed to variable m.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of variable n. If it is, it calculates the value of variable m by dividing variable n by i and subtracting 1.
Then it checks if the current interger i is less than variable m. If it is, it adds the current interger m to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 1,2,4 and 8.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
