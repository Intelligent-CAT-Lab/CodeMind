he variable n is initialized with 8.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of 8. The value of variable i is also passed to variable m.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of variable n. If it is, it calculates the value of variable m by dividing variable n by i and subtracting 1.
Then it checks if the current interger i is less than variable m. If it is, it adds the current interger m to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 1,2,4 and 8.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        long n = Long.parseLong(br.readLine());
        long ans = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
           if(n % i == 0) {
               long m = n / i - 1;
               if(i < m) ans += m;
           }
        }

        System.out.println(ans);
        
        br.close();

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of 10. The value of variable i is also passed to variable m.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of variable n. If it is, it calculates the value of variable m by dividing variable n by i and subtracting 1.
Then it checks if the current interger i
