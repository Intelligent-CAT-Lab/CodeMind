he variable n is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable num.
Inside the third for loop, it calculates the GCD of the three integers i, j and k by calling the function get_GCD(i,j,k).
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 12.
