he variable s is initialized with the input string "BBBWW".
The variable c is initialized with the first character of the string s, which is 'B'.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string s is not equal to the current character of the string s. If it is not, it adds 1 to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		int sum=0;
		for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
			if(n%i==0){
				sum+=i;
			}
		}
		System.out.print(sum);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer 10.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the value of variable n. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable n is divisible by the current interger i. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 23.
<<<Output>>>
23
