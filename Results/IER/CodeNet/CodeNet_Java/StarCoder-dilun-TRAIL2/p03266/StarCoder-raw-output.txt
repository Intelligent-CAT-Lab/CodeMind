he variable N is initialized with 3 and variable K is initialized with 2.
The code checks if K is even or odd. If it is even, it calculates the number of cubes of size K that can be placed in the cuboid of size N.
If K is odd, it calculates the number of cubes of size K/2 that can be placed in the cuboid of size N.
Then it calculates the number of cubes of size K/2 that can be placed in the remaining cuboid of size N.
The final output is the sum of the three numbers calculated above.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main (String[] args) {

    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    int N = sc.nextInt();
    int K = sc.nextInt();

    sc.close();

    if (K % 2 == 0) {
      long c1 = N / K;
      long c2 = N / (K / 2) - c1;
      System.out.println(c1 * c1 * c1 + c2 * c2 * c2);
    } else {
      long c = N / K;
      System.out.println(c * c * c);
    }

  }

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 and variable K is initialized with 3.
The code checks if K is even or odd. If it is even, it calculates the number of cubes of size K that can be placed in the cuboid of size N.
If K is odd, it calculates the number of cubes of size K/2 that can be placed in the cuboid of size N.
Then it calculates the number of cubes of size K/2 that can be placed in the remaining cuboid of size N.
The final output is the sum of the three numbers calculated above.
