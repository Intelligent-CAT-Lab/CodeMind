he variable N is initialized with 3 and variable K is initialized with 2.
The code checks if K is even or odd. If it is even, it calculates the number of cubes of size K that can be placed in the cuboid of size N.
If K is odd, it calculates the number of cubes of size K/2 that can be placed in the cuboid of size N.
Then it calculates the number of cubes of size K/2 that can be placed in the remaining cuboid of size N.
The final output is the sum of the three numbers calculated above.
