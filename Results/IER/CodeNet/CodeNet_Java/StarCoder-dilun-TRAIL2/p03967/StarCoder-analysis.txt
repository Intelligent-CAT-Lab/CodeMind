he variable top is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string top.
Inside the for loop, it checks if variable cpp is true. If it is true, it checks if the character at index j of the string top is 'g'. If it is, it increments variable score by 1.
If variable cpp is false, it checks if the character at index j of the string top is 'p'. If it is, it decrements variable score by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable score as output, which is 0.
