he variable top is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string top.
Inside the for loop, it checks if variable cpp is true. If it is true, it checks if the character at index j of the string top is 'g'. If it is, it increments variable score by 1.
If variable cpp is false, it checks if the character at index j of the string top is 'p'. If it is, it decrements variable score by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable score as output, which is 0.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String top = r.readLine();
		int score = 0;
		for (int j = 0; j < top.length(); j++) {
			if (top.charAt(j) == 'p')
				score--;
			else if (top.charAt(j) == 'g')
				score++;
		}
		System.out.println(score);
	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```gpg
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
