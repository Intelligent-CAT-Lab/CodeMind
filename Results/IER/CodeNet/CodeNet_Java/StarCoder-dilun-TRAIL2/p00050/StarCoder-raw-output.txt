he variable str is initialized with the input.
The variable ans is initialized with the value of variable str.
The replace method is called on variable ans to replace the word "apple" with "wwwp".
The replace method is called on variable ans to replace the word "peach" with "wwwa".
The replace method is called on variable ans to replace the word "wwwp" with "peach".
The replace method is called on variable ans to replace the word "wwwa" with "apple".
After the replace method is called, the value of variable ans is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one wwwp is higher than that of one wwwa.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		  try(Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
			  String str=sc.nextLine();
			  String ans=str.replace("apple", "wwwp");
			  ans=ans.replace("peach", "wwwa");
			  ans=ans.replace("wwwp", "peach");
			  ans=ans.replace("wwwa", "apple");
			  System.out.println(ans);
		  }
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple.
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized with the input.
The variable ans is initialized with the value of variable str.
The replace method is called on variable ans to replace the word "apple" with "wwwp".
The replace method is called on variable ans to replace the word "peach" with "wwwa".
The replace method is called on variable ans to replace the word "wwwp" with "peach".
The replace method is called on variable ans to replace the word "wwwa" with "apple".
After the replace method is called, the value of variable ans is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one wwwp is higher than that of one wwwa.
