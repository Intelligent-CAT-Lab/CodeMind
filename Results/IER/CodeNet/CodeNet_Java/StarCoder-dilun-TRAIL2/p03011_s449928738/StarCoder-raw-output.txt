he variable X is initialized with 3 integers.
The first integer is read from the keyboard and stored in the first element of the array X.
The second integer is read from the keyboard and stored in the second element of the array X.
The third integer is read from the keyboard and stored in the third element of the array X.
The array X is sorted in ascending order.
The sum of the first two elements of the array X is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in); 
		
		int[] X = new int[3];
		
		X[0] = keyboard.nextInt();
		X[1] = keyboard.nextInt();
		X[2] = keyboard.nextInt();
		
		Arrays.sort(X);
		
		System.out.println(X[0]+ X[1]);
		keyboard.close();	
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
