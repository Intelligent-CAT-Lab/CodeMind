he variable T, variable R and variable Y are initialized with 1, 6 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable A is initialized with the maximum of T, R and Y. The variable B is initialized with the minimum of T, R and Y.
The difference of A and B is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input.
The array arr is initialized with 5 elements.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current interger i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
