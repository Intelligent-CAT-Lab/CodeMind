e variable S is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 16 to check each character i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character i in the string S is equal to the corresponding character i in the string correct. If it is not, it increments variable num by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable num as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner input  = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = input.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[N];
		for(int i = 0; i < N;i++){
			arr[i] = input.nextInt();
		}
		input.close();
		int max = arr[0];
		for(int i = 1; i < N;i++){
			if(arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
		}
		System.out.println(max);
	}

}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the input integer.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it initializes an array of size N with all elements initialized with 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
