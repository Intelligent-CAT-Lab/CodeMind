he variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is less than or equal to 0 and b is greater than or equal to 0. If both conditions are met, it prints "Zero".
If a is greater than or equal to -1 and b is less than or equal to 0, it calculates the difference between the two numbers and checks if the difference is odd or even. If it is odd, it prints "Positive". Otherwise, it prints "Negative".
<<<Output>>>
Zero

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	static Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a=s.nextInt(),b=s.nextInt();
		if(a<=0&&0<=b)
			System.out.println("Zero");
		else
			System.out.println((Math.min(0,b)-Math.min(-1,a))%2==1?"Positive":"Negative");
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-1 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
