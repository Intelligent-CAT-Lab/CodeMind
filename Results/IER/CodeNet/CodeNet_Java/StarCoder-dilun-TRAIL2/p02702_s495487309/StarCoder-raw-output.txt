variable c is initialized with the input.
The variable n is initialized with the length of the input.
The variable d is initialized with an array of length n + 1.
The variable cur is initialized with 1.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The variable f is initialized with an array of length 2019.
The first element of the array f is initialized with 1.
The for loop iterates from n - 1 to 0.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable d[i] by multiplying the current character of the input with variable cur and adding the value of d[i + 1].
Then it calculates the value of variable cur by multiplying it by 10.
Then it calculates the value of variable d[i] by taking the remainder of variable d[i] divided by 2019.
Then it calculates the value of variable cur by taking the remainder of variable cur divided by 2019.
Then it adds the value of variable f[d[i]] to variable ans.
Then it increments the value of variable f[d[i]] by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
