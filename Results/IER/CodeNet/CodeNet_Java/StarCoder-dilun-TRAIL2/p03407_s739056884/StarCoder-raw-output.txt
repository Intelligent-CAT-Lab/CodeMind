he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 50, 100 and 120 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to c. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		if (a + b >= c) {
			System.out.println("Yes");
		}else {
			System.out.println("No");
		}
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```50 100 120
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
