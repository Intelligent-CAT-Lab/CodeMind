he variable N is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 5 to 1 to check each integer N in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger N with variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		//input
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		//calculation
		Long ans = 1L;
		for(Long N = sc.nextLong();N>1;N--){
			ans *= N;
		}
		//output
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 10 to 1 to check each integer N in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger N with variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3628800.
<<<Output>>>
