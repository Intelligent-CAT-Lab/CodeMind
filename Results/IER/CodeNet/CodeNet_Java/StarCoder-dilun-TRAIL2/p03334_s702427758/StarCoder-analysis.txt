NO-ANSWER
he variable n is initialized with 2.
The variable d1 and variable d2 are initialized with 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable map is initialized with 2*n rows and 2*n columns.
The variable dx is initialized with {1, 1, -1, -1}.
The variable dy is initialized with {1, -1, 1, -1}.
The variable sqrToseed is initialized with a HashMap with keys from 1 to 200000 and values from 1 to 200000.
The variable d1xy is initialized with an empty ArrayList.
The variable d2xy is initialized with an empty ArrayList.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 200000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable entry.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the HashMap sqrToseed contains the key d1 - entry.getKey(). If it does, it adds the value of entry.getValue() multiplied by 1000000 plus the value of sqrToseed.get(d1-entry.getKey()) to the variable d1xy.
Similarly, it checks if the HashMap sqrToseed contains the key d2 - entry.getKey(). If it does, it adds the value of entry.getValue() multiplied by 1000000 plus the value of sqrToseed.get(d2-entry.getKey()) to the variable d2xy.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 2*n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable i.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 2*n-1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable map at row i and column j is 0. If it is, it calls the function dfs with the parameters i, j, 0, true, d1xy.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 2*n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable i.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 2*n
