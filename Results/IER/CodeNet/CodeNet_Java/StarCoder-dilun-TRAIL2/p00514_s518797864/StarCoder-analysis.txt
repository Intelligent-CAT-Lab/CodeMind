he variable n, variable m and variable r are initialized with 2, 0 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the variable r is less than 0. If it is, it prints 0 as output and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes variable ans with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the variable ans and the difference of the variable r and the sum of the current interger i and n-1.
Then it divides the product of the variable ans and the difference of the variable r and the sum of the current interger i and n-1 by the sum of the current interger i and 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
