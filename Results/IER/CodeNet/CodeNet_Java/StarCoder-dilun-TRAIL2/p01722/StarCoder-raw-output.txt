he variable n is initialized with 0 according to the input.
It enters a switch statement and checks if the value of variable n is 0, 1 or 2.
If it is 0, it prints 1 as output.
If it is 1, it prints 2 as output.
If it is 2, it prints 1 as output.
If it is not 0, 1 or 2, it prints 0 as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		if (n == 0) {
			System.out.println(1);
		} else if (n == 1) {
			System.out.println(2);
		} else if (n == 2) {
			System.out.println(1);
		} else {
			System.out.println(0);
		}
		sc.close();
	}

}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 0 according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable n is 0.
If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If it is not 0, it checks if the value of variable n is 1.
If it is, it prints 2 as output.
If it is not 1, it checks if the value of variable n is 2.
If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If it is not 2, it prints 0 as output.
