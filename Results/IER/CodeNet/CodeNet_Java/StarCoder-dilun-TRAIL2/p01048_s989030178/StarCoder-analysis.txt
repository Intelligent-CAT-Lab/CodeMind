he variable N is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to infinity to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it increments variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the calculated variable count is equal to the value of variable N. If it is, it prints the current interger i as output.
