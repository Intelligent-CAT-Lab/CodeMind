he variable N is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to infinity to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it increments variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the calculated variable count is equal to the value of variable N. If it is, it prints the current interger i as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N;
		N = sc.nextInt();
		int count = 0;
		for (int i = 1;; ++i) {
			for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {
				if (i % j == 0) {
					count++;
				}
			}
			if (count == N) {
				System.out.println(i);
				break;
			}
			count = 0;
		}
		sc.close();
	}
}


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to infinity to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it increments variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the calculated variable count is equal to the value of variable N. If it is, it prints the current interger i as output.
