he variable n is initialized with 25.
It enters a while loop and it iterates while n is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable i by adding 1 to it and then dividing it by 3.
Then it calculates the value of variable n by subtracting the value of variable i from it.
After the loop finishes, it enters another while loop and it iterates while variable i is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks the value of variable a[i] and prints it.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable n as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;
// 0307
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt(),a[]=new int[15],i=0;
        while(n>0) {
            a[i++]=(n+1)%3-1;
            n=(n-a[i-1])/3;
        }
        while(i-->0)
            System.out.print((a[i]==0?"0":a[i]>0?"+":"-")+(i==0?"\n":""));
    }

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 12.
It enters a while loop and it iterates while n is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable i by adding 1 to it and then dividing it by 3.
Then it calculates the value of variable n by subtracting the value of variable i from it.
After the loop finishes, it enters another while loop and it iterates while variable i is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks the value of variable a[i] and prints it.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final
