he variable n is initialized with 25.
It enters a while loop and it iterates while n is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable i by adding 1 to it and then dividing it by 3.
Then it calculates the value of variable n by subtracting the value of variable i from it.
After the loop finishes, it enters another while loop and it iterates while variable i is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks the value of variable a[i] and prints it.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable n as output, which is 0.
