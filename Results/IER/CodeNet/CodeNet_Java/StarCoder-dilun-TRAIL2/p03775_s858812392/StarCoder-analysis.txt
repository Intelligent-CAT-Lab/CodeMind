e variable N is initialized with 10000.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of variable N.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of variable N. If it is not, it skips the current iteration and goes to the next iteration.
If the current interger i is a factor of variable N, it calculates the maximum of the number of digits of i and the number of digits of N/i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 4.
