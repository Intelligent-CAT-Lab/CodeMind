e variable N is initialized with 10000.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of variable N.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is a factor of variable N. If it is not, it skips the current iteration and goes to the next iteration.
If the current interger i is a factor of variable N, it calculates the maximum of the number of digits of i and the number of digits of N/i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int N = sc.nextInt();
    int[] arr = new int[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
    }
    int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++) {
        int tmp = Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[j]);
        if (tmp < min) {
          min = tmp;
        }
      }
    }
    System.out.println(min);
  }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the absolute value of the difference between the current interger i and the next interger j.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
