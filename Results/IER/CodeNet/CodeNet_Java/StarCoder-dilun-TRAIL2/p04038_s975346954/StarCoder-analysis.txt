he variable N is initialized with 2 and variable K is initialized with 2.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable dp[i][j] by adding the values of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1]*comb(i+j*(K-1)-1, K-2).
The value of dp[i][j] is calculated for all possible values of i and j.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints the final value of dp[2][2] as output, which is 1.
