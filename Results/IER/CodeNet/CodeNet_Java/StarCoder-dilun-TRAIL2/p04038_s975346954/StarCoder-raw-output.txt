he variable N is initialized with 2 and variable K is initialized with 2.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable dp[i][j] by adding the values of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1]*comb(i+j*(K-1)-1, K-2).
The value of dp[i][j] is calculated for all possible values of i and j.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints the final value of dp[2][2] as output, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N = sc.nextInt();
		int K = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[N];
		for(int i=0; i<N; i++)
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		int[] dp = new int[N];
		dp[0] = 1;
		for(int i=1; i<N; i++) {
			int max = 0;
			for(int j=0; j<i; j++) {
				if(arr[j] < arr[i])
					max = Math.max(max, dp[j]);
			}
			dp[i] = max+1;
		}
		System.out.println(dp[N-1]);
		sc.close();
	}

}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 and variable K is initialized with 3.
The code enters a
