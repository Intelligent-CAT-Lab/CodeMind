he variable arr is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character c in the array arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the variable beforeC is true. If it is true, it checks if the current character c is 'C'. If it is, it sets the variable beforeC to false.
If the variable beforeC is false, it checks if the current character c is 'F'. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output and returns.
If the variable beforeC is false and the current character c is not 'F', it continues to the next character c.
After the loop finishes, it prints "No" as output.
