he variable arr is initialized with the input string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character c in the array arr.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the variable beforeC is true. If it is true, it checks if the current character c is 'C'. If it is, it sets the variable beforeC to false.
If the variable beforeC is false, it checks if the current character c is 'F'. If it is, it prints "Yes" as output and returns.
If the variable beforeC is false and the current character c is not 'F', it continues to the next character c.
After the loop finishes, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max = arr[0];
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			if (arr[i] > max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max);
	}
}

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is greater than the current maximum value of the array arr. If it is, it updates the current maximum value of the array
