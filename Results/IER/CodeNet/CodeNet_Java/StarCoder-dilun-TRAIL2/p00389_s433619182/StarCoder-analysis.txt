he variable count is initialized with 4 and variable strength is initialized with 2.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the variable count is greater than or equal to the calculated value of (total + strength - 1) / strength.
If it is, it increases the value of variable size by 1 and increases the value of variable total by the calculated value of (total + strength - 1) / strength.
Then it decreases the value of variable count by the calculated value of (total + strength - 1) / strength.
The condition is met when count is 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable size as output, which is 2.
