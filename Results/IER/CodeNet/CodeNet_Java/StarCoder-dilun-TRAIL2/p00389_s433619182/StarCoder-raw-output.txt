he variable count is initialized with 4 and variable strength is initialized with 2.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the variable count is greater than or equal to the calculated value of (total + strength - 1) / strength.
If it is, it increases the value of variable size by 1 and increases the value of variable total by the calculated value of (total + strength - 1) / strength.
Then it decreases the value of variable count by the calculated value of (total + strength - 1) / strength.
The condition is met when count is 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable size as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int max = arr[0];
		int min = arr[0];
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
			if (arr[i] > max) {
				max = arr[i];
			}
			if (arr[i] < min) {
				min = arr[i];
			}
		}
		System.out.println(max - min);
	}
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum value of the current interger arr[i] and the minimum value of the
