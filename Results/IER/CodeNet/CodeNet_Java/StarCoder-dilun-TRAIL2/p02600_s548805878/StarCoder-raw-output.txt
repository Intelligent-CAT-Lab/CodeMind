he variable t is initialized with 725 according to the input.
It checks if the value of variable t is greater than or equal to 1800. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If it is not, it checks if the value of variable t is greater than or equal to 1600. If it is, it prints 2 as output.
If it is not, it checks if the value of variable t is greater than or equal to 1400. If it is, it prints 3 as output.
If it is not, it checks if the value of variable t is greater than or equal to 1200. If it is, it prints 4 as output.
If it is not, it checks if the value of variable t is greater than or equal to 1000. If it is, it prints 5 as output.
If it is not, it checks if the value of variable t is greater than or equal to 800. If it is, it prints 6 as output.
If it is not, it checks if the value of variable t is greater than or equal to 600. If it is, it prints 7 as output.
If it is not, it prints 8 as output.
