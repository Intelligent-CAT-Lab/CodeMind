he variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the condition is met.
Inside the while loop, it calls the nextPrime() method of the Prime class to get the next prime number.
Then it checks if the current prime number is divisible by 5. If it is, it prints the current prime number and increases the value of variable count by 1.
If the value of variable count is equal to the value of variable n, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 5.
