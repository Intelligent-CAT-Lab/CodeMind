he variable num is initialized with 3, 8 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ind.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is greater than the variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max and variable ind.
After the loop finishes, it checks if variable ind is not equal to 2. If it is, it swaps the values of the variables num[2] and num[ind].
Then it checks if the value of num[0] is greater than the value of num[1]. If it is, it swaps the values of the variables num[0] and num[1].
After the checks, it prints the final values of the variables num[0], num[1] and num[2] as output, which is 1 3 8.
