he variable A and variable B are initialized with 18 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable L is initialized with the maximum of A - B and 2.
The variable H is initialized with A + B.
The variable primes is initialized with the list of all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of H + 1.
The variable count is initialized with an array of length H - L + 1.
The variable ok is initialized with an array of length H - L + 1.
The variable ret is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the size of the list of prime numbers to 0.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable div by dividing L + (p - 1) by p.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the value of variable div multiplied by p to H.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable cc by initializing it with 1.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable v is not divisible by p.
Inside the while loop, it increments the value of variable cc by 1.
It divides the value of variable v by p.
It checks if the value of variable count at index (pos - L) is greater than the value of variable cc. If it is, it sets the value of variable ok at index (pos - L) to false.
It sets the value of variable count at index (pos - L) to the value of variable cc.
It checks if the value of variable ok at index (pos - L) is true. If it is, it increments the value of variable ret by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ret as output, which is 10.
