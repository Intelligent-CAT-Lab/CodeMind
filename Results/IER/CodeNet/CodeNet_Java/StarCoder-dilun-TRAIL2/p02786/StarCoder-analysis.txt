e variable h is initialized with 2.
The code checks if h is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If h is not equal to 1, it enters a while loop and it iterates until h is equal to 1.
Inside the while loop, it divides h by 2 and adds the result to variable sum.
It also increments the value of variable count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable sum plus 1 as output, which is 3.
