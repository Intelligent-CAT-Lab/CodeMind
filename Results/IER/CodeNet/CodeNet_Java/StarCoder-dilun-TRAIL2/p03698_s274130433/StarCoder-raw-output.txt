he variable c is initialized with the input string.
It sorts the array c in ascending order.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the array c. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the array c at index i-1 is equal to the current character of the array c at index i. If it is, it sets variable bl to false and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable bl as output, which is false.
<<<Output>>>
no

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int max = arr[0];
        for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > max) {
                max = arr[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input integer.
It creates an array of size n and initializes each element of the array with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current element of the array arr at index i is greater than the current maximum value of the array arr. If it is, it updates the current maximum value of the array arr with the current element of the array arr at index i.
After the loop finishes, it prints the current maximum value of the array arr as output, which is 5.
