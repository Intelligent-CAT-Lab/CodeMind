he variable c is initialized with the input string.
It sorts the array c in ascending order.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the array c. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the array c at index i-1 is equal to the current character of the array c at index i. If it is, it sets variable bl to false and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable bl as output, which is false.
