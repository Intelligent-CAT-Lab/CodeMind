he variable X and variable Y are initialized with 9 and 45000 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9-i+1 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable b.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i and k by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to variable Y. If it is, it sets the boolean variable judge to true and breaks out of the second for loop.
After the second for loop finishes, it checks if the boolean variable judge is true. If it is, it prints the values of variables a, b and c as output, which is 9 4 5.
If the boolean variable judge is false, it prints -1 -1 -1 as output.
<<<Output>>>
9 4 5

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		int X = sc.nextInt();
		int Y = sc.nextInt();

		int sum=0;
		boolean judge=false;
		int a=0;
		int b=0;
		int c=0;

		for (int i=0; i<X+1; i++) {
			for (int k=0; k<X-i+1; k++) {
				sum = 10000*i + 5000*k + 1000*(X-i-k);
				if (sum==Y) {
					judge = true;
					a=i;
					b=k;
					c=X-i-k;
