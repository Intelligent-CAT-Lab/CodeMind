variable strz is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable key.
Inside the for loop, it initializes a new array str with the same length as the input array strz.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the condition is met.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current array str contains only the same character as variable key. If it does, it calculates the number of times the character key appears in the array str.
If the number of times the character key appears in the array str is less than the current minimum value of variable min, it updates the value of variable min with the current number of times the character key appears in the array str.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 3.
