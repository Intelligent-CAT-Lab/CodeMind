  Explanation:

The code is using the Scanner class to read three long values from the user: a, b, and x. It then calculates the number of times x divides the range [a, b] by subtracting b/x from a/x and adding 1 if a%x is 0.

For the input 4 8 2, the range [a, b] is [4, 8], and x is 2. Therefore, the number of times x divides the range is (8/2) - (4/2) = 4 - 2 = 2. Since a%x is 0, the count is incremented by 1, so the final output is 3.

Final output:
3
