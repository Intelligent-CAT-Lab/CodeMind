  The output of the code would be:

90

Explanation:

The code reads an integer `n` from the input stream using the `saori_hayami()` method of the `hayami` class. The `saori_hayami()` method reads a single integer from the input stream and returns it.

In this case, the input is `90`, so the `n` variable is set to `90`.

The code then enters an infinite loop that increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. In each iteration, the code checks if `i*n` is divisible by 360. If it is, the code prints `i` and exits the loop.

Since `i*n` is not divisible by 360 for any value of `i`, the loop runs indefinitely. Therefore, the output of the code is just `90`.
