  Explanation:

The input is "1 1 2 2", which means that the first row and column have 1 black cell each, and the rest of the grid is empty.

The code calculates the number of ways to color the grid with the given constraints. The calculation is done using a dynamic programming approach, where the number of ways to color each cell is calculated based on the values of the neighboring cells.

The final output is the number of ways to color the entire grid, which is the value of the last cell in the grid (cell[C-1][D-1]).

Final output: 2

Explanation:

The grid has only one row and one column, and both of them have one black cell each. Therefore, the only possible way to color the grid is to color both cells black. Therefore, the final output is 2.
