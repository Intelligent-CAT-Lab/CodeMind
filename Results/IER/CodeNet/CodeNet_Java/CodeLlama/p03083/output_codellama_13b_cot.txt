  The output of the code would be:

1

Explanation:

The code is a solution to a problem on a programming contest. The problem statement is not provided, but based on the code, we can infer that the problem is related to combinatorics and number theory.

The code defines a function `C(n, r, mod, fif)` that calculates the binomial coefficient `n choose r` modulo `mod`. The function uses the Fast Inverse and Factorial (FIF) algorithm to calculate the binomial coefficient. The FIF algorithm is an efficient method for calculating binomial coefficients and factorials.

The code also defines a function `enumFIF(n, mod)` that calculates the FIF array for a given `n` and `mod`. The FIF array is an array of size `n+1` that contains the values of the binomial coefficients `n choose r` modulo `mod` for `r` from `0` to `n`.

The `solve()` function is the main function that solves the problem. It takes two integers `b` and `w` as input, and calculates the number of ways to choose `b` white balls and `w` black balls from a set of `b+w` balls. The code uses the FIF algorithm to calculate the binomial coefficients and the number of ways to choose the balls.

The code then prints the number of ways to choose the balls.

The input `2 1` means that there are 2 white balls and 1 black ball in the set. The output `1` means that there is only one way to choose 1 white ball and 1 black ball from the set.
