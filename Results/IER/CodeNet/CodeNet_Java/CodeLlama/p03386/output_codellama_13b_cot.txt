  Explanation:

The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and k. It then creates a TreeSet to store the numbers between a and b, inclusive, and adds them to the set. The set is then iterated over and the numbers are printed to the console.

The input given is 3 8 2, which means that the code should print the numbers between 3 and 8, inclusive, and the number of numbers to print is 2.

Final output:
3
8
