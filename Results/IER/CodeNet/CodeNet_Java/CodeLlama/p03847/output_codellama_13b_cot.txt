  The output of the code would be 2.

Explanation:

The code is solving a problem related to binary strings. It is using dynamic programming to count the number of binary strings of length 60 that have a certain property.

The input 3 is the number of bits in the binary string. The code is initializing an array of length 61 to store the binary string, with the last element being the most significant bit.

The code is then initializing a 2D array of size 61x3 to store the number of binary strings of length i that have a certain property. The first dimension of the array represents the length of the binary string, and the second dimension represents the number of consecutive 1s in the string.

The code is then iterating over the length of the binary string, starting from the most significant bit, and updating the number of binary strings that have a certain property.

The final output of the code is the number of binary strings of length 60 that have a certain property, which is stored in the variable ans. The output is 2, which is the number of binary strings of length 60 that have a certain property.
