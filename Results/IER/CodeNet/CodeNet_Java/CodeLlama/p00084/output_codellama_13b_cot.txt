  Explanation:

The code reads input from the user using a Scanner object, and then processes the input line by line. For each line, it replaces all occurrences of '.' with ',' and all occurrences of ',' with ' '. It then splits the line into tokens using the space character as a delimiter.

For each token, it checks if the length of the token is between 3 and 6, inclusive. If it is, it prints the first n characters of the token, where n is the length of the token. If there are multiple tokens that meet this criteria, they are printed separated by a space. Finally, the code prints a newline character after all the tokens have been processed.

Final output:
