  The output of the code would be 84.

Explanation:

The code iterates over the numbers from 1 to N (in this case, 1 to 20) and calculates the sum of the digits of each number. If the sum is between A and B (in this case, 2 and 5), the number is added to the total sum (ans).

Here's the calculation for each number:

* 1: 1 % 10 = 1, sum = 1
* 2: 2 % 10 = 2, sum = 3
* 3: 3 % 10 = 3, sum = 6
* 4: 4 % 10 = 4, sum = 10
* 5: 5 % 10 = 5, sum = 15
* 6: 6 % 10 = 6, sum = 21
* 7: 7 % 10 = 7, sum = 28
* 8: 8 % 10 = 8, sum = 36
* 9: 9 % 10 = 9, sum = 45
* 10: 10 % 10 = 0, sum = 45
* 11: 11 % 10 = 1, sum = 46
* 12: 12 % 10 = 2, sum = 48
* 13: 13 % 10 = 3, sum = 51
* 14: 14 % 10 = 4, sum = 55
* 15: 15 % 10 = 5, sum = 60
* 16: 16 % 10 = 6, sum = 66
* 17: 17 % 10 = 7, sum = 73
* 18: 18 % 10 = 8, sum = 81
* 19: 19 % 10 = 9, sum = 90
* 20: 20 % 10 = 0, sum = 90

The total sum is 84.
