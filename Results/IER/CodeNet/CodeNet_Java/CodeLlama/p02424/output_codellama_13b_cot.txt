  The output of the code execution given the input "8 10" would be:

1010
1010
1010

Explanation:

The code takes two long integers as input using the Scanner class. The first input is 8, and the second input is 10.

The code then calls the toString() method to convert the input integers to binary strings. The toString() method takes a long integer as input and returns a string representation of the binary number.

The toString() method works by repeatedly dividing the input integer by 2 and appending the remainder (i.e., the last digit) to a StringBuilder object. The StringBuilder object is then reversed and returned as a string.

In this case, the binary representation of 8 is 1000, and the binary representation of 10 is 1010. When the two binary numbers are bitwise ANDed (&), the result is 1000, which is the binary representation of 8. When the two binary numbers are bitwise ORed (|), the result is 1010, which is the binary representation of 10. When the two binary numbers are bitwise XORed (^), the result is also 1010, which is the binary representation of 10.

Therefore, the output of the code execution given the input "8 10" would be the binary representations of 8, 10, and 10, respectively.
