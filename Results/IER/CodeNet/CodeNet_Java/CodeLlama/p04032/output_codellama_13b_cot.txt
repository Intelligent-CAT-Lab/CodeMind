  The output of the code execution given the input "needed" would be:

-1 -1

Explanation:

The code reads the input line by line and splits each line into an array of characters. It then iterates over the array and checks if any two consecutive characters are the same. If they are, it sets the `resultNum1` and `resultNum2` variables to the indices of the two consecutive characters.

In the case of the input "needed", there are no consecutive characters that are the same, so the `resultNum1` and `resultNum2` variables are not set. Therefore, the output is -1 -1.
