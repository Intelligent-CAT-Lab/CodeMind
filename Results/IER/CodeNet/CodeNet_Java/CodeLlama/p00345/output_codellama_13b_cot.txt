  The output of the code execution given the input "0.(3)" would be "3/1".

Explanation:

The input "0.(3)" represents the fraction 0.3. The code first splits the input string into two parts using the "." character as a delimiter. The first part is "0" and the second part is "(3)".

The code then converts the first part "0" to an integer and stores it in the variable "an". The second part "(3)" is also converted to an integer and stored in the variable "bn".

The code then calculates the least common multiple (lcm) of the denominators of the two fractions, which is 10. The numerators of the two fractions are then multiplied by the lcm and added together to get the numerator of the resulting fraction. The denominator of the resulting fraction is also calculated as the lcm of the denominators of the two fractions.

Finally, the code prints the resulting fraction as "3/1".
