  Explanation:

The code reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two integers using the `split()` method, and then calculates the sum of the two integers.

The input "10 5" is given, so the code will read the line "10 5" and split it into two strings "10" and "5". It will then convert these strings to integers using the `parseInt()` method and add them together to get the sum 15.

Final output: 15
