  The output of the code would be 4.

Explanation:

The code first takes in three integers A, B, and K from the user. It then creates an array s of size A+B and initializes it with 0s.

The code then starts a while loop that iterates from 1 to the minimum of A and B. For each iteration, it checks if A and B are divisible by the current value of z. If they are, it adds the current value of z to the array s and increments y.

After the while loop, the code prints the value of s[y-K]. Since y-K is equal to 2 in this case, the code prints the value of s[2], which is 4.

Therefore, the output of the code would be 4.
