  Explanation:

The code is finding the number of integers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) that have a sum of digits equal to 16.

The code works by iterating from 1 to 1000 and calculating the sum of the digits of each number. If the sum of the digits is equal to 16, the code increments a counter.

The code uses the `Math.pow()` method to calculate the power of each number, and the `String.valueOf()` method to convert the number to a string. The `substring()` method is used to extract each digit of the number as a string, and the `Integer.parseInt()` method is used to convert each digit string to an integer.

Final output:

The output of the code would be 1, since the only number between 1 and 1000 that has a sum of digits equal to 16 is 16 itself.
