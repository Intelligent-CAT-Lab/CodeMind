  The output of the code execution given the input "10 20 5" would be "100".

Explanation:

1. The first two numbers "10" and "20" are read into the variables W and H, respectively.
2. The third number "5" is read into the variable C.
3. The function gcd(W, H) is called to calculate the greatest common divisor of W and H. Since W and H are both even numbers, the gcd is 2.
4. The variable WH is assigned the value 2.
5. The variable a is calculated as (W/WH) \* (H/WH), which is (10/2) \* (20/2) = 50.
6. The final output is calculated as a \* C, which is 50 \* 5 = 10
