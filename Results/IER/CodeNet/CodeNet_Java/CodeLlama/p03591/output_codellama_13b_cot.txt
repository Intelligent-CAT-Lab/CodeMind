  The output of the code execution given the input "YAKINIKU" would be "Yes".

Explanation:

1. The code creates a `Scanner` object `sc` to read input from the console.
2. The code reads a `String` from the console using `sc.next()`.
3. The code checks the length of the `String` using `s.length()`. If the length is less than 4, the code prints "No" and returns.
4. The code creates a new `String` `s2` by taking the first 4 characters of `s` using `s.substring(0, 4)`.
5. The code checks if `s2` is equal to "YAKI" using `s2.equals("YAKI")`. If it is, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

In this case, the input "YAKINIKU" has a length of 8, which is greater than 4. The first 4 characters of "YAKINIKU" are "YAKI", so the code prints "Yes".
