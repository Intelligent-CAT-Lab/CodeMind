  The output of the code would be:

10

Explanation:

The code takes an integer input from the user and then calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to the input number. The code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers less than or equal to the input number. The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm works by iteratively marking as composite (not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the prime number 2. The code then prints the number of prime numbers less than or equal to the input number.

In this case, the input number is 10, and the number of prime numbers less than or equal to 10 is 4 (2, 3, 5, and 7). Therefore, the output of the code would be 10.
