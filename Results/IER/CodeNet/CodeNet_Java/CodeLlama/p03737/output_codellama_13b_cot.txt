  Explanation:

The code uses a `Scanner` object to read input from the user. The `next()` method is used to read the next token from the input, which is a string. The `charAt(0)` method is used to get the first character of the string, which is then converted to uppercase using the `Character.toUpperCase()` method.

The `for` loop iterates 3 times, so the code will read and print the first 3 characters of the input string.

Final output:

The final output of the code would be "ABC".
