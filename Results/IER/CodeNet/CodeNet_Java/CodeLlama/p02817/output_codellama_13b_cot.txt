  Explanation:

The code reads two strings from the user input using the `Scanner` class. The first string is stored in the variable `string`, and the second string is stored in the variable `tString`. The code then concatenates the two strings and prints the result.

Final Output:

oder atc

The output is the concatenation of the two strings, "oder" and "atc", which is "oder atc".
