  The output of the code execution given the input "4 11" would be "x".

Explanation:

The code reads two integers from the user using the Scanner class. The first integer is stored in the variable "a" and the second integer is stored in the variable "b".

The code then checks if the sum of "a" and "b" is equal to 15. Since 4 + 11 = 15, the first condition is true and the code prints "+".

However, since the second condition (a*b==15) is false, the code does not print "*". Instead, it prints "x" because the else block is executed.

Therefore, the final output of the code execution given the input "4 11" is "x".
