  Explanation:

The code takes an integer input from the user using the `Scanner` class and stores it in the variable `a`. It then prints the value of `a`, the square of `a`, and the cube of `a`.

Final Output:

The output of the code would be:

2
4
8

Explanation:

* The value of `a` is 2.
* The square of `a` is 2^2 = 4.
* The cube of `a` is 2^3 = 8.

Therefore, the output of the code would be 2, 4, and 8.
