  Explanation:

The code takes two integers as input, N and K, and calculates the number of ways to divide N objects into K groups. The code uses a simple formula to calculate the number of ways to divide N objects into K groups:

c = N / K

where c is the number of ways to divide N objects into K groups.

The code then prints the result to the console.

Final Output:

The final output of the code would be 1, which is the number of ways to divide 3 objects into 2 groups.
