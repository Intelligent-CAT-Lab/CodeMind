  The output of the code would be "Yes".

Explanation:
The code iterates over the range of values from 0 to N (in this case, 2) and for each value of i, it iterates over the range of values from 0 to M (in this case, 2) and for each value of j, it calculates the sum of the digits of the number i * j. If the sum is equal to K (in this case, 2), it prints "Yes" and exits the program.

In this case, the code will iterate over the following pairs of values:

* i = 0, j = 0: sum = 0
* i = 0, j = 1: sum = 1
* i = 0, j = 2: sum = 2
* i = 1, j = 0: sum = 0
* i = 1, j = 1: sum = 1
* i = 1, j = 2: sum = 2
* i = 2, j = 0: sum = 0
* i = 2, j = 1: sum = 1
* i = 2, j = 2: sum = 2

Since the sum of the digits of 2 * 2 is 2, the code will print "Yes" and exit the program.

Final output:
Yes
