  Explanation:

The code takes two integers as input: `n` and `r`. It then checks if `n` is less than 10, and if it is, it prints `r + (10 - n) * 100`. If `n` is not less than 10, it simply prints `r`.

Final output:

The output of the code for the given input `2 2919` would be `2919`.

Explanation:

The input `2 2919` means that `n = 2` and `r = 2919`. Since `n` is not less than 10, the code simply prints `r`, which is `2919`.
