  The output of the code would be 12.

Explanation:

The code first takes an integer input `n` from the user. It then creates a 2D array `array` of size 10x10, where each element is initialized to 0.

The code then loops through the numbers from 1 to `n` and for each number `i`, it calculates the head and tail digits of `i` using the `substring` method. The head digit is the first digit of `i`, and the tail digit is the last digit of `i`.

The code then increments the value of `array[head][tail]` by 1 for each number `i`.

The code then calculates the sum of the elements in the first row of `array` and prints the result.

In this case, the input `n` is 25, and the first row of `array` would be:
```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
The sum of the elements in the first row is 0, so the output would be 0.

Final output: 0
