  The output of the code would be "AAtC".

Explanation:

1. The code reads a line of input from the user using the `Scanner` class.
2. The line is split into an array of strings using the `split()` method, with each word separated by a space.
3. The second word in the array (index 1) is accessed using the `lines[1]` syntax.
4. The first character of the second word is accessed using the `charAt()` method, which returns the character at the specified index.
5. The character is then printed to the console using the `System.out.println()` method.

Therefore, the output of the code would be "AAtC", which is the first letter of the second word in the input line, followed by the first letter of the third word, and then the letter "C".
