The given Java code is a solution for a problem related to modular arithmetic and combinatorics. The problem involves calculating the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements, where the elements are distinct and each element has a certain value. The values of the elements are modulo m.

The code reads three integers n, m, and k from the input. The code then calculates the answer to the problem using the formula for combinations modulo m, which is (n choose k) mod m. The formula for combinations is nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = n
