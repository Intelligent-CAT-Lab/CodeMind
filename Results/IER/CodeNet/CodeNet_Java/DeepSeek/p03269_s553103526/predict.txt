The provided Java code is a solution for a problem related to graph theory and bit manipulation. The code reads an integer input `l` and generates a graph where each node `i` has an edge to node `i+1` with cost `0` and to all nodes `j` such that `j > i+1` and `j <= 20` with cost `2^(20-j)`. The code then prints the number of nodes and edges in the graph, followed by the details of each edge.

The input `4` is used to generate a graph where the number of nodes is `20` and the number of edges is `21`. The details of each edge are printed in the format `"node_from node_to cost"`.

The output of the code would be:

```
20 21
1 2 0
1 3 0
1 4 0
1 5 0
2 3 1
2 4 2
2 5 4
3 4 3
3 5 7
4 5 5
5 6 1
5 7 2
5 8 4
5 9 8
5 10 16
5 11 32
5 12 64
5 13 128
5 14 256
5 15 512
5 16 1024
5 17 2048
5 18 4096
5 19 8192
5 20 16384
```

This output indicates that there are `20` nodes in the graph, and `21` edges. The edges are described by the format `"node_from node_to cost"`, where `node_from` is the node from which the edge originates, `node_to` is the node to which the edge leads, and `cost` is the cost of the edge.

Please note that the actual output may vary depending on the specific implementation of the code.

I hope this helps in understanding the output of the code execution.
