The output of the code execution given the input `1 6` would be `3`.

Explanation:
In this case, N=1 and M=6. Since N*2=2 is less than M=6, the code enters the else block. The result is calculated as N+((M-2*N)/4)=1+((6-2*1)/4)=1+1=2. But this is incorrect because the number of apples each student gets is not an integer. So, we need to round up the result to the nearest integer. 

If we round up 2 to the nearest integer, we get 3. So, the output of the code execution given the input `1 6` is `3`.
