The output of the code will depend on the input. If the input is 10, 30, and 20, the sum of these integers is 60. The discriminant is calculated as `(2 * 10 - 60) * (2 * 30 - 60) * (2 * 20 - 60)`, which equals -1200. Since the discriminant is not 0, the code will print "No", indicating that the three integers cannot form a Pythagorean triplet.
