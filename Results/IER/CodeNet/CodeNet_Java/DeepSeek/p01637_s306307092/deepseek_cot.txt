### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		long m = sc.nextLong();
		long rd = sc.nextLong();
		long rr = sc.nextLong();
		long cd = sc.nextLong();
		long cr = sc.nextLong();
		
		long d = (cd*100)/rd;
		while((d*rd)/100!=cd) d++;
		long r = (cr*100)/rr;
		while((r*rr)/100!=cr) r++;
		if(m-d-r<0) System.out.println(-1);
		else System.out.println(m-d-r);
	}

}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `M r`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in six inputs: m, rd, rr, cd, cr. 

m is the total amount of money. 
rd and rr are the rates at which the money is being earned and spent, respectively. 
cd and cr are the costs of the goods being bought and sold, respectively.

The code calculates the amount of money earned per day (d) and the amount of money spent per day (r) by multiplying the rates with 100 and dividing by 100. 

The code then checks if the remaining money after buying goods (m-d-r) is less than 0. If it is, it prints -1, indicating that it is not possible to buy goods with the remaining money. If it is not less than 0, it prints the remaining money.

The code uses a while loop to increment the values of d and r until they match the rates given as input. This is done to ensure that the rates are accurate to the nearest hundredth.

The code then calculates the remaining money after buying goods by subtracting the cost of goods bought (d) and the cost of goods sold (r) from the total money (m).

The remaining money is then printed as the output.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input values of m, rd, rr, cd, and cr. It will give the remaining money after buying goods, or -1 if it is not possible to buy goods with the remaining money.
