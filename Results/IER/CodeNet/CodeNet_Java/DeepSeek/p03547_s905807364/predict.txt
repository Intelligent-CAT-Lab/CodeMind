For the given code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		char A = sc.next().charAt(0);
		char B = sc.next().charAt(0);
		char ans = 0;
		if(A == B) {
			ans = '=';
		} else if(A > B) {
			ans = '>';
		} else if(A <B) {
			ans = '<';
		}
		System.out.println(ans);
	}
}
```

The input is two characters `A` and `B`. The code reads these characters from the standard input.

The analysis of the code is as follows:

1. It creates a `Scanner` object `sc` to read the input from the standard input.
2. It reads the first character from the input and assigns it to the variable `A`.
3. It reads the second character from the input and assigns it to the variable `B`.
4. It initializes a character variable `ans` with 0.
5. It checks if `A` is equal to `B`. If it is, it assigns `'='` to `ans`.
6. If `A` is not equal to `B`, it checks if `A` is greater than `B`. If it is, it assigns `'>'` to `ans`.
7. If `A` is not greater than `B`, it checks if `A` is less than `B`. If it is, it assigns `'<'` to `ans`.
8. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` to the standard output.

Given the input `A B`, the output of the code would be `<` because `A` is less than `B`.

So, the output of the code would be:

```
<
```
