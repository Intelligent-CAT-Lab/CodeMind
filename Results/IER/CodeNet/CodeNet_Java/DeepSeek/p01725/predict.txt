The given input `3-2*3` is a mathematical expression that needs to be evaluated. The expression is read from left to right, but since there are operators with higher precedence (multiplication `*`), the expression is evaluated according to the BODMAS rule (Brackets, Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction).

The code uses a stack-based approach to evaluate the expression. It first converts the infix expression to a postfix expression (also known as Reverse Polish Notation), and then evaluates the postfix expression.

The code uses a priority table (PRI) to determine the precedence of the operators. The priority table is initialized with the possible permutations of the operators (+, -, *). The priority of the operators in the expression is determined by the priority table.

The code uses a stack to store the operators and operands. The stack is used to convert the infix expression to a postfix expression. The stack is also used to evaluate the postfix expression.

The code uses a list to store the postfix expression. The list is used to store the operands and the operators of the expression.

The code uses a for loop to iterate over the priority table. The code evaluates the expression for each permutation of the operators. The maximum value of the evaluated expressions is stored in the variable `max`.

The code uses the `eval` function to evaluate the postfix expression. The function uses a stack to store the operands. The function evaluates the postfix expression by popping operands from the stack and applying the operators to the operands. The result of the evaluation is stored in the stack. The function returns the top element of the stack as the result of the evaluation.

The code uses the `postfix` function to convert the infix expression to a postfix expression. The function uses a stack to store the operators. The function converts the infix expression to a postfix expression by popping operators from the stack and pushing them to the list. The function returns the list as the postfix expression.

The code uses the `parseInt` function to convert the string to an integer. The function is used to convert the string to an integer.

The code uses the `readLine` function to read the input from the user. The function is used to read the input from the user.

The code uses the `System.out.println` function to print the result of the evaluation. The function is used to print the result of the evaluation.
