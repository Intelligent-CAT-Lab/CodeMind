### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = scan.next();
		char[] c = new char[s.length()];
		for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
			c[i] = s.charAt(i);
		}
		int count = 0;
		for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
			if (c[i] != c[i-1]) {
				count++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `BBBWW`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `BBBWW` is given as input. The string contains two types of characters, 'B' and 'W'. The program counts the number of changes in the color from one character to another.

The program works by first reading the input string `s`. It then creates an array `c` of the same length as `s`. The program then iterates over the string `s`, character by character, and stores each character in the array `c`.

The program then initializes a variable `count` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the number of changes in color.

The program then enters a for loop that starts at index 1 and ends at the length of the string `s`. Inside this loop, the program checks if the current character `c[i]` is not equal to the previous character `c[i-1]`. If they are not equal, it means that a change in color has occurred, so the program increments `count` by 1.

Finally, the program prints the value of `count`, which represents the number of changes in color.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the program for the input `BBBWW` would be 1. This is because there is only one change in color from 'B' to 'W'.
