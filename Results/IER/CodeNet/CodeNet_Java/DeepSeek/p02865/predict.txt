The given Java code reads an integer input from the standard input and prints the integer minus one divided by two. The Reader class is used to read the input, and it has methods to read different types of inputs. The main method reads an integer N from the standard input, and then it prints (N - 1) / 2.

The Reader class has a method `i()` that reads an integer from the input. The main method uses this method to read the integer N.

The main method then calculates (N - 1) / 2 and prints the result. The calculation (N - 1) / 2 is performed using integer division, which discards the fractional part.

The Reader class also has a method `close()` that closes the input stream. The main method uses this method to close the input stream after it has finished reading the input.

The Reader class also has methods to read different types of arrays from the input. The main method does not use these methods, but they could be used in other parts of the program if necessary.

The main method catches any exceptions that are thrown while reading the input and closing the input stream. If an exception is thrown, the program prints the stack trace of the exception and exits.

The main method does not use any loops or conditionals in its calculations. It directly performs the calculations (N - 1) / 2 and prints the result.

The main method does not use any variables that are not local to the method. The only local variable is N, which is used to store the value read from the input.

The main method does not use any arrays or other data structures. It directly performs the calculations and prints the result.
