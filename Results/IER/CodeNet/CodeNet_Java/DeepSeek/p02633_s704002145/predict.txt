The provided Java code is a combination of various classes and methods, including a main class `Main`, a custom reader class `MyReader`, a combination class `Combination`, a tree class `Tree`, a graph class `Graph`, and a union-find class `UnionFind`. 

The main class `Main` contains a method `solve()` that reads an integer input from the user, calculates the number of 360 degrees divided by the input integer, and prints the result. 

The input integer is read using the `MyReader` class, which is a custom reader that reads input from the console. The `solve()` method in the `Main` class uses the `MyReader` class to read the input integer.

The `Combination` class is used to calculate combinations. The `Tree` class is used to represent a tree structure, and the `Graph` class is used to represent a graph structure. The `UnionFind` class is used to implement the union-find algorithm.

The provided code does not seem to contain any code that would directly process the input `90`. The `solve()` method in the `Main` class reads an integer input from the user, but this input is not provided in the question. 

Therefore, without the specific input `90`, it's impossible to provide an output for this code. If you provide the input `90`, the code will calculate the number of 360 degrees divided by 90 and print the result.

Please provide the input `90` for a more accurate analysis and output.
