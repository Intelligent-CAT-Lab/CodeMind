The given Java code is a solution for a problem where it is required to generate a graph with N nodes and K edges. The nodes are numbered from 1 to N. The graph should be a tree, i.e., it should not contain any cycles. The nodes should be connected, i.e., for every pair of nodes (i, j), there should be an edge between them.

The input to the program is two integers N and K. The program should print the number of edges M and M edges in the graph. If it is impossible to generate a graph with N nodes and K edges, the program should print -1.

The code uses a combination function to calculate the maximum number of edges that can be formed with N nodes. If K is greater than this maximum number, the program prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the number of edges M and prints it. Then it prints M edges of the graph.

The edges are printed in increasing order of their numbers. For each edge (i, j), i < j.

The code uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the combinations of nodes. The combination function calculates the number of ways to choose k nodes from n nodes.

The FastScanner class is a utility class that provides methods to read integers, long integers, and strings from the standard input.

The main method creates an instance of the Main class and calls the solve method. The solve method implements the logic of the problem.

The solve method first reads the input N and K. If N is 2, it checks if K is 0. If it is, it prints 1 and 1 2. If it is not, it prints -1. If N is not 2, it calculates the maximum number of edges that can be formed with N nodes. If K is greater than this maximum number, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the number of edges M and prints it. Then it prints M edges of the graph.

The make_comb_dp method initializes a dynamic programming table dp to calculate the combinations of nodes. The combination method calculates the number of ways to choose k nodes from n nodes using the dynamic programming table dp.

The solve method then prints M edges of the graph. For each edge (i, j), i < j, it prints i and j.

The main method then closes the output stream.
