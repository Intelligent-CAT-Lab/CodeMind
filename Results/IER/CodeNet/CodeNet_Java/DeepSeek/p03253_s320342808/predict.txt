The given Java code is a solution for a problem on HackerRank. The problem is about calculating the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements, where n and k are given as input. The code uses the concept of combinatorics and dynamic programming to solve this problem.

The input to the code is a single line containing two integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 1000000). The code reads this input and splits it into two separate integers.

The code then calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements using the combination formula: nCk = nPk / kPk. The calculation is done using the factorial of n and k, and the inverse of the factorial of k. The factorials and inverses are calculated using dynamic programming techniques.

The result of the calculation is then outputted to the console. The result is given modulo 1000000007 to prevent overflow.

The code uses a class named InputReader to read the input from the console. This class is used to read the input as integers, split it into separate integers, and return the integers as an array.

The code also uses a class named TaskX to solve the problem. This class contains a method named solve that takes the test number, the input reader, and the print writer as parameters. The solve method reads the input from the input reader, calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements, and outputs the result to the print writer.

The code also uses a class named Main to run the program. This class contains a main method that creates an instance of the TaskX class, calls the solve method with the appropriate parameters, and closes the print writer.
