The given Java code is a solution for a problem on AtCoder, a competitive programming platform. The problem is about finding the minimum number of digits that can be removed from a number to make it a perfect square.

The code takes an input number N and checks for each integer i from sqrt(N) to 1, if N is divisible by i. If it is, it means N can be divided into i and N/i. The length of these two numbers (i and N/i) are the lengths of the digits of the numbers. The code then finds the maximum of these lengths and prints it as the output.

In the given example, the input is 10000. The square root of 10000 is 100. So, the code checks if 10000 is divisible by 100, 99, 98, ..., 1. The first number that 10000 is divisible by is 100, so the code prints 2 as the output.

So, the output of the code execution given the input 10000 is 2.

The output can be verified by running the code with the input 10000.

Here is the code snippet:

```java
long N = 10000;
int sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(N);
for (int i = sqrt; i > 0; i--) {
    if (N % i == 0) {
        int A = Integer.toString(i).length();
        int B = Long.toString(N / i).length();
        System.out.println(Math.max(A, B));
        return;
    }
}
```

This code will print 2 when run with the input 10000.
