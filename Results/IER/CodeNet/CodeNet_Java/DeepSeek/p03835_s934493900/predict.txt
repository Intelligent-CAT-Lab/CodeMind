The output of the code execution given the input `2 2` would be 15.

The reason is that there are 15 ways to choose x, y, and z such that x, y, and z are non-negative integers, their sum is 2, and x, y, and z are all less than or equal to 2. These pairs are (0, 0, 2), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 0), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (2, 0, 0), (0, 0, 2), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 0), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (2, 0, 0), (0, 0, 2), and (0, 1, 1).
