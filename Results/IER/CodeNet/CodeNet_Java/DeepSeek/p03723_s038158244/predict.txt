The exact output of the code would depend on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` at each iteration of the loop. However, given the input `4 12 20`, the output of the code would be the number of iterations it takes for the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` to become equal, or `-1` if they never become equal.
