The provided Java code is a collection of utility functions that perform various operations such as calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd), least common multiple (lcm), finding the maximum and minimum of two numbers, calculating the factorial of a number, finding the lower and upper bounds in an array, checking if a number is prime, calculating the upper division of two numbers, finding the maximum and minimum of two long numbers, setting an array, reversing a string, and checking if a string contains "keyence".

The code is designed to take an input string and check if it contains "keyence" by removing one character at a time from the beginning and end of the string and checking if the remaining string is "keyence". If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

Given the input `keyofscience`, the code will check if this string contains "keyence" by removing one character at a time from the beginning and end of the string and checking if the remaining string is "keyence".

The analysis of the code execution would be as follows:

1. The input string is `keyofscience`.
2. The code checks if the first character is 'k' and the last character is 'e'. If not, it checks if the string contains "keyence". If it does, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
3. If the first character is 'k' and the last character is 'e', the code will then check all possible combinations of removing one character from the beginning and end of the string and checking if the remaining string is "keyence".
4. If it finds a combination that results in "keyence", it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The output of the code execution would be "YES" because the string `keyofscience` can be reduced to "keyence" by removing the 'o' and 's' from the beginning and end of the string.

Here is the output:

```
YES
```

This output indicates that the string `keyofscience` can be reduced to "keyence" by removing the 'o' and 's' from the beginning and end of the string.
