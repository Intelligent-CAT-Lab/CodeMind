Given the input `2 3 3`, the code first checks if 3 is greater than or equal to 2. It is, so it subtracts the difference, 3-2, from 3, resulting in 1. It then sets 'a' to 0.

Next, it checks if 'b' (which is now 1) is less than 0. It is not, so it leaves 'b' as is.

Finally, it prints the final number of apples (0) and bananas (1). So the output would be `0 1`.
