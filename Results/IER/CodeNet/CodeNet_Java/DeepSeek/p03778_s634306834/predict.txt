Given the input `3 2 6`, the maximum difference is calculated as follows:

`a` is `2`, `b` is `6`, and `W` is `3`.

The maximum of `a` and `b` is `6`, and the minimum is `2`.

So, the difference is `6 - 2 = 4`.

We subtract `W` from this difference, which is `3`.

So, the result is `4 - 3 = 1`.

Therefore, the output of the code execution is `1`.
