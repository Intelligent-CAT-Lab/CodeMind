### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3 2 6`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Java code reads three integers from the input, assigns them to variables `W`, `a`, and `b` respectively. It then calculates the maximum difference between `a` and `b` and `W` and prints the result.

The `FastScanner` class is used to read the input. The `ni()` method reads an integer from the input. The `solve()` method calculates the maximum difference and prints the result.

The input `3 2 6` is assigned to `W`, `a`, and `b` respectively.

The calculation is done by the following line of code:
```java
out.println(Math.max(Math.max(a, b) - Math.min(a, b) - W, 0));
```
This line calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b` and subtracts `W`. If the result is negative, it prints `0`.

The maximum of `a` and `b` is calculated by `Math.max(a, b)` and the minimum is calculated by `Math.min(a, b)`.

The calculation is done by subtracting `W` from the difference. If the result is negative, it means that `W` is greater than the difference between `a` and `b`, so it prints `0`.

The maximum difference between `a` and `b` and `W` is then printed.

<<<Output>>>
Given the input `3 2 6`, the maximum difference is calculated as follows:

`a` is `2`, `b` is `6`, and `W` is `3`.

The maximum of `a` and `b` is `6`, and the minimum is `2`.

So, the difference is `6 - 2 = 4`.

We subtract `W` from this difference, which is `3`.

So, the result is `4 - 3 = 1`.

Therefore, the output of the code execution is `1`.
