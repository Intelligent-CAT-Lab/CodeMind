The output of the code will be the net amount of money earned from selling `n` units of product.

For example, if the input is `20`, the output will be `14000`.

This is because `20*800 = 16000` and `20/15*200 = 600`, so the net amount of money earned is `16000 - 600 = 15400`.

So, the output of the code for the input `20` is `15400`.
