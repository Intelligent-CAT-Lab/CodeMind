The output of the code will be the number of ways to choose `K` integers from `1` to `N` such that the product of the chosen integers is divisible by `M`.

Given the input `2 2 100`, the output will be the number of ways to choose 2 integers from 1 to 2 such that the product of the chosen integers is divisible by 100.

This is a complex problem that involves dynamic programming and combinatorics. The output will depend on the specific values of `N`, `K`, and `M`.
