The output of the code will be:

Yes
2
1 2
3 4 5

This means that 3 can be represented as the sum of 2 consecutive integers: 1 + 2 = 3 and 3 + 4 = 7. The first line "Yes" indicates that 3 can be represented as the sum of consecutive integers. The next two lines print the number of consecutive integers and their values.
