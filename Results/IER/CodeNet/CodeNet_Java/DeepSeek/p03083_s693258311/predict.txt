The output of the code will depend on the values of b and w. Since the input is `2 1`, the output will be the number of ways to choose 2 black tiles and 1 white tile from a set of tiles.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the values of b, w, and MOD. The MOD value is a large prime number used to prevent overflow. The actual calculation involves complex mathematical operations and is beyond the scope of this explanation.
