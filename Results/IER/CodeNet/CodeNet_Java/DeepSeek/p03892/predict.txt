The provided code is a Java program that reads four integers from the input and performs a series of operations on them. The specific operations performed depend on the nature of the integers.

The input provided is `1 1 3 4`.

Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The program reads four integers from the input using the `ni()` function. These integers are stored in variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` respectively.

2. The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two pairs of integers using the `gcd()` function. The GCD is calculated by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger one until the two numbers are equal.

3. The program then calculates the answer by subtracting 1 from the sum of the reciprocals of the GCDs of the pairs of integers.

4. Finally, the program prints the answer.

Given the input `1 1 3 4`, the program calculates the GCD of the pairs `(1, 1)` and `(3, 4)`, which are `1` and `1` respectively. The reciprocal of the GCDs are `1/1` and `1/1`, and their sum is `2`. Subtracting 1 from this gives `1`. So, the output of the program is `1`.

So, the output of the code execution given the input `1 1 3 4` is `1`.

Here is the output:

```
