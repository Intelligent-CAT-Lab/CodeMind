The output of the code will depend on the input values. If the center of the circle is within the rectangle, the output will be "Yes". Otherwise, the output will be "No".

For the input `5 4 2 2 1`, the center of the circle is at point (2,2) and the radius is 1. Since the center of the circle is within the rectangle (its left boundary is 1 and right boundary is 5, its top boundary is 1 and bottom boundary is 4), the output of the code will be "Yes".
