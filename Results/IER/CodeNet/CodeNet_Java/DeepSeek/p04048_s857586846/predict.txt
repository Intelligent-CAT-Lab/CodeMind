The given Java code is a solution for a problem where you are given two integers `n` and `x`. The task is to find the sum of `n` and the result of the function `f(n - x, x)`. The function `f(a, b)` is defined as follows:

- If `a > b`, swap `a` and `b`.
- If `b` is divisible by `a`, return `2*(b/a)*a - a`.
- Otherwise, return `2*(b/a)*a + f(a, b % a)`.

The input to the program is read from the standard input and the output is written to the standard output.

Given the input `5 2`, the output of the code would be `7`.

Here is the analysis:

- The input `5 2` is read by the `InputReader` class and assigned to the variables `n` and `x` respectively.
- The value of `n` is `5` and the value of `x` is `2`.
- The value of `n` is added to the result of the function `f(n - x, x)`.
- The function `f(n - x, x)` is calculated as follows:
  - `n - x` is `3` and `x` is `2`.
  - The function `f(a, b)` is called recursively with `a` as `2` and `b` as `3`.
