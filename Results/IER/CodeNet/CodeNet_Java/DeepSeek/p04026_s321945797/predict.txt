I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to execute Java code. However, I can help you understand how the code works and provide you with the expected output.

The provided Java code is a solution to a problem related to string manipulation and data structure usage. The code checks for a substring in a given string where the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the substring is equal to the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the rest of the string.

The input is a string of lowercase English letters. The code iterates over each character in the string, calculating the sum of ASCII values for each character. It then checks if there exists a substring in the string that has the same sum of ASCII values. If such a substring is found, the starting and ending indices of the substring are printed. If no such substring is found, "-1 -1" is printed.

The output of the code will depend on the input string. If the input string is "needed", the output will be "-1 -1" because there is no substring in "needed" that has the same sum of ASCII values as the rest of the string.

Here is the expected output:

```
-1 -1
```

I hope this helps you understand how the code works and what the output would be for the given input.
