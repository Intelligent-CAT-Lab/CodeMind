I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm unable to execute Java code. However, I can provide you with an analysis of the code you provided.

The Java code you provided is a solution for the problem "AOJ 1320: String" from the Japan At Coder. The problem is about finding the minimum length of a string that can be formed by concatenating several strings.

The code reads an integer N from the input, followed by N strings. It then checks if any of the strings in the input match each other. If a match is found, the string is marked as "equal" and not included in the final result.

The code then calculates the length of the shortest string that can be formed by concatenating the remaining strings. This is done by calculating the minimum length of the string that can be formed by concatenating each string with each other string.

The final result is the minimum length of the string that can be formed by concatenating the remaining strings.

The output of the code will depend on the input strings and the number of strings. The output will be the minimum length of the string that can be formed by concatenating the remaining strings.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide the output of the code execution for the given input "3" because I'm unable to execute Java code.

I hope this helps in understanding the code and how it works. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
