:
The given Java code takes an input number `n` and converts it to a binary string. It then prints four binary strings:

1. A string where all bits are 0 except for the bits corresponding to the binary representation of `n`, which are 1.
2. A string where all bits are 1 except for the bits corresponding to the binary representation of `n`, which are 0.
3. A string where the bits corresponding to the binary representation of `n` are inverted.
4. A string where all bits are 0 except for the last bit, which is 1.

The input number `n` is `8` in this case.

Analysis:

1. The input number `n` is `8` which in binary is `1000`. So, the binary string corresponding to `n` is `1000`.
2. The first binary string is `00001000`. Here, all bits are 0 except for the bits corresponding to the binary representation of `n`, which are 1.
3. The second binary string is `11110111`. Here, all bits are 1 except for the bits corresponding to the binary representation of `n`, which are 0.
4. The third binary string is `1000`. Here, the bits corresponding to the binary representation of `n` are inverted.
5. The fourth binary string is `100000000`. Here, all bits are 0 except for the last bit, which is 1.

Output:

The output of the code will be:

```
00001000
11110111
1000
100000000
```

This is the expected output as per the analysis.

Please note that the output is printed in the console. You can run the code in your local environment to see the output.
