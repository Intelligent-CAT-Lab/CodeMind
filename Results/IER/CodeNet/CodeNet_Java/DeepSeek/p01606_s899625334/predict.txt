I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm not able to execute Java code. However, I can explain how the provided code works.

The provided Java code is a solution for a problem related to counting the number of divisors for a range of numbers. The code takes two inputs: the number of elements in the range (N) and the width of the range (W).

The code initializes an array `a` of size `N * 2 + 1` with all elements set to 0. Then it performs a series of operations on the array based on the values of N and W.

The code then prints the elements of the array from index 1 to `N - W + 1`. The elements of the array are cumulative sums of the previous elements.

The output of the code will depend on the values of N and W. The exact output will depend on the specific implementation of the code.

To run the code and get the output, you would need to run it in a Java environment with the appropriate inputs.

I hope this helps in understanding how the code works. If you have any specific questions about the code, feel free to ask.
