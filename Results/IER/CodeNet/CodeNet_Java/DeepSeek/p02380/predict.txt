The output of the code will be the area of the triangle, the length of the third side of the triangle, and the height of the triangle. However, since the input is `4 3 90`, the output will be:

```
6.0
5.0
3.0
```

This is because the area of the triangle is `6`, the length of the third side is `5`, and the height is `3`.
