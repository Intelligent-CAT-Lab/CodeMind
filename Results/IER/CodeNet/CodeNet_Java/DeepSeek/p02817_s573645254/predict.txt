The output of the code will be "atcoder".

The input "oder atc" is read by the Scanner object sc. The first string "oder" is stored in the variable S and the second string "atc" is stored in the variable T. 

Then, a StringBuilder object is created and the two strings are appended to it. The appended string is then printed to the console.

The output of the code is the concatenation of the two input strings in a different order.

So, the output of the code will be "atcoder".
