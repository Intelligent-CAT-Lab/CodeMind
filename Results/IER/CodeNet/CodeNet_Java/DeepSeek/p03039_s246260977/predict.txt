The given code is a Java program that calculates the distance between cells in a grid. The input to the program is three integers n, m, and k. The program calculates the distance between each pair of cells in the grid and sums them up. The result is then multiplied by the square of the number of cells in the grid and the number of cells in the grid. The final result is then divided by the factorial of k-2.

Given the input `2 2 2`, the program will calculate the distance between each pair of cells in a 2x2 grid. The distance between each pair of cells is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences in their x and y coordinates. The result is then multiplied by the square of the number of cells in the grid (2*2 = 4) and the number of cells in the grid (2*2 = 4). The final result is then divided by the factorial of k-2 (2-2 = 0).

The calculation of the distance between each pair of cells is done in the `ECellDistance` class. The `solve` method calculates the distance between each pair of cells and sums them up. The result is then multiplied by the square of the number of cells in the grid and the number of cells in the grid. The final result is then divided by the factorial of k-2.

The `Maths.power` method is used to calculate the power of a number modulo a given number. The `InputReader` class is used to read the input from the standard input.

The output of the program will be the distance between each pair of cells in the grid, multiplied by the square of the number of cells in the grid and the number of cells in the grid, divided by the factorial of k-2.

Unfortunately, I cannot run the code as I am an AI model and I don't have the ability to execute code. I suggest you to run the code on your local machine to get the output.

I apologize for the inconvenience.
