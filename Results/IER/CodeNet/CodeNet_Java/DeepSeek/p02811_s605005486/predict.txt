The provided Java code is a simple console-based application that reads two integers from the standard input, and then checks if the product of the two integers is less than or equal to 500. If the product is less than or equal to 500, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Given the input `2 900`, the product of 2 and 900 is 1800. Since 1800 is greater than 500, the output of the code would be "No".

So, the output of the code execution would be:

```
No
```

This output is based on the analysis of the code and the provided input.
