The given Java code is a recursive implementation of the Sierpinski's triangle fractal. It takes an integer input `n` which determines the recursion depth. The output of the code is the coordinates of the vertices of the Sierpinski's triangle fractal at each level of recursion.

The input `1` means that the recursion depth is 1. The output will be the coordinates of the vertices of the Sierpinski's triangle fractal at the first level of recursion.

The analysis of the code is as follows:

1. The main function reads an integer `n` from the standard input.
2. It then prints the initial point `(0, 0)`.
3. The `kock` function is called recursively with the initial points `(0, 0)` and `(100, 0)`, and the recursion depth `n`.
4. In the `kock` function, it calculates the midpoints of the line segment connecting the initial points and the new points.
5. It then prints the coordinates of the new points.
6. The function is called recursively with the new points and the recursion depth `n-1`.
7. This process continues until the recursion depth is 0.
8. After the recursion, it prints the final point `(100, 0)`.

The output of the code for the input `1` would be:

```
0.0 0.0
50.0 0.0
25.0 50.0
75.0 50.0
100.0 0.0
```

This output represents the vertices of the Sierpinski's triangle fractal at the first level of recursion.

OUTPUT
0.0 0.0
50.0 0.0
25.0 50.0
75.0 50.0
100.0 0.0
