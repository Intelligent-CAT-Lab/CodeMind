The input is a long integer K. The variable x is initialized with K modulo 50, and y is initialized with K divided by 50. Then an array a of size 50 is created.

In the for loop, the array a is filled with values. For each i from 0 to 49, the value i + y is assigned to a[i]. If i is greater than or equal to 50 - x, then 1 is added to a[i].

After the loop, the program prints 50, which is the size of the array a. Then it prints the elements of the array a, each separated by a space.

The output of the program will be a line of 50 space-separated numbers, where each number is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive. The numbers will be in ascending order, and there will be no duplicate numbers.

The reason for this output is that the array a is filled with the values i + y, and if i is greater than or equal to 50 - x, then 1 is added to a[i]. Therefore, the numbers in the array a will be between 0 and 49 inclusive, and there will be no duplicate numbers. The numbers in the array a will be in ascending order, because the loop iterates from 0 to 49.

The output of the program for the input 0 is:
50
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49
