The output of the code execution will be the number of integers i from 1 to max such that the sum of the digits of i raised to the power of n plus a equals i.

For the given input 16, 2, and 1000, the output will be 1 as there is only one integer i from 1 to 10 (calculated by raising 10 to the power of 1/2) such that the sum of the digits of i raised to the power of 2 plus 16 equals i.
