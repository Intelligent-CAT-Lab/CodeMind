### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO 自動生成されたメソッド・スタブ
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();

		int k = sc.nextInt();

		for(int i = 0; i < Math.pow(2, n); i++) {
			int bitArray[] = new int[n];
			int temp = i;
			int count = 0;
			for(int j = 0; temp > 0; j++) {
				if(temp % 2 == 1) {
					bitArray[j] = 1;
					count++;
				}
				temp /= 2;
			}

			if(count == k) {
				System.out.print(i + ":");  //順列のインデックス
				for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
					if(bitArray[j] == 1) System.out.print(" " + j);
				}
			}
			if(count == k) System.out.println();
		}
	}

}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `5 3`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Java code generates all possible permutations of a set of n elements, where the number of elements selected is k. The input to the program is two integers n and k, where n is the total number of elements and k is the number of elements to select.

The code uses a for loop to iterate over all possible combinations of 2^n (since there are 2^n possible combinations of n elements, each of which can be selected or not selected). For each combination, it creates an array of size n to represent the selected elements. It then converts the current combination number (i) to binary and stores the binary representation in the array. The binary representation corresponds to the selected elements in the permutation.

The code then checks if the number of selected elements (count) is equal to k. If it is, it prints the combination number and the indices of the selected elements. The combination number is the decimal representation of the binary number, and the indices are the positions of the selected elements in the original set.

The output of the code is the indices of the k-element subsets of a set of n elements, one subset per line. Each line starts with the combination number followed by the indices of the selected elements.

For the input `5 3`, the code will generate all possible 3-element subsets of a set of 5 elements.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the indices of the 3-element subsets of a set of 5 elements. Each line of the output will start with a combination number followed by the indices of the selected elements. The combination number is the decimal representation of the binary number, and the indices are the positions of the selected elements in the original set.

For example, for the input `5 3`, the output might look like this:

```
0: 0 1 2
1: 0 1 3
2: 0 2 3
3: 1 2 3
4: 0 1 4
5: 0 2 4
6: 1 2 4
7: 0 3 4
8: 1 3 4
9: 2 3 4
10: 0 1 4
11: 0 2 4
12: 1 2 4
13: 0 3 4
14: 1 3 4
15: 2 3 4
```

This output represents all possible 3-element subsets of a set of 5 elements. Each line of the output corresponds to a different subset of the set. The first number in each line is the combination number, and the remaining numbers are the indices of the elements in the subset.

Please note that the output will vary depending on the values of n and k.
