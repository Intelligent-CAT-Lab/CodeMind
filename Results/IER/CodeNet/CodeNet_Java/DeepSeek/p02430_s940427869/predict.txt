The output of the code will be the indices of the 3-element subsets of a set of 5 elements. Each line of the output will start with a combination number followed by the indices of the selected elements. The combination number is the decimal representation of the binary number, and the indices are the positions of the selected elements in the original set.

For example, for the input `5 3`, the output might look like this:

```
0: 0 1 2
1: 0 1 3
2: 0 2 3
3: 1 2 3
4: 0 1 4
5: 0 2 4
6: 1 2 4
7: 0 3 4
8: 1 3 4
9: 2 3 4
10: 0 1 4
11: 0 2 4
12: 1 2 4
13: 0 3 4
14: 1 3 4
15: 2 3 4
```

This output represents all possible 3-element subsets of a set of 5 elements. Each line of the output corresponds to a different subset of the set. The first number in each line is the combination number, and the remaining numbers are the indices of the elements in the subset.

Please note that the output will vary depending on the values of n and k.
