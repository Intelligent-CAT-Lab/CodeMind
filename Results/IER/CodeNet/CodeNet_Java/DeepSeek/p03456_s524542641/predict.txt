The given Java code is a program that checks if a number is a perfect square. It takes two inputs, a and b, where a is the first digit of the number and b is the last two digits of the number. It then checks if the number formed by concatenating a and b is a perfect square.

Let's analyze the code with the input `1 21`:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[]args){
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        int aa=String.valueOf(a).length();
        int bb=String.valueOf(b).length();
```

The program first creates a Scanner object to read the input. It then reads two integers a and b from the input. The length of these integers is stored in variables aa and bb.

```java
        if((aa==1&&bb==1)||(aa==2&&bb==1)||(aa==3&&bb==1)){
          int c=10*a+b;
         for(int i=0;i<c;i++){
            if(i*i==c){
                System.out.println("Yes");
                break;
            }else if(i==c-1){
                System.out.println("No");
            }
        
        }
```

If the length of b is 1, the program checks if the number formed by concatenating a and b is a perfect square. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

```java
        if((aa==1&&bb==2)||(aa==2&&bb==2)||(aa==3&&bb==2)){
            int c=100*a+b;
            for(int i=0;i<c;i++){
                if(i*i==c){
                    System.out.println("Yes");
                    break;
                }else if(i==c-1){
                    System.out.println("No");
                }
            
            }
    }
```

If the length of b is 2, the program does the same as above but with a number formed by concatenating a and b with 100 as the multiplier.

```java
        if((aa==1&&bb==3)||(aa==2&&bb==3)||(aa==3&&bb==3)){
            int c=1000*a+b;
            for(int i=0;i<c;i++){
                if(i*i==c){
                    System.out.println("Yes");
                    break;
                }else if(i==c-1){
                    System.out.println("No");
                }
            
            }
    }
```

If the length of b is 3, the program does the same as above but with a number formed by concatenating a and b with 1000 as the multiplier.

Given the input `1 21`, the program will check if the number formed by concatenating 1 and 21 is a perfect square.

The output of the program will be "Yes" if the number formed by concatenating 1 and 21 is a perfect square, and "No" otherwise.

Please note that this code does not handle cases where the input is not a two-digit number. It also does not handle cases where the input is a number with more than three digits.

I hope this helps in understanding how the code works with the given input.
