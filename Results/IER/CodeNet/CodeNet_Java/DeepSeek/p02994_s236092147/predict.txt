The output of the code will be the total sum of the numbers in the range from 1 to 5, where each number is increased by 1, excluding the number that is closest to 2.

The calculation is as follows:

- The smallest absolute difference between 2 and a number in the range from 1 to 5 is 1 (between 2 and 1).
- The number that has the smallest absolute difference is 1.
- The total sum of the numbers in the range from 1 to 5, excluding 1, is 1*(2+3+4+5) + 2*(3+4+5) + 3*(4+5) + 4*5 = 36.

So, the output of the code will be 36.
