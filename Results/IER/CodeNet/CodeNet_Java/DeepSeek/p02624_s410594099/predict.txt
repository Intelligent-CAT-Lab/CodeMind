The given Java code is a program that calculates the sum of the number of divisors for each number up to a given number n. The input to the program is a single integer n, and the output is the sum of the number of divisors for each number up to n.

The code uses a static array `arr` to store the number of divisors for each number up to n. The `compute()` method fills this array by iterating over each number from 1 to n and counting the number of divisors for each number. The number of divisors for a number i is stored in `arr[i]`.

The `main()` method reads the input integer n, initializes the `arr` array, computes the number of divisors for each number up to n, and then calculates the sum of the number of divisors for each number up to n. The sum is then printed to the standard output.

The input `4` would result in the following output:

```
15
```

This is because the number of divisors for each number up to 4 are:

- 1: 1
- 2: 2
- 3: 2
- 4: 3

And the sum of these is 1+2+2+3 = 8. However, the output is `15`, which seems to be a mistake in the provided code. The sum of the number of divisors for each number up to 4 should be `1+2+2+3 = 8`, not `1+2+2+3+4 = 15`.

I apologize for the confusion, and I hope this explanation helps clarify the code execution.
