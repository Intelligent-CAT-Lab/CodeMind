The output of the code will be the smallest power of 2 that satisfies the consumption rates of 8% and 10%. The input `2 2` means that the consumption rates are 8% and 10%, both of which are 2. The output of the code will be the smallest power of 2 that satisfies these rates.

For example, if the output of the code is 4, it means that the consumption rates of 8% and 10% are both 2 for a power of 2 that is 4.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the input values of A and B.
