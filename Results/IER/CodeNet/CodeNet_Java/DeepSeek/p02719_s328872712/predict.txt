Given the input `7 4`, the code checks the following conditions:

1. n is not 0, so it moves to the next condition.
2. n is not divisible by k, so it calculates the remainder of n divided by k. The remainder is 3, and the absolute difference between k and the remainder is also 3. Since 3 is less than 3, the output is 3.
