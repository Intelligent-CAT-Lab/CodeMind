You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the Deepseek Coder model, developed by Deepseek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science. For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.

### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Main mainObj = new Main();
		mainObj.solve();
	}

	public void solve() throws IOException {
		FastScanner fs = new FastScanner();
		int a = fs.nextInt();
		int b = fs.nextInt();
		int c = fs.nextInt();
		
		if(a == b && b == c) {
			System.out.println("Yes");
		}else {
			System.out.println("No");
		}
	}

	

	public class FastScanner {

		BufferedReader reader;
		private StringTokenizer st;

		public FastScanner() {
			st = null;
			reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		}

		public String next() throws IOException {
			if (st == null || !st.hasMoreElements()) {
				st = new StringTokenizer(reader.readLine());
			}
			return st.nextToken();
		}

		public String nextLine() throws IOException {
			st = null;
			String readLine = null;
			readLine = reader.readLine();
			return readLine;
		}

		public int nextInt() throws NumberFormatException, IOException {
			return Integer.parseInt(next());
		}

		public long nextLong() throws NumberFormatException, IOException {
			return Long.parseLong(next());
		}

		public int[] nextIntArr(int n) throws NumberFormatException, IOException {
			int[] retArr = new int[n];
			for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
				retArr[i] = nextInt();
			}
			return retArr;
		}

		public long[] nextLongArr(int n) throws NumberFormatException, IOException {
			long[] retArr = new long[n];
			for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
				retArr[i] = nextLong();
			}
			return retArr;
		}

		public void close() throws IOException {
			reader.close();
		}
	}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `2 2 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Java code reads three integers from the standard input and checks if they are all equal. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

The FastScanner class is used to read the input. It has methods to read an integer, a long number, an array of integers, and an array of long numbers. The next() method reads the next token from the input. The nextInt() method reads the next integer from the input. The nextLong() method reads the next long number from the input. The nextIntArr() and nextLongArr() methods read an array of integers or long numbers from the input.

In the main() method, the FastScanner object fs is created. The solve() method is called to read the three integers a, b, and c from the input using fs. If a, b, and c are all equal, the program prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

The input given is `2 2 2`.

The FastScanner object fs reads the input and the three integers a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 2 respectively. Since a, b, and c are all equal, the program prints "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
