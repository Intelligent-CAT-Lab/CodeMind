The output of the code for the given input `10 5` would be `6`.

Explanation:
The total distance D is 10 units and the length of the jump L is 5 units. 

The first jump covers 5 units of distance. So, the remaining distance to be covered is 10 - 5 = 5 units. 

The time taken to cover the remaining distance is 1 (the number of times D can be divided by L) + 5 (the remaining distance) = 6 units. 

So, the output of the code is `6`.
