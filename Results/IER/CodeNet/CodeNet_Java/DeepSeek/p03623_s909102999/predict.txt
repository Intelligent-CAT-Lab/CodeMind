The output of the code will be "B" if the absolute difference between `x` and `a` is greater than the absolute difference between `x` and `b`. Otherwise, it will print "A".

For the given input `5 2 7`, the absolute difference between `5` and `2` is greater than the absolute difference between `5` and `7`, so the output will be "B".
