### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Main {

	private static void solve(){
		//Implement solution here.
		int N = ni();
		System.out.println((N - 2) * 180);
	}

	//Switch input source (stdin/file)
	private static BufferedReader br;
	public static void main(String[] args){
		br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String debugDataPath = System.getenv("DD_PATH");        
		if(debugDataPath != null){
			try{
				br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(new File(debugDataPath))));
			}catch(Exception e){
				throw new RuntimeException(e);
			}
		}
		boolean hasNext = true;
		while(hasNext){
			solve();	
			try{
				br.mark(1);
				if(br.read() > 0){
					br.reset();			
					System.out.println("---");
				} else {
					hasNext = false;
				}
			}catch(Exception e){
				throw new RuntimeException(e);
			} 
		}
	}

	//Input read utility
	private static StringTokenizer tokenizer = null;
	public static String next() {
		while (tokenizer == null || !tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {
			try {
				tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
			} catch (Exception e) {
				throw new RuntimeException(e);
			}
		}
		return tokenizer.nextToken();
	}
	//Get next single int
	private static int ni() {
		return Integer.parseInt(next());
	}
	//Get next single long
	private static long nl() {
		return Long.parseLong(next());
	}
	//Get next single double
	private static double nd() {
		return Double.parseDouble(next());
	}
	//Get next int array from one line
	private static int[] na(int n) {
		int[] a = new int[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
			a[i] = ni();
		return a;
	}
	//Get next char array from one line
	private static char[] ns() {
		return next().toCharArray();
	}
	//Get next long array from one line
	private static long[] nal(int n) {
		long[] a = new long[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
			a[i] = nl();
		return a;
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

### Response
The provided Java code is a simple program that calculates the measure of a polygon given the number of its sides. The formula used to calculate the measure of a polygon is `(n - 2) * 180`, where `n` is the number of sides of the polygon.

Given the input `3`, the program calculates the measure of a polygon with 3 sides as follows:

```java
int N = ni(); // N is 3
System.out.println((N - 2) * 180); // (3 - 2) * 180 = 180
```

So, the output of the code execution would be `180`.

So, the analysis and output are as follows:

<<<Analysis>>>
The program reads an integer `N` from the input. It then calculates the measure of a polygon with `N` sides using the formula `(N - 2) * 180`.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the program is `180`.
