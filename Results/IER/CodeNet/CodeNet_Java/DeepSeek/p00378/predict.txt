The output of the code will be the total price of A's and B's that can be bought with X.

Let's calculate it:

X = 2400, A = 180, B = 100

X is not a multiple of 500, so we add 300 to X to make it a multiple of 500.

X = 2700

A = 180 < B = 100, so we calculate the number of A's that can be bought with X by dividing X by 1000 and adding 1 if X%1000 is greater than 0.

A = 1, X = 700

We calculate the number of B's that can be bought with X by dividing X by 500.

B = 14

So, the total price of A's and B's that can be bought with X is 180*1 + 100*14 = 2480.

So, the output of the code will be 2480.
