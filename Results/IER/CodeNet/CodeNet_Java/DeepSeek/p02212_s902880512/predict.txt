The output will be the minimum difference between the sum of two numbers and the total sum of the array.

For the input `2 1 3 4`, the total sum of the array is 10. The minimum difference would be calculated as follows:

- For the first iteration, the sum of the numbers 2 and 1 is 3, so the difference is 7 (10 - 3 * 2).
- For the second iteration, the sum of the numbers 2 and 3 is 5, so the difference is 5 (10 - 5 * 2).
- For the third iteration, the sum of the numbers 2 and 4 is 6, so the difference is 4 (10 - 6 * 2).

The minimum difference is 4, so the output of the code would be 4.
