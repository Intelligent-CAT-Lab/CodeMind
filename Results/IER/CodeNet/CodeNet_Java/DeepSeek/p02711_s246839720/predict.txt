The provided Java code reads an integer input from the user and checks if the first three digits of the input are 7. If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The code starts by importing the necessary classes.
2. The `Main` class contains the `main` method which is the entry point of the program.
3. Inside the `main` method, an instance of the `hayami` class is created.
4. The `nextHayami` method of the `hayami` class is called to read a string from the user.
5. The string is split into individual characters and stored in an array.
6. A boolean variable `flg` is initialized with `false`.
7. A for loop is used to iterate over the first three characters of the string. If any of the characters is "7", `flg` is set to `true`.
8. If `flg` is `true`, "Yes" is printed to the console. Otherwise, "No" is printed.

Now let's consider the input `117`:

1. The `nextHayami` method of the `hayami` class is called to read the input string "117".
2. The string is split into individual characters: `['1', '1', '7']`.
3. The for loop iterates over the first three characters: '1', '1', and '7'. Since all of them are not "7", `flg` remains `false`.
4. The condition `if(flg)` is `false`, so "No" is printed to the console.

So, the output of the code execution for the input `117` is "No".

Here is the output:

```
No
```
