The output of the code will depend on the values of the input variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `k`. If `k` is 1, the code will perform an operation that changes the values of `a` and `b`, and then print the difference between the new values of `a` and `b`. If `k` is 0, the code will not perform any operations and simply print the difference between the original values of `a` and `b`.

For the input `1 2 3 1`, the output will be `-1` because the value of `k` is 1, so the code performs an operation that changes the values of `a` and `b`, and then prints the difference between the new values of `a` and `b`.

For the input `1 2 3 0`, the output will be `-1` because the value of `k` is 0, so the code does not perform any operations and simply prints the difference between the original values of `a` and `b`.
