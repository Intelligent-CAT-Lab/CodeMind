The output of the program will be the area of the right-angled triangle.

For the input `3 4 5`, the program will calculate the area as follows:

1. It reads the input `3 4 5`.
2. It calculates the area of the triangle by multiplying `3` and `4` and dividing by 2.
3. It prints the calculated area, which is `6`.

So, the output of the program for the input `3 4 5` will be `6`.
