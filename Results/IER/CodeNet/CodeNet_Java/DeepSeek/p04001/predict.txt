The given Java code is a solution to a problem where you are given a number `S` and you need to find the sum of all possible numbers that can be formed by using the digits of `S`. The digits of `S` can be used in any order to form the numbers.

Here's how the code works:

1. It reads the input number `S`.
2. If `S` has only one digit, it prints `S` and exits the program.
3. It initializes an array `N` of integers with the digits of `S`.
4. It calculates the number of possible patterns that can be formed by using the digits of `S`.
5. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
6. It iterates over all possible patterns. For each pattern, it converts the pattern to a binary string and appends it to `tmpBit`.
7. For each pattern, it forms the numbers by using the digits of `S` and the pattern. It adds the formed number to `sum`.
8. Finally, it prints `sum` which is the sum of all possible numbers that can be formed by using the digits of `S`.

Given the input `125`, the code will first convert `125` to an array `N` of digits `[1, 2, 5]`. It will then calculate the number of possible patterns which is `2^3 = 8`. It will then iterate over all 8 possible patterns and for each pattern, it will form the numbers by using the digits of `S` and the pattern. It will add all these formed numbers to `sum`. Finally, it will print the value of `sum` which is the sum of all possible numbers that can be formed by using the digits of `S`.

Unfortunately, I cannot run the code for you as I am an AI model and I don't have the ability to execute code. I suggest you to run the code in your local environment to get the output.

I hope this helps you understand how the code works. Let me know if you have any other questions.
