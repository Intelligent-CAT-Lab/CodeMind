The output of the code will depend on the input. If the total value of the coins in the bank is 1000 or more, the code will print "1", otherwise it will print "0".

For the input `3 1 4 0 4 1`, the total value of the coins in the bank is calculated as `3*1 + 1*5 + 4*10 + 0*50 + 4*100 + 1*500 = 3 + 5 + 40 + 0 + 400 + 50 = 483`. Since 483 is less than 1000, the code will print "0".
