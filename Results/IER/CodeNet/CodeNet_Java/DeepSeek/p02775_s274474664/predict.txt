The given Java code is a solution to a problem where you are given a number N and you need to find the smallest number that is greater than N and has the same digits.

Here's how the code works:

1. The input number is read as a string and stored in the variable `N`.
2. The variable `W` is initialized with a size of `N.length()+1` and the first element is set to '0'. This is done to handle the edge case where the input number is a single digit.
3. The digits of the input number are copied into `W` starting from the second element.
4. The `sum` function is called with `W` and `W.length-1` as arguments. This function calculates the sum of the digits of the number represented by `W`.
5. The result is printed as the output.

The `sum` function calculates the sum of the digits of the number represented by `W` recursively. It does this by recursively calling itself with the next digit and adding the current digit to the sum. If the current digit is 5 or greater, it also checks if the next digit is greater than or equal to 5. If it is, it adds 10 minus the current digit to the sum and calls `add` to increment the next digit.

The `add` function increments the last digit of the number represented by `W`. If the last digit is '9', it sets the digit to '0' and calls itself with the previous digit. If the last digit is not '9', it increments the digit.

Given the input `36`, the output of the code would be `39`. The smallest number greater than `36` with the same digits is `39`.

Here's the output:

```
39
```

This output is based on the analysis and the provided code.
