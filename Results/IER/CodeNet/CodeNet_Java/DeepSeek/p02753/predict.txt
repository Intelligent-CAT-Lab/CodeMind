The provided Java code checks if the first character of the input string is the same as the second character and the third character. If they are all the same, it prints "No", otherwise it prints "Yes".

Given the input "ABA", the first character (A) is the same as the second character (B) and the third character (A), so the output of the code would be "No".

Here is the analysis:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main{

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        String S = in.next();
        if(S.charAt(0) == S.charAt(1) && S.charAt(1) == S.charAt(2)){
            println("No");
        }
        else{
            println("Yes");
        }    
        in.close();
        out.close();
    }

    // ... rest of the code ...
}
```

The `in.next()` method reads the next string from the input. In this case, it reads the string "ABA". The `charAt(0)` method returns the character at the 0th index of the string, which is 'A'. The `charAt(1)` method returns the character at the 1st index of the string, which is 'B'. The `charAt(2)` method returns the character at the 2nd index of the string, which is also 'A'. Since all these characters are the same, the condition `S.charAt(0) == S.charAt(1) && S.charAt(1) == S.charAt(2)` is true, so the code prints "No".

So, the output of the code execution given the input "ABA" is:

```
No
```
