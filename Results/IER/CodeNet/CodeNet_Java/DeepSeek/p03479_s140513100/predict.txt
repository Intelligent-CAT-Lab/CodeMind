The output of the code will be 4.

The first value of first is 3, which is less than 20. So, the value of first is doubled to 6. The value of first is now 6, which is still less than 20. So, the value of first is doubled to 12. The value of first is now 12, which is still less than 20. So, the value of first is doubled to 24. The value of first is now 24, which is not less than 20. So, the loop stops. The number of times the loop executed is 4, which is the output of the program.
