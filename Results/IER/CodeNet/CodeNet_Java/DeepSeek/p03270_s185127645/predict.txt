The given Java code is a solution for a problem from the Codeforces Round #610 (Div. 2). The problem is about counting the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements, where the elements are distinct and the chosen elements are arranged in a specific way.

The code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The main idea is to pre-calculate the binomial coefficients and the number of ways to arrange k elements in a set of n elements. Then it uses these pre-calculated values to calculate the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements.

The input to the program is two integers k and n, where 1 <= k <= n <= 2000. The program prints k lines, where the i-th line contains the number of ways to choose i elements from a set of n elements.

Given the input `3 3`, the program will calculate and print the number of ways to choose 2, 3, and 4 elements from a set of 3 elements.

Unfortunately, I cannot run the code here because this platform does not support Java code execution. You can try running the code on your local machine or any online Java compiler to get the output.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how the code works and how to run it. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
