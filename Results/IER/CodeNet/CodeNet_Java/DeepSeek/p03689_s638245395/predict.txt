The given Java code is a program that reads four integers from the standard input, H, W, h, and w. It then checks if H and W are divisible by h and w respectively. If they are, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes". After that, it creates a 2D array of size H x W and fills it with certain values based on the conditions. Finally, it prints the 2D array.

Given the input `3 3 2 2`, the program will print "Yes" because H and W are not divisible by h and w respectively. Then it will print a 2D array of size 3x3. The array will be filled with 1_000_000_000 - 1 at positions where i and j are multiples of h and w respectively, and -1_000_000_000 at positions where i + h - 1 and j + w - 1 are within the range of H and W respectively.

Here is the output:

```
Yes
1_000_000_000 1_000_000_000 1_000_000_000 
1_000_000_000 -1_000_000_000 1_000_000_000 
1_000_000_000 1_000_000_000 -1_000_000_000 
```

This output indicates that the program has filled the 2D array with 1_000_000_000 - 1 at positions where i and j are multiples of 2, and -1_000_000_000 at positions where i + h - 1 and j + w - 1 are within the range of 3 and 3 respectively.

This is a simple example of how a Java program can interact with the user and process input to generate output.
