The output of the code execution for the input `5R2D` would be: `ksr`.

This is because:
- The number `5` corresponds to the consonant `k`.
- The direction `R` corresponds to the vowel `a` (right).
- The number `2` corresponds to the consonant `s`.
- The direction `2D` corresponds to the vowel `u` (up) and the vowel `e` (down).

So the final output is `ksraue`.
