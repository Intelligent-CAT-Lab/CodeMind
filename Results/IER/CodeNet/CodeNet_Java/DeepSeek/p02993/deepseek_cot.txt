### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class Main {


    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        String word = s.next();
        boolean flag = false;
        for(int i=0;i<word.length()-1;i++){
            if(word.charAt(i)==word.charAt(i+1)){
                flag = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if(flag) System.out.println("Bad");
        else System.out.println("Good");
    }




}


class Scanner
{
    StringTokenizer st;
    BufferedReader br;

    public Scanner(InputStream s){	br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(s));}

    public String next() throws IOException
    {
        while (st == null || !st.hasMoreTokens())
            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
        return st.nextToken();
    }

    public int nextInt() throws IOException {return Integer.parseInt(next());}

    public long nextLong() throws IOException {return Long.parseLong(next());}

    public String nextLine() throws IOException {return br.readLine();}

    public double nextDouble() throws IOException
    {
        String x = next();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("0");
        double res = 0, f = 1;
        boolean dec = false, neg = false;
        int start = 0;
        if(x.charAt(0) == '-')
        {
            neg = true;
            start++;
        }
        for(int i = start; i < x.length(); i++)
            if(x.charAt(i) == '.')
            {
                res = Long.parseLong(sb.toString());
                sb = new StringBuilder("0");
                dec = true;
            }
            else
            {
                sb.append(x.charAt(i));
                if(dec)
                    f *= 10;
            }
        res += Long.parseLong(sb.toString()) / f;
        return res * (neg?-1:1);
    }

    public boolean ready() throws IOException {return br.ready();}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3776`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
The given code is a Java program that checks if there are any two consecutive characters in a given string that are the same. If there are, it prints "Bad"; otherwise, it prints "Good".

The input to the program is a string of digits. The program reads this string from the standard input (System.in), and checks each pair of consecutive characters to see if they are the same.

Here's how the code works:

1. The Scanner object `s` reads the input string from the standard input.
2. The `next()` method of the Scanner class is used to read the input string.
3. A for loop is used to iterate over each character in the string. For each character, it checks if the next character is the same. If a pair of consecutive characters are the same, the `flag` variable is set to `true` and the loop is exited.
4. If the `flag` variable is `true`, the program prints "Bad". Otherwise, it prints "Good".

Given the input `3776`, the code will check each pair of consecutive characters in the string. Since there are two consecutive '7's, the `flag` variable will be set to `true` and the program will print "Bad".

So, the output of the code execution would be:

```
Bad
```

Here's the complete analysis:

<<<Analysis>>>
The program reads a string of digits from the standard input. It then checks each pair of consecutive characters in the string to see if they are the same. If it finds a pair of consecutive characters that are the same, it sets a flag to `true` and exits the loop. Finally, it prints "Bad" if the flag is `true`, and "Good" otherwise.

Given the input `3776`, the program will check each pair of consecutive characters in the string. Since there are two consecutive '7's, the flag will be set to `true` and the program will print "Bad".

<<<Output>>>
Bad
