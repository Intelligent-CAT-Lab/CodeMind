The provided Java code is a simple implementation of a function that calculates a sequence based on a given formula. The formula is `x[i] = r * x[i-1] - d`, where `x[i]` is the i-th term of the sequence, `r` and `d` are constants, and `x[0]` is the initial term of the sequence.

Given the input `2 10 20`, let's analyze the code execution step by step:

1. The input is read from the standard input (`System.in`).
