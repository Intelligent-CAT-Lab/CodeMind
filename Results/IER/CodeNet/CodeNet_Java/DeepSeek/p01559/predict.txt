The output of the code will be the number of paths from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, avoiding the obstacles. Since there are no obstacles, the output should be the number of paths from the top left corner to the bottom right corner in a grid of size 3x3.

This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of paths in a grid of size nxn is given by the formula `(n-1)^2`. So for a 3x3 grid, the output should be `(3-1)^2 = 8`.
