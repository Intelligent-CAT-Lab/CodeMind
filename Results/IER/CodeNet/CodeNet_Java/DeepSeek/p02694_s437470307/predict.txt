The output of the code will be `3`.

Explanation:

- P is initially 100.
- After the first iteration, P becomes 100 + 10 = 110.
- After the second iteration, P becomes 110 + 11 = 121.
- After the third iteration, P becomes 121 + 12 = 133.
- Since 133 is greater than 103, the loop stops.
- So, the output is 3.
