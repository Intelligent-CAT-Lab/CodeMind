The output of the code execution given the input `2 2` would be 15.

This is because for each value of x from 0 to 2, there are 3 possible values of y (0, 1, 2) and for each pair of x and y, there is one possible value of z (0, 1, 2). So there are 3*3 = 9 combinations for x and y, and 3 combinations for z, making a total of 15 combinations.
