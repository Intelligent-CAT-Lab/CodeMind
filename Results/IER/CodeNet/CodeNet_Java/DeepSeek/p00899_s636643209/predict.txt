I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm unable to execute Java code. However, I can provide you with an analysis of the code you provided.

The code you provided is a Java program that reads an integer `n` from the standard input, followed by `n` strings. It then tries to find the minimum length of a string that can be formed by concatenating the given strings in such a way that no two strings are identical.

The `solver` function is the main function that performs the task. It uses a bitmask to represent the state of the strings. For each bit in the mask, it checks if the corresponding string can be appended to the current string without making it identical to another string. If it can, it updates the state of the strings and continues. If it can't, it tries the next string.

The `dp` function is a dynamic programming function that calculates the minimum length of the string for a given state of the strings. It uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

The `same_length` function calculates the maximum length of the common suffix of two strings.

The `tr` function is a utility function that prints the contents of an array to the standard output.

The output of the program will be the minimum length of the string that can be formed by concatenating the given strings.

Please provide the input for the code execution, and I'll be able to provide the output based on your input.
