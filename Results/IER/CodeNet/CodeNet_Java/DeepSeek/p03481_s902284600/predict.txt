The output of the code will be 4.

The reason is that in the first iteration, x becomes 6 (3*2). It is still less than y (20), so the loop continues. In the second iteration, x becomes 12 (6*2). It is still less than y, so the loop continues. In the third iteration, x becomes 24 (12*2). It is still less than y, so the loop continues. Finally, in the fourth iteration, x becomes 48 (24*2). It is now greater than y (20), so the loop breaks. So, the output of the code is 4.
