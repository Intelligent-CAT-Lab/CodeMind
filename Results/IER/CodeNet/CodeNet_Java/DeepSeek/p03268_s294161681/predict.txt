The output of the code will depend on the values of n and k. The output is the number of cubes that can be stacked together.

For example, if n = 3 and k = 2, then the output would be 1 because there is 1 cube that can be stacked together. If n = 4 and k = 2, then the output would be 2 because there are 2 cubes that can be stacked together.

So, for the input `3 2`, the output would be 1.
