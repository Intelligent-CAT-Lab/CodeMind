The output of the code execution for the input `2 2` would be 4.

The reason for this is that the solve function is called twice with the arguments (2, 2) and (2, 1). The solve function calculates the factorial of 2 as 2 * 1 = 2, and the solve function calculates the factorial of 2 as 2 * 1 = 2. The sum of these two results is 2 + 2 = 4.

So, the output of the code execution for the input `2 2` is 4.
