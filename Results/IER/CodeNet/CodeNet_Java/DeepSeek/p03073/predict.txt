The output of the code would be `0`. The string `000` has length `3`. The string is split into `["0", "0", "0"]`. The for loop checks each character in the string. Since all characters are `0` and the indices are even, the count is `3`. After subtracting the count from the length, the length is `0`, so `0` is printed as the output.
