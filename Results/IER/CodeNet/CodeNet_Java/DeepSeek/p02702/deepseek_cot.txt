### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.

        // -> 18171 ≡ 0 (mod 2019)

        // map: d[]の値の頻度

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Java code is designed to count the number of substrings in a given string that are divisible by 2019. The input string is read from the standard input.

The code first initializes an array `d` of size `n+1`, where `n` is the length of the input string. The array `d` is used to store the remainder of the division of the string from right to left by 2019. The remainder of the division of the string from right to left by 2019 is calculated by multiplying the current character of the string by `10^i` (mod 2019), where `i` is the position of the current character in the string, and adding the remainder of the division of the string from right to left by 2019 by 1.

The code then counts the frequency of each remainder in the array `d`. The count of each remainder is stored in a HashMap. The count of each remainder is calculated by counting the number of times each remainder appears in the array `d`.

Finally, the code calculates the number of substrings in the input string that are divisible by 2019. The number of substrings that are divisible by 2019 is calculated by summing the number of pairs of remainders that are the same in the HashMap. The number of pairs of remainders that are the same is calculated by dividing the count of each remainder by 2.

The output of the code is the number of substrings in the input string that are divisible by 2019.

Given the input string `1817181712114`, the code will calculate the number of substrings in the input string that are divisible by 2019.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the number of substrings in the input string that are divisible by 2019.
