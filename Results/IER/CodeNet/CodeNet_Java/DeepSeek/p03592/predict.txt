The provided Java code is a program that checks if there are any pairs of integers (i, j) such that i*N + j*M = K, where N, M, and K are given inputs.

Given the input `2 2 2`, the analysis of the code would be as follows:

1. The program reads three integers N, M, and K from the standard input. Here, N = 2, M = 2, and K = 2.

2. The program then enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates over the range from 0 to N (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates over the range from 0 to M (inclusive).

3. For each pair (i, j), the program calculates the sum `M * i + N * j - (i * j * 2)`. If this sum equals K, the program prints "Yes" and terminates.

4. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, the program prints "No".

Based on the above analysis, the output of the code would be "Yes" because there exists a pair (1, 1) such that 2*2 + 2*1 - (1*1*2) = 2.

So, the output of the code would be:

```
Yes
```

Please note that the code assumes that the input is given in the correct format and does not handle potential exceptions or errors.
