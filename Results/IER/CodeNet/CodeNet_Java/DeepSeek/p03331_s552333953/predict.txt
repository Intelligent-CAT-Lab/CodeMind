The output of the code will be the second smallest number in the sorted `c` array. Since the `c` array is sorted in ascending order, the second smallest number will be the second element in the `c` array.

However, without running the code, it's impossible to determine the exact output. The output will depend on the values of the elements in the `a` and `b` arrays, which are calculated based on the input `N`.
