### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int N[] = new int[4];
		for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
			N[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		boolean ans  = false;
		Arrays.sort(N);
		if (N[0] == 1 && N[1] ==4 && N[2]==7 && N[3]==9) {
			ans = true;
		}
		if (ans) {
			System.out.println("YES");
		} else {
			System.out.println("NO");
		}
	}
}

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `1 7 9 4`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object sc to read the input. Then it creates an integer array N of size 4. The code then enters a for loop that runs 4 times. In each iteration, it reads an integer from the input and stores it in the corresponding index of the array N. After the for loop, it sorts the array N in ascending order. It then checks if the first element of the sorted array is 1, the second element is 4, the third element is 7, and the fourth element is 9. If all these conditions are met, it sets the boolean variable ans to true. Finally, it checks the value of ans. If it is true, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

Given the input `1 7 9 4`, the code will first sort the array `[1, 7, 9, 4]` to `[1, 4, 7, 9]`. Then it checks if the first element is 1, the second element is 4, the third element is 7, and the fourth element is 9. Since these conditions are met, it sets ans to true and prints "YES".

<<<Output>>>
YES
