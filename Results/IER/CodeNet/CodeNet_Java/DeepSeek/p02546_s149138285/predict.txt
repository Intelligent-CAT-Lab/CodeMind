I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by Deepseek, I'm not capable of executing Java code or any other programming language code. I can only provide information and help related to programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and other computer science topics. I suggest you to run the provided Java code in your local environment to get the output.

For the given Java code, it seems to be a code for adding "s" or "es" to the end of a word based on the last character of the word. If you provide an input of "apple", the output should be "apples" as the last character of "apple" is "e".

If you have any questions related to the code or any other programming concepts, feel free to ask.
