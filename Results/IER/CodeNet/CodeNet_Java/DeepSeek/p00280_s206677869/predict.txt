The output of the code will be a list of all possible sequences of actions that lead to a player winning 2 sets and an opponent winning 2 sets. Each sequence will be a string of characters, where 'A' represents a point for the player and 'B' represents a point for the opponent. The sequences will be printed in lexicographic order.

For example, one possible output could be:
```
AAAB
AABA
ABAA
ABBA
BAAB
BAAA
```
This output represents the following sequences of actions:
- AAAB: The player wins the first set, then the opponent wins the next two sets.
- AABA: The player wins the first set, then the player wins the next set and the opponent wins the next set.
- ABAA: The player wins the first set, then the player wins the next set and the opponent wins the next set.
- ...
- BAAB: The opponent wins the first set, then the player wins the next set and the opponent wins the next set.
- BAAA: The opponent wins the first set, then the opponent wins the next set and the player wins the next set.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the specific input and the rules of the game.
