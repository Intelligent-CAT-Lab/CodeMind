The given Java code is a simple binary to ASCII converter. It uses two maps, `dec1` and `dec2`, to map characters to binary strings and vice versa. The input is a string of characters, which are converted to binary using `dec1`, then decoded using `dec2`.

The input string `?D-C'KOPUA` is processed step by step as follows:

1. The input string is converted to binary using `dec1`. The resulting binary string is `11111010110011010110101011110101`.

2. The binary string is then decoded using `dec2`. The decoded string is `D-C'KOPUA`.

So, the output of the code execution given the input `?D-C'KOPUA` is `D-C'KOPUA`.

Here is the output:

```
D-C'KOPUA
```
