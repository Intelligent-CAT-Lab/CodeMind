The input is four integers: r, g, b, and n. The program is trying to find the number of ways to represent n as the sum of certain numbers of r, g, and b. The numbers of r, g, and b are non-negative integers.

The program uses two nested for loops to iterate through all possible combinations of r, g, and b. The outer loop iterates through all possible numbers of r, and the inner loop iterates through all possible numbers of g. For each pair of r and g, the program checks if there exists a number of b that makes the sum of r, g, and b equal to n. If such a number of b exists, the program increments the variable ans.

The program then prints the value of ans, which is the number of ways to represent n as the sum of certain numbers of r, g, and b.

The code is written in Java. It uses the Scanner class to read the input from the standard input. The input is read in the order of r, g, b, and n. The variables r, g, b, and n are initialized with the values read from the input.

The outer loop runs from 0 to n / r. The inner loop runs from 0 to (n - i * r) / g. For each pair of i and j, the program checks if (n - i * r - j * g) % b == 0. If it is, the program increments ans.

The program then prints the value of ans, which is the number of ways to represent n as the sum of certain numbers of r, g, and b.
