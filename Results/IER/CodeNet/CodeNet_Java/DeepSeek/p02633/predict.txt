I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm not able to execute Java code. However, I can provide you with an analysis of the code you provided.

The provided Java code is a custom scanner class named "hayami" that reads input from the standard input. It has methods to read integers, longs, and strings. The main method in the Main class reads an integer from the input, calculates the smallest multiple of 360 that is greater than or equal to the input integer, and prints it.

The analysis of the code execution with the input `90` would be:

1. The main method reads an integer from the input using the `saori_hayami` method of the "hayami" class. In this case, it reads `90`.
2. The main method then enters a while loop that continues until it finds a multiple of 360 that is greater than or equal to `90`. The current value of the integer `i` is checked by dividing it by 360 and checking if the remainder is 0.
3. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
4. Once a multiple of 360 is found, it is printed to the standard output.

The output of the code execution with the input `90` would be the smallest multiple of 360 that is greater than or equal to `90`, which is `360`.

So, the output of the code execution would be:

```
360
```

Please note that to run this code, you would need to provide the input `90` when prompted.
