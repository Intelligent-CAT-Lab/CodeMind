The output will be `3`.

Explanation:

- First, `a` is 100. It is less than `x` (103), so `a` is doubled to 200. `count` is incremented to 1.
- Then, `a` is 200. It is still less than `x`, so `a` is doubled to 400. `count` is incremented to 2.
- Finally, `a` is 400. It is greater than or equal to `x` (103), so the loop breaks. The final value of `count` is 3, so the output is `3`.
