The given Java code generates all possible permutations of a given number of digits and prints them in ascending order.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The main function reads an integer n from the input.
2. It creates an array of integers `base` of size `n`, where each element is initialized with its index plus one.
3. The `make` function is called with the parameters `0`, `0`, `base`, and `n`. This function generates all possible permutations of the digits in `base` and adds them to the `TreeSet` `all`.
4. The `toString` function is used to convert an integer to a string of digits.
5. The `TreeSet` `all` is iterated over and each permutation is converted to a string using `toString` and appended to a `StringBuilder`.
6. The `StringBuilder` is converted to a string and printed.

Given the input `2`, the output of the code will be:

```
12
21
```

This is because the `base` array is `[1, 2]` and the `make` function generates all permutations of these digits.

So, the output of the code execution is:

```
12
21
```

```
