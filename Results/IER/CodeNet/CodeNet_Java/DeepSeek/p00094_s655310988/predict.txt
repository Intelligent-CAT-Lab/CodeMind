The output of the code would be the area of the rectangular field in yards, calculated by multiplying the dimensions in feet by 3.305785 and then dividing by 3.305785.

So, the calculation would be:

15 (feet) * 25 (feet) * 3.305785 (conversion factor from feet to yards) / 3.305785 = 130.273952 yards^2.

So, the output of the code would be `130.273952`.
