### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.

84

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
        BufferedReader f = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out));
        String str = f.readLine();
        int n = str.length();
        long sum = 0;
        int ptr = 0;
        long cnt = 0;
        long curr = 0;
        while(ptr < n){
            if(str.charAt(ptr) == '>'){
                while(ptr < n && str.charAt(ptr) == '>'){
                    ptr++;
                    cnt++;
                }
                if(curr > cnt){
                    sum+=(curr+(((cnt)*(cnt-1))/2));
                }else{
                    sum+=(((cnt+1)*(cnt))/2);
                }
                curr = 0;
                cnt = 0;
            }else{
                sum+=curr;
                curr++;
                ptr++;
            }
        }
        if(str.charAt(n-1) == '<') sum+=curr;
        out.println(sum);
        out.close();
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `<>>`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is a Java program that reads a string of characters from the standard input, and then calculates a sum based on the characters in the string. The string can contain two types of characters: '<' and '>'. 

The program works as follows:

1. It initializes several variables: `n` (the length of the input string), `sum` (the total sum), `ptr` (a pointer to the current position in the string), `cnt` (a counter for the number of '>' characters), and `curr` (a counter for the number of '<' characters).

2. It then enters a while loop that continues until `ptr` is less than `n`. Inside the loop, it checks the character at the current position in the string. 

   - If the character is '>', it increments `cnt` and `ptr`. Then it checks if `curr` is greater than `cnt`. If it is, it adds `curr` plus the sum of the first `cnt` numbers to `sum`. If `curr` is not greater than `cnt`, it adds the sum of the first `cnt+1` numbers to `sum`. It then resets `curr` and `cnt` to 0 and continues.
   
   - If the character is '<', it adds `curr` to `sum` and increments `curr` and `ptr`.

3. After the loop, if the last character in the string is '<', it adds `curr` to `sum`.

4. Finally, it prints the value of `sum`.

Given the input `<<>>`, the output of the program would be 3.
