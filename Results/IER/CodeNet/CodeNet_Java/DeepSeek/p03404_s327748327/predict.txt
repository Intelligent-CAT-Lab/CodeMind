The output of the program is a 100x100 grid where each cell is either a hash or a dot. The number of hashes and dots in the grid is determined by the input integers `a` and `b`.

For the input `2 3`, the output would be a 100x100 grid where the first 2x2 squares are filled with hashes, and the remaining cells are filled with dots.
```

Please note that the actual output of the program would depend on the specific values of `a` and `b`.

I'm sorry, but I can't execute the code as I'm an AI model and I don't have the ability to run code.
