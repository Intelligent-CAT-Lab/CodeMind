### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>


import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = Integer.parseInt(scan.next());
        scan.close();

        List<String> list = func(n);

        for (String s : list) {
            System.out.println(s);
        }

    }

    private static List<String> func(int n) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
        if (n == 1) {
            list.add("a");
        } else {
            List<String> prevList = func(n - 1);
            for (String s : prevList) {
                // 含まれている最大の文字を探索
                char max = 'a';
                for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
                    if (max < s.charAt(i)) {
                        max = s.charAt(i);
                    }
                }

                for (char c = 'a'; c <= max + 1; c++) {
                    String newString = s + c;
                    list.add(newString);
                }
            }
        }
        return list;
    }
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `1`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n from the user and generates all possible strings of length n that can be formed by using the characters 'a' to 'z' in lexicographical order.

The function `func(int n)` is a recursive function that generates all possible strings of length n. It starts with the base case where n=1, and returns a list containing the string "a". For n > 1, it calls itself with n-1, and then appends each character 'a' to 'z' to each string in the returned list.

The main function reads the input n, calls `func(n)` to get the list of strings, and then prints each string in the list.

The output of the code will be all possible strings of length n that can be formed by using the characters 'a' to 'z' in lexicographical order.

For example, if the input is `1`, the output will be:
```
a
b
c
...
z
```
If the input is `2`, the output will be:
```
aa
ab
ac
...
az
ba
bb
bc
...
bz
...
zz
```
And so on.

<<<Output>>>
As the question does not provide an input, I cannot generate the output. Please provide an input and I will be able to generate the output.
