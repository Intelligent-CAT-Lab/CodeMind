I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm unable to execute Java code. However, I can provide you with an analysis of the code you provided.

The code you provided is a Java implementation of a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) using Xorshift+ algorithm. The input to the code is three integers: `n`, `k`, and `x0`.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the code:

1. The code first reads three integers from the standard input: `n`, `k`, and `x0`.

2. If `x0` is 0, the code prints 0 and terminates.

3. The code then initializes an array `c` of size `Long.MAX_VALUE / DIV + SHIFT + 1`. This array will be used to count the number of occurrences of each value of `x` modulo `DIV`.

4. The code then generates `n` pseudorandom numbers using the Xorshift+ algorithm and increments the corresponding element in the `c` array.

5. The code then finds the position `pos` in the `c` array such that `k` elements have been counted up to `pos`.

6. The code generates a new array `list` of size `c[pos]` and fills it with the `x` values that correspond to the elements of `c` at position `pos`.

7. The code sorts the `list` array and prints the `k`th smallest element.

The output of the code will depend on the values of `n`, `k`, and `x0`.

Please provide the input for the code and I can provide the output.
