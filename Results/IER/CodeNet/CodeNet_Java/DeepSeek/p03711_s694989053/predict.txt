The output of the code will depend on the input values x and y. If x and y are both 1 or 3, the output will be "Yes" because both x and y are in array A. If x is 1 and y is 4, the output will be "No" because x is in array A but y is not. If x is 2 and y is 5, the output will be "Yes" because both x and y are "C".
