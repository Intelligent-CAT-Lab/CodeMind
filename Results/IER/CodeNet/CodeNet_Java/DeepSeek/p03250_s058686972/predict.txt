The output of the code will be the maximum value among the three possibilities. In this case, the input is 1, 5, and 2. The maximum value is calculated as follows:

1. a*10+b+c = 10+5+2 = 17
2. a+b*10+c = 1+50+2 = 53
3. a+b+c*10 = 1+5+20 = 26

So, the maximum value is 53. Therefore, the output of the code will be 53.
