The output of the program will depend on the input values of n and k. The output is the number of valid squares that can be formed by summing n squares, where the sum of the numbers in each square is divisible by 11 and the remainder of the division is equal to k.

For the input `7 7`, the output of the program will be the number of valid squares that can be formed by summing 7 squares, where the sum of the numbers in each square is divisible by 11 and the remainder of the division is 7.

Please note that the actual output of the program will depend on the specific values of n and k, and the calculation of the output may take some time due to the large number of iterations involved in the calculations.
