### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //コード
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Integer n = Integer.parseInt(scanner.next());
        Integer m = Integer.parseInt(scanner.next());
        int total = 0;

        total += (n * (n-1) / 2);
        total += (m * (m-1) / 2);

        System.out.println(total);
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `2 1`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is a Java program that calculates the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of n elements and m elements. The input to the program is two integers n and m.

The code first creates a Scanner object to read the input from the standard input. It then reads two integers from the input using the next() method of the Scanner class and converts them to integers using Integer.parseInt().

The code then calculates the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of n elements and m elements. This is done by using the formula for the number of combinations of 2 elements from a set of n elements, which is n*(n-1)/2. The same formula is used for the set of m elements.

The total number of ways to choose 2 elements from both sets is then calculated by adding the results of the two calculations.

Finally, the total number of ways to choose 2 elements from both sets is printed to the standard output using the println() method of the System.out PrintStream.

Given the input `2 1`, the program calculates the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of 2 elements and a set of 1 element.

The number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of 2 elements is calculated as 2*(2-1)/2 = 1.
The number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of 1 element is calculated as 1*(1-1)/2 = 0.

The total number of ways to choose 2 elements from both sets is then calculated as 1 + 0 = 1.

So the output of the program for the input `2 1` is `1`.

<<<Output>>>
1
