The given Java code is a FizzBuzz implementation where numbers are replaced with "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz" based on the number's divisibility by 3, 5 and 15 respectively. The code also prints the numbers from 1 to n (input) in the FizzBuzz format.

The input `1` is given to the code, which means the output should be the numbers from 1 to 1 in the FizzBuzz format. According to the FizzBuzz rules, numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "Fizz", numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "Buzz", and numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced with "FizzBuzz".

So, the output of the code for the input `1` should be:

```
1
```

This is because the only number from 1 to 1 that is divisible by 3, 5 or both is 1 itself. So, it prints "1" as it is.

So, the output of the code execution for the input `1` is:

```
1
```

Please note that the code execution is not provided as it is a theoretical analysis and not a real execution of the code.
