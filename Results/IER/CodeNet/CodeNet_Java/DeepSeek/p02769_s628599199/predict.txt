The given code is a Java program that calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of 2n elements, where n is the input number. The elements are numbered from 1 to 2n. The program uses the formula for combinations, which is nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nCk = nC
