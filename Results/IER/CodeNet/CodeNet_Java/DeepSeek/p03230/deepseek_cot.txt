### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
	static int v = 0;
	static List<List<Integer>> ansList = null;

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
		br.close();

		if (n == 1) {
			System.out.println("Yes");
			System.out.println(2);
			System.out.println("1 1");
			System.out.println("1 1");
			return;
		}
		if (n == 2) {
			System.out.println("No");
			return;
		}

		int k = 0;
		for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
			int ic2 = i * (i - 1) / 2;
			if (ic2 == n) {
				k = i;
				break;
			} else if (ic2 > n) {
				System.out.println("No");
				return;
			}
		}
		System.out.println("Yes");

		ansList = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>(k);
		int[] target = new int[k];
		for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
			ansList.add(new ArrayList<Integer>(k - 1));
			target[i] = i;
		}
		combination(target, 2, new ArrayList<Integer>());

		System.out.println(k);
		for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
			StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
			sb.append(k - 1).append(' ');
			List<Integer> list = ansList.get(i);
			for (int j : list) {
				sb.append(j).append(' ');
			}
			sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);
			System.out.println(sb.toString());
		}
	}

	static void combination(int[] target, int k, List<Integer> list) {
		if (list.size() == k) {
			v++;
			for (int i : list) {
				ansList.get(i).add(v);
			}
			return;
		}

		int i = 0;
		if (!list.isEmpty()) {
			i = list.get(list.size() - 1) + 1;
			if (list.size() + target.length - i < k) {
				return;
			}
		}
		for ( ; i < target.length; i++) {
			list.add(i);
			combination(target, k, list);
			list.remove(list.size() - 1);
		}
	}
}

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Java code is used to generate a binary tree of n nodes. The input is the number of nodes n. The code first checks if the input is 1 or 2. If it is 1, the code prints "Yes", the number of nodes is 2, and the tree is a single node. If it is 2, the code prints "No". If the input is greater than 2, the code calculates the number of nodes k in the tree. If k*(k-1)/2 is equal to the input, it means the input is a valid number of nodes for a binary tree. If it is greater, the code prints "No". If it is valid, the code prints "Yes" and the number of nodes k. It then generates the tree by adding edges to the nodes. The edges are represented as pairs of integers. The first integer is the parent node, and the second integer is the child node. The code uses a recursive function to generate the combinations of nodes. The function takes an array of nodes, the number of nodes to select, and a list of selected nodes. The function adds the selected nodes to the list and prints the list. The function then calls itself with the remaining nodes and the same number of nodes to select. The function continues this until the number of selected nodes is equal to the number of nodes to select. The function then prints the number of nodes and the lists of selected nodes.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code execution given the input 3 would be:

Yes
2
1 1
1 1

This means that a binary tree of 3 nodes can be formed with 2 nodes. The tree is a single node. The edges of the tree are represented as pairs of integers. The first integer is the parent node, and the second integer is the child node. In this case, both parent and child nodes are 1, indicating that there is only one node in the tree.
