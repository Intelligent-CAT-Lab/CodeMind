The given code is a Java program that calculates the sum of all numbers that can be formed by using the digits of the input number. The input number is given as a string of digits.

Here's how the code works:

1. The input string is converted into an array of integers, where each integer is a digit of the input number.

2. The code then generates all possible binary strings of length `n-1`, where `n` is the number of digits in the input number.

3. For each binary string, it generates a number by concatenating the digits of the input number in the order specified by the binary string.

4. The sum of all generated numbers is calculated and added to the total sum.

5. The total sum is printed as the output.

Given the input `125`, the code will generate the following numbers:

- `125`
- `12*10+5` = 125
- `1*100+25` = 125
- `125`
- `1*100+25` = 125
- `12*10+5` = 125
- `125`

The sum of these numbers is `125 + 125 + 125 + 125 + 125 + 125 = 750`.

So, the output of the code execution for the input `125` is `750`.

Here's the output:

```
750
```

This output is based on the analysis of the code and the input `125`.
