The given Java code is a solution to a problem where we are given an integer n and we need to find the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements such that the sum of the elements is divisible by n. The code uses the concept of combinatorics and modular arithmetic to solve this problem.

The code starts by reading an integer n from the standard input. It then calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements such that the sum of the elements is divisible by n. The calculation is done using the combination function, which calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from n elements. The result is then printed to the standard output.

The code uses the FastReader class to read the input from the standard input. The FastReader class uses a BufferedReader to read lines from the standard input and a StringTokenizer to split the lines into tokens. The nextInt method reads an integer from the standard input.

The solve method calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements such that the sum of the elements is divisible by n. The calculation is done using the combination function and the power method. The combination function calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from n elements.
