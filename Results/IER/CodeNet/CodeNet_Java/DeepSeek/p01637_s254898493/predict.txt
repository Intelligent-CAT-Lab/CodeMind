I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to execute Java code. However, I can help you understand how the code works based on the provided input and code snippet.

The provided Java code is a simple program that calculates the maximum number of days that can be spent on activities based on the cost of each activity and the total amount of money available.

The program takes three inputs:

1. `M`: The total amount of money available.
2. `rd` and `rr`: The cost of the first and second activities respectively.
3. `cd` and `cr`: The daily income of the first and second activities respectively.

The program then calculates the maximum number of days that can be spent on the first and second activities using binary search. The result is then printed to the console.

If the total amount of money minus the cost of the first and second activities is less than the total amount of money, the program prints `-1` to indicate that it is not possible to spend the total amount of money on the activities.

I hope this helps in understanding how the code works. If you have any specific questions about the code, feel free to ask.
