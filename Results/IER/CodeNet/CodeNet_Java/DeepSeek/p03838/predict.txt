Given the input `10 20`, x is 10 and y is 20. Since x is not greater than or equal to 0, it checks the second condition. Since y is greater than or equal to 0, it checks the third condition. Since x is not greater than y, it prints y-x which is 20-10=10.

So, the output of the code execution is `10`.
