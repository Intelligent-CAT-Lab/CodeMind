:
I'm sorry, but I can't provide the output for the code execution because you didn't provide any input. The code you provided is a Java program that reads a string from the input and checks if there are any repeating characters in the string that are within 3 positions of each other. If such a pair is found, it prints the positions of the first and the second occurrence. If no such pair is found, it prints "-1 -1".

To get the output, you need to provide an input to the program. The input should be a string of lowercase letters. For example, if you provide the input "needed", the program will check if there are any repeating characters in the string that are within 3 positions of each other.

Please provide the input and I'll be able to help you analyze the code and provide the output.
