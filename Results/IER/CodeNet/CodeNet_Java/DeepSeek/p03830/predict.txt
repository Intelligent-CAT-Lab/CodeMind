The output of the code will depend on the input. For example, if the input is 3, the output will be 12. This is because the prime factors of 2, 3, and 4 are 2, 3, and 2, respectively. The number of distinct prime factors for 2 is 1 (2), for 3 is 2 (2 and 3), and for 4 is 3 (2, 2, and 2). So, the total number of distinct prime factors is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. But since the code is taking modulo 1000000007, the output is 12.
