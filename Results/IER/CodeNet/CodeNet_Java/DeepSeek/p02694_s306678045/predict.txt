The output of the code will be the number of times `h` increased by 1% before it became greater than or equal to `X`. In this case, `X` is `103`. The code will calculate this number and print it.

The calculation is as follows:

- Initially, `h` is `100` and `X` is `103`.
- The first time the loop runs, `h` becomes `101` and `count` becomes `1`.
- The next time the loop runs, `h` becomes `102.01` and `count` becomes `2`.
- The next time the loop runs, `h` becomes `103.0201` and `count` becomes `3`.
- Now `h` is greater than `X`, so the loop stops.

So the output of the code will be `3`.
