The provided Java code is a solution for a problem related to parsing and interpreting a string of characters. The string represents a series of parentheses and dashes, which are used to control a counter. The counter increases whenever it encounters an open parenthesis, and decreases whenever it encounters a closed parenthesis. The counter's value is added to the total sum whenever the counter changes. If the counter goes negative, it is reset to zero. If the string contains a dash, the last valid state of the counter is restored.

Given the input `(()())---)`, the code will process the string character by character. The output will be the running total of the counter at each step.

Analysis:

1. The input string `(()())---)` is read character by character.
2. If the character is '(', the counter increases by 1 and the new counter value is added to the total sum.
3. If the character is ')', the counter decreases by 1. If the counter goes negative, it is reset to zero. The new counter value is added to the total sum.
4. If the character is '-', the last valid state of the counter is restored. This is done by popping the last state from the `oldStates` stack and running the corresponding undo operation from the `undo` stack.
5. The current total sum is printed after each operation.

Output:

The output of the code will be a series of numbers, each representing the running total of the counter at each step of the input string. The output for the input `(()())---)` would be:

```
1
2
2
1
2
2
1
0
0
0
```

This output indicates that the counter started at 1, increased to 2, then decreased to 1, then increased to 2, then decreased to 2, then increased to 1, then decreased to 0, then reset to 0, and finally reset to 0.

Please note that the output might vary depending on the specific implementation of the code.
