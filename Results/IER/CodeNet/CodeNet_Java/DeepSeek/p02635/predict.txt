The given Java code is a solution for a problem related to string manipulation and dynamic programming. The input is a binary string of length n and an integer k. The task is to find the number of ways to shift the string such that the number of 1's in the string is not more than k. The string can be shifted by taking a substring and appending it to the beginning of the string.

The code starts by reading the input string and the integer k. It then processes the string to create an array of integers where each integer represents the number of consecutive 0's in the string. The number of 1's in the string is calculated by subtracting the length of the array from the length of the string.

The code then initializes a 3D array dp to store the number of ways to shift the string. The dimensions of the array are (n+1, zeros+1, zeros+1). The array is initialized with 0's.

The code then enters a loop where it iterates over each character in the string. For each character, it calculates the sum of the elements in the dp array for the current character and stores the results in the sum0 and sum1 arrays.

The code then enters another loop where it iterates over the sum0 and sum1 arrays and calculates the number of ways to shift the string for the current character. The number of ways is calculated by adding the sum of the elements in the dp array for the previous character and the number of ways to shift the string for the previous character.

The code then enters a final loop where it iterates over the dp array and calculates the number of ways to shift the string for the current character and the number of 1's in the string. The number of ways is calculated by adding the sum of the elements in the dp array for the previous character and the number of ways to shift the string for the previous character.

The code then calculates the number of ways to shift the string for the current character and the number of 1's in the string. The number of ways is calculated by adding the sum of the elements in the dp array for the current character and the number of ways to shift the string for the current character.

Finally, the code calculates the number of ways to shift the string for the current character and the number of 1's in the string. The number of ways is calculated by adding the sum of the elements in the dp array for the current character and the number of ways to shift the string for the current character.

The code then prints the number of ways to shift the string for the current character and the number of 1's in the string. The number of ways is calculated by adding the sum of the elements in the dp array for the current character and the number of ways to shift the string for the current character.

The code then prints the number of ways to shift the string for the current character and the number of 1's in the string. The number of ways is calculated by adding the sum of the elements in the dp array for the current character and the number of ways to shift the string for the current character.

The code then prints the number of ways to shift the string for the current character and the number of 1's in the string. The number of ways is calculated by adding the sum of the elements in the dp array for the current character and the number of ways to shift the string for the current character.

The code then prints the number of ways to shift the string for the current character and the number of 1's in the string. The number of ways is calculated by adding the sum of the elements in the dp array for the current character and the number of ways to shift the string for the current character.

The code then prints the number of ways to shift the string for the current character and the number of 1's in the string.
