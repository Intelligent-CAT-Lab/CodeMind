The code first generates a list of prime numbers up to 55555 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. It then filters this list to include only those numbers that end in 1. The input number is taken from the user and is used to print the first 'n' prime numbers that end in 1.

The code then creates a sublist of the prime numbers that end in 1, up to the input number. It converts each of these numbers to a string and joins them together with spaces to form a single string. This string is then printed as the output.

The input number is taken from the user and is used to print the first 'n' prime numbers that end in 1.

The code uses Java's Stream API to perform these operations. The Stream API provides a way to perform complex data processing queries on collections of objects.

The code uses the `filter` method to select only the prime numbers that end in 1. The `collect` method is used to convert the stream of prime numbers to a list. The `map` method is used to convert each prime number to a string. The `joining` method is used to join the strings together with spaces.

The code uses the `subList` method to create a sublist of the prime numbers that end in 1, up to the input number.

The code uses the `nextInt` method to read the input number from the user.

The code uses the `println` method to print the output.
