I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm unable to execute Java code. However, I can provide you with an analysis of the code you provided.

The code you provided is a Java program that reads a number `n` from the input, followed by `n` strings. It then processes these strings to find the minimum length of a string chain that can be formed by concatenating the strings in such a way that no string is a substring of another.

The code uses a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. It first creates a list of strings that do not appear as substrings of any other string. Then it calculates the cost of appending one string to another. The cost is the length of the string to be appended.

The code then uses a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum length of a string chain. It initializes the `dp` array with a large value (`INF`). For each string, it sets the cost of including that string in the chain to be the length of the string itself. Then it iteratively updates the `dp` array based on the current state and the next state. The next state is calculated by including the next string in the chain. The cost of the next state is the current cost plus the cost of appending the current string to the next string.

Finally, it finds the minimum cost of including all strings in the chain by iterating over the `dp` array and finding the minimum cost for each state. The minimum cost is the answer to the problem.

Unfortunately, I can't provide the output of the code execution for the given input `3` because I'm unable to execute Java code.

Please provide the input and I'll be able to help you analyze it.
