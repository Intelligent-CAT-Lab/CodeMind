The output of the program for the input `12` would be `4`.

This is because `12!!` (the double factorial of `12`) is calculated as follows:

```
12 / 2 = 6
6 / 5 = 1
1 / 5 = 0
```

So `12!! = 6 + 1 = 7`. However, the problem states that the output should be `4`. This discrepancy is likely due to a mistake in the calculation or in the provided input.
