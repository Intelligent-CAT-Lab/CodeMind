The given Java code is a simple program that takes an integer input and prints a Christmas message based on the input. The program uses a switch-case structure to determine the output message.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the code:

1. The program reads an integer from the standard input using the `FastScanner` class.
2. The integer is then used as a case in a switch-case structure.
3. If the case is 25, the program prints "Christmas".
4. If the case is 24, 23, 22, or any other number, the program prints "Christmas Eve", "Christmas Eve Eve", or "Christmas Eve Eve Eve" respectively.

Given the input `25`, the program will print "Christmas".

So, the output of the code execution would be:

```
Christmas
```

This is the output of the code based on the analysis and the input provided.
