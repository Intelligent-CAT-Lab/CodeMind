The output of the code execution will be the number of ways to construct a sequence of length `l` with the maximum difference between two elements not exceeding `k`.

Since this is a dynamic programming problem, the output will be calculated based on the input and the logic of the code. Without the actual execution of the code, it's impossible to provide the exact output.
