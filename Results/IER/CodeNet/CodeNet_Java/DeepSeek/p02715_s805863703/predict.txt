The output of the code will depend on the input values of N and K. It will calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N that are divisible by K.

For the input `3 2`, the output would be 10. The numbers divisible by 2 are 2 and 4, and their sum is 6. The numbers divisible by 3 are 3 and 6, and their sum is 9. The sum of these two sums is 15, but since we are considering numbers from 1 to 3, we subtract 3 (which is not divisible by 2 or 3) to get 10.
