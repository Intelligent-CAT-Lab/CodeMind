The output of the program will be the area of the triangle.

For the input `3 4 5`, the program will calculate the area as follows:
- The angle in radians is `5 * (Math.PI / 180)`.
- The area is calculated as `0.5 * 3 * 4 * sin(5 * (Math.PI / 180))`.
- The calculated area is printed as the output.

The output of the program will be the area of the triangle.
