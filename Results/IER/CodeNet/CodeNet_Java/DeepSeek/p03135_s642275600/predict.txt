The code takes two integer inputs from the user. The first input is stored in the variable `t` and the second input is stored in the variable `x`. Then it calculates the division of `t` by `x` and stores the result in the variable `d`. The division is performed as a floating point division because the dividend `t` is a floating point number.

The `nextInt()` method of the `Scanner` class is used to read the integer inputs from the user. The `System.in` is passed to the `Scanner` constructor to read the input from the standard input stream.

The result of the division is printed to the standard output using the `System.out.println()` method.

The division operation is performed using the `/` operator.

The `1.0*t` is used to ensure that the division is performed as a floating point division because `t` is an integer and the result of the division will be a floating point number.

The `d` variable is declared as a double to store the result of the division.

The `*` operator is used to perform the multiplication.

The `=` operator is used to assign the values to the variables.

The `.` operator is used to access the members of the classes.
