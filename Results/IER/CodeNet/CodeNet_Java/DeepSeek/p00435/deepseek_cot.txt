### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
class Main{public static void main(String[]z){String s="";for(char c:new java.util.Scanner(System.in).next().toCharArray())s+=(char)((c-42)%26+65);System.out.println(s);}}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `MRL`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Java code takes an input string, converts each character to ASCII, subtracts 42 from it, then takes modulo 26 to ensure the result is within the range of uppercase alphabets (A-Z), and finally adds 65 to bring it back to the range of uppercase alphabets. The result is then converted back to a character and appended to the output string. This process is repeated for each character in the input string.

Given the input `MRL`, the code will perform the following steps:
1. Convert `M` to ASCII (77), subtract 42 (35), take modulo 26 (1), add 65 (66), and convert back to character ('B').
2. Convert `R` to ASCII (82), subtract 42 (38), take modulo 26 (4), add 65 (69), and convert back to character ('E').
3. Convert `L` to ASCII (76), subtract 42 (34), take modulo 26 (2), add 65 (67), and convert back to character ('C').

So the output string will be `BEC`.

<<<Output>>>
BEC
