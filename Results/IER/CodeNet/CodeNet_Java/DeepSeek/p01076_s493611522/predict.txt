The output of the program will be the number of pairs of integers in the range from 1 to `N` that are at least `D` apart.

For the input `4 3`, the output would be `10`. This is calculated as follows:

- If `D` is 1, the number of pairs of integers in the range from 1 to 4 that are at least 1 apart is `4 * 3 / 2 = 6`.
- If `D` is not 1, the number of pairs of integers in the range from 1 to 4 that are at least 3 apart is `(4 - 3) * ((4 - 3) - 1) / 2 + 2 * (4 - 3) + 3 - 2 = 10`.

So, the output of the program for the input `4 3` is `10`.
