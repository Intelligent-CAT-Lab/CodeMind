<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input. The variable pow is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to 3. In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current integer i by multiplying the current value of pow with i and then taking the modulus with MOD (which is 1000000007).
In the first iteration, i is 1, so pow becomes (1 * 1) % 1000000007 = 1.
In the second iteration, i is 2, so pow becomes (1 * 2) % 1000000007 = 2.
In the third iteration, i is 3, so pow becomes (2 * 3) % 1000000007 = 6.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of pow as output, which is 6.
