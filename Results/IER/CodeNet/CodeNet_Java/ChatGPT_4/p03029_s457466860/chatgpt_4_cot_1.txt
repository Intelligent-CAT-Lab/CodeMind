<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, a and p, from the input. According to the given input, a is assigned the value 1 and p is assigned the value 3.

The Scanner object is then closed as it is no longer needed.

The value of p is updated by the expression a * 3 + p. Since a is 1 and p is 3, the expression evaluates to 1 * 3 + 3, which equals 6.

Finally, the code prints the result of p / 2 to the standard output. Since p is now 6, p / 2 equals 3.

Therefore, the output of the code will be 3.
