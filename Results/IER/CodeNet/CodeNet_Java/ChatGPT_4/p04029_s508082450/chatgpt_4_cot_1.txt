The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3. In each iteration, it adds the current loop index i to the variable sum.
In the first iteration, i is 1, so sum becomes 0 + 1 = 1.
In the second iteration, i is 2, so sum becomes 1 + 2 = 3.
In the third iteration, i is 3, so sum becomes 3 + 3 = 6.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of sum as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
