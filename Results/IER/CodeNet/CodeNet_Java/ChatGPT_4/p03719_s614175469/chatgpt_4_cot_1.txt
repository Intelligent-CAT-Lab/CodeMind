<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three integers a, b, and c with the input values. The values of a, b, and c are set to 1, 3, and 2 respectively according to the input. It then checks if the value of c is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b. Since 2 is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3, the condition is true. Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
