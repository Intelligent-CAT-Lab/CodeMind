<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "1 3" is read and split into an array of strings ["1", "3"] using the split method with the regex "\\s+" which matches any whitespace characters.
The first element of the array is parsed into an integer and stored in variable A, which becomes 1.
The second element of the array is parsed into an integer and stored in variable P, which becomes 3.
The expression (P+3*A)/2 is then evaluated. Substituting the values of A and P, we get (3+3*1)/2 which simplifies to (3+3)/2 and then to 6/2.
The result of the expression is 3, which is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
3
