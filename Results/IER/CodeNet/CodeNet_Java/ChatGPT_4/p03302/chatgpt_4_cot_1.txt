<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input. In this case, a is 4 and b is 11.

Next, the code checks if the sum of a and b equals 15. Since 4 + 11 equals 15, the condition is true.

Because the first condition is true, the code will execute the first branch of the if-else statement and print "+" to the standard output.

The code will not check the other conditions since the first condition was met and the corresponding action was taken.
