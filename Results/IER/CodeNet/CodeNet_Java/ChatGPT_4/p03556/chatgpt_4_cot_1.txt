<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer from the input, which is `10`. It then calculates the square root of this number using `Math.sqrt(scanner.nextInt())`, which results in approximately `3.1622776601683795`. This result is then cast to an `int`, which truncates the decimal part and results in `3`. The code then calculates the square of this integer (`3 * 3`) and prints the result, which is `9`.
<<<Output>>>
9
