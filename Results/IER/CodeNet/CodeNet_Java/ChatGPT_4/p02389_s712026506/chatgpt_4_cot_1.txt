<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input, which are provided as 3 and 5 respectively.

The next line creates a String object named res, which is initialized with the result of the multiplication of a and b, converted to a String. In this case, a * b is 3 * 5, which equals 15, so res is initialized with "15".

The code then appends a space to the res string using the += operator, so res becomes "15 ".

Next, it appends the result of the expression (2*a + 2*b) to res. The expression calculates the perimeter of a rectangle with sides a and b. For a = 3 and b = 5, the perimeter is 2*3 + 2*5, which equals 6 + 10, and thus 16. So now res becomes "15 16".

Finally, the code prints the value of res to the standard output, which is "15 16".
