The variables base and K are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 1.
The outer while loop will continue to execute as long as base is greater than or equal to 1.

In the first iteration of the outer while loop:
- The variables low and high are initialized with 0 and 4 respectively.
- The inner while loop will continue to execute as long as the difference between high and low is greater than 1.
- In the first iteration of the inner while loop:
  - willNext is calculated as (0 + 4) / 2 = 2.
  - The condition 2 <= 2 * (4 - 2) is true, so low is updated to 2.
- In the second iteration of the inner while loop:
  - willNext is calculated as (2 + 4) / 2 = 3.
  - The condition 3 <= 2 * (4 - 3) is false, so high is updated to 3.
- The inner while loop exits because high - low is no longer greater than 1.
- next is set to the value of low, which is 2.
- Since next is greater than 0, base is updated to 2 and ans is incremented to 2.

In the second iteration of the outer while loop:
- The variables low and high are initialized with 0 and 2 respectively.
- The inner while loop will continue to execute as long as the difference between high and low is greater than 1.
- In the first iteration of the inner while loop:
  - willNext is calculated as (0 + 2) / 2 = 1.
  - The condition 1 <= 2 * (2 - 1) is true, so low is updated to 1.
- The inner while loop exits because high - low is no longer greater than 1.
- next is set to the value of low, which is 1.
- Since next is greater than 0, base is updated to 1 and ans is incremented to 3.

In the third iteration of the outer while loop:
- The variables low and high are initialized with 0 and 1 respectively.
- The inner while loop will not execute because high - low is not greater than 1.
- next is set to the value of low, which is 0.
- Since next is not greater than 0, the outer while loop breaks.

The final value of ans is 3, which is printed as the output.
