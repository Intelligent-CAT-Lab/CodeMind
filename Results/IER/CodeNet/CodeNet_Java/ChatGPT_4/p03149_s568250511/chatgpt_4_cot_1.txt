The main method calls the solve() method. Inside the solve() method, a boolean array 'ok' of size 114514 is created and initialized to false. Then, four calls to nei() method are made, which reads four integers from the input. For each integer read, the corresponding index in the 'ok' array is set to true.

The input provided is `1 7 9 4`. Therefore, ok[1], ok[7], ok[9], and ok[4] are set to true.

After setting the respective indices to true, the solve() method checks if ok[1], ok[9], ok[7], and ok[4] are all true. Since the input provided sets all these indices to true, the condition is satisfied.

Finally, the ternary operator returns "YES" if the condition is true, otherwise it would return "NO". Since the condition is true, "YES" is passed to the out() method, which prints the result.

Therefore, the output of the code execution will be "YES".
