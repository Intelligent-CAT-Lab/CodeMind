The input provided is `3 310779401`, which initializes `n` with `3` and `m` with `310779401`. The `ModMath` class is instantiated with `m` to perform modular arithmetic.

The `solve` method of `FRedBlackSoulGem` class is called with these values. The `ans` variable is initialized to `0`.

The `Exponentiation` class is instantiated with base `2` and max `n` which is `3`. This will precompute powers of `2` modulo `m` up to `2^2`.

The for loop iterates with `r` from `1` to `n-1` (i.e., `1` to `2`), and calculates the number of ways to choose `r` red gems from `n` gems using the `ncr` method of `ModMath` class.

For each `r`, it calculates `t` as follows:
- `t` is initialized with the number of combinations of `n` taken `r` at a time, `mod.ncr(n, r)`.
- `t` is then multiplied by `2` raised to the power of `r * (r - 1) / 2`, which is the number of ways to arrange `r` red gems.
- `t` is then multiplied by `2` raised to the power of `b * (b - 1) / 2`, which is the number of ways to arrange `b` black gems.

Next, it calculates `p` which is the sum of the number of ways to arrange the remaining `b` black gems in a sequence such that there are `r` red gems between each pair of black gems. This is done using a nested loop that iterates over `i` from `0` to `b`, and uses the `ncr` method to calculate the number of combinations and the `pow` method to calculate the power of `2` raised to the number of ways to arrange the remaining black gems.

The result `p` is then adjusted to ensure it is non-negative by adding `m` if `p` is negative.

Finally, `t` is multiplied by `p` and taken modulo `m`, and added to the `ans` variable.

After the loop, the final `ans` is printed using the `LightWriter` class.

Let's calculate the output step by step:

- For `r = 1`, `b = 2`:
  - `t = mod.ncr(3, 1) * mod.pow(2, 1 * (1 - 1) / 2) * mod.pow(2, 2 * (2 - 1) / 2) % m`
  - `t = 3 * 1 * 2 % 310779401`
  - `t = 6`
  - `p = fact.ncr(2, 0) * mod.pow(exp2.pow(2 - 0) - 1, 1) % m - fact.ncr(2, 1) * mod.pow(exp2.pow(2 - 1) - 1, 1) % m + fact.ncr(2, 2) * mod.pow(exp2.pow(2 - 2) - 1, 1) % m`
  - `p = 1 * (4 - 1) - 2 * (2 - 1) + 1 * (1 - 1)`
  - `p = 3 - 2 + 0`
  - `p = 1`
  - `t *= p`
  - `t = 6 * 1 % 310779401`
  - `t = 6`
  - `ans += t`
  - `ans = 6`

- For `r = 2`, `b = 1`:
  - `t = mod.ncr(3, 2) * mod.pow(2, 2 * (2 - 1) / 2) * mod.pow(2, 1 * (1 - 1) / 2) % m`
  - `t = 3 * 2 * 1 % 310779401`
  - `t = 6`
  - `p = fact.ncr(1, 0) * mod.pow(exp2.pow(1 - 0) - 1, 2) % m - fact.ncr(1, 1) * mod.pow(exp2.pow(1 - 1) - 1, 2) % m`
  - `p = 1 * (2 - 1)^2 - 1 * (1 - 1)^2`
  - `p
