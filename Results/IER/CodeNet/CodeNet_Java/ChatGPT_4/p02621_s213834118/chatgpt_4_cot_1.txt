<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer from the input, which is `2`. It assigns this value to the variable `a`. Then it calculates the expression `a + (a * a) + (a * a * a)`. For the given input `2`, the calculation would be `2 + (2 * 2) + (2 * 2 * 2)`, which simplifies to `2 + 4 + 8`. The sum of these numbers is `14`. The code then prints the result of this calculation.
<<<Output>>>
14
