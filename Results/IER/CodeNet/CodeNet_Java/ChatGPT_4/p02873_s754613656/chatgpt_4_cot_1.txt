<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with `<>>`. The length of the string `n` is 3. An integer array `a` of size `n + 1` (which is 4) is created and initialized with all zeros.

The first for loop iterates over the characters of the string `s`. It checks for the character '<' and updates the array `a` accordingly. The array `a` is updated to ensure that each position after a '<' character is at least one greater than the previous position. After the first loop, the array `a` looks like this: [0, 1, 0, 0].

The second for loop iterates over the characters of the string `s` in reverse. It checks for the character '>' and updates the array `a` accordingly. The array `a` is updated to ensure that each position before a '>' character is at least one greater than the next position. After the second loop, the array `a` looks like this: [0, 1, 2, 1].

Finally, the `out.printLine(ArrayUtils.sumArray(a))` statement calculates the sum of the array `a` and prints it. The sum of the array `a` is 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.
