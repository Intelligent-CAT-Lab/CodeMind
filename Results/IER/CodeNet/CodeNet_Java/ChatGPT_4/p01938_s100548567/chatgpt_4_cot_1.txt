<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "AIZU" is converted to a character array `arr` with the characters 'A', 'I', 'Z', 'U'.
The variable `prev` is initialized with the character 'A', and `count` is initialized with 0.
The for-each loop iterates over each character in the array `arr`.

1. In the first iteration, `c` is 'A'. Since `prev` ('A') is not greater than or equal to `c` ('A'), `count` remains 0. `prev` is set to 'A'.
2. In the second iteration, `c` is 'I'. Since `prev` ('A') is less than `c` ('I'), `count` remains 0. `prev` is set to 'I'.
3. In the third iteration, `c` is 'Z'. Since `prev` ('I') is less than `c` ('Z'), `count` remains 0. `prev` is set to 'Z'.
4. In the fourth iteration, `c` is 'U'. Since `prev` ('Z') is greater than `c` ('U'), `count` is incremented by 1. `prev` is set to 'U'.

After the loop finishes, the final value of `count` is 1, which is printed as the output.
