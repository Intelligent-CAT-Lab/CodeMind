<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a sequence of words from the input and stores them in an array `s`. The `index` variable keeps track of the number of words read. The input words are "Thank", "you", "for", "your", "mail", "and", "your", "lectures".

An integer array `r` is created to store the frequency of each word, and a boolean array `flag` is used to mark whether a word has been counted already. The `flag` array is initially filled with `true`, indicating that all words are initially considered for counting.

The code then uses two nested loops to count the frequency of each word. If a word at position `i` is equal to a word at position `j` and the `flag[j]` is `true`, the frequency count for the word at position `i` is incremented, and `flag[j]` is set to `false` to prevent counting the same word again.

After counting the frequencies, the code finds the word with the maximum frequency (`max`) and its index (`maxin`). It then prints this word followed by a space.

Next, the code finds the longest word by comparing the lengths of all words in the input. It updates the `max` variable to hold the index of the longest word.

Finally, the code prints the longest word.

For the given input, the word frequencies are as follows:
- "Thank" - 1
- "you" - 1
- "for" - 1
- "your" - 2
- "mail" - 1
- "and" - 1
- "lectures" - 1

The word "your" has the highest frequency (2). The longest word is "lectures".
