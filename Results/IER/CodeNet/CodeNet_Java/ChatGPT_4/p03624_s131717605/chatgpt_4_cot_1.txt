<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a HashSet of Characters named `table` to store unique characters. It then reads a string from the input, which is "atcoderregularcontest".

The first for loop iterates over each character in the input string and adds it to the `table` set. Since a set only contains unique elements, any duplicate characters in the string are ignored.

After populating the set with characters from the input string, the code enters a second for loop that iterates from 'a' to 'z', checking for the first alphabet character that is not present in the `table` set.

The input string "atcoderregularcontest" contains the following unique characters: a, t, c, o, d, e, r, g, u, l, n, s. All characters from 'a' to 's' are present in the string.

The first character in the alphabet that is not present in the `table` set is 'b', as it does not appear in the input string.

The code then prints out the first missing character 'b' and returns, which means it exits the main method and the program terminates.

<<<Output>>>
b
