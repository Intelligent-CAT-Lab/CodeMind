<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables x, y, and z. The input provided is `3 4 5`, so x is assigned the value 3, y is assigned the value 4, and z is assigned the value 5. The code then calculates the product of x and y, which is 3 * 4 = 12, and divides it by 2, resulting in 12 / 2 = 6. The result of this calculation is printed to the console. The variable z is not used in the calculation. Therefore, the output will be the result of the expression (x * y) / 2, which is 6.
