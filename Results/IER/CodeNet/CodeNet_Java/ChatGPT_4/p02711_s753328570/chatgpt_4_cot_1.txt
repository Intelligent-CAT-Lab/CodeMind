<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "117". The variable `flag` is initialized with 0.
The code enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 2 (inclusive) to check each character of the string `s` at positions 0, 1, and 2.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at the current index `i` is '7'.
- When `i` is 0, `s.charAt(i)` is '1', so the condition is not met.
- When `i` is 1, `s.charAt(i)` is '1', so the condition is not met.
- When `i` is 2, `s.charAt(i)` is '7', so the condition is met, `flag` is set to 1, and the loop breaks.

After the loop, the code checks if `flag` is 1. Since `flag` was set to 1, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
