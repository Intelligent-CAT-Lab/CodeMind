<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate the equivalent resistance of two resistors connected in parallel. The input values `2` and `3` represent the resistance values of the two resistors, `r1` and `r2`, respectively.

The `LightScanner` class is used to parse the input, and the `LightWriter` class is used to format and output the result.

The `solve` method of the `AEquivalentResistance` class calculates the equivalent resistance using the formula for parallel resistors: `1 / (1 / r1 + 1 / r2)`. The `ans` method of the `LightWriter` class is then used to format the output to 10 decimal places.

Given the input `2 3`, the calculation proceeds as follows:
1. The reciprocal of `r1` is `1 / 2 = 0.5`.
2. The reciprocal of `r2` is `1 / 3 ≈ 0.3333333333`.
3. The sum of the reciprocals is `0.5 + 0.3333333333 ≈ 0.8333333333`.
4. The reciprocal of the sum is `1 / 0.8333333333 ≈ 1.2`.

The `ans` method rounds the result to 10 decimal places, so the final output should be `1.2000000000`.
