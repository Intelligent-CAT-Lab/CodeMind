<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "aba" is converted to a character array S with the elements {'a', 'b', 'a'}.
The length of S is 3, which is not even, so the boolean variable even is set to false.
The first character of S is 'a' and the last character of S is also 'a', so the boolean variable match is set to true.
The exclusive OR (XOR) operator (^) is applied to even and match, which evaluates to false ^ true, resulting in true.
Since the result of the XOR operation is true, the ternary operator selects the string "Second".
The program prints "Second".
<<<Output>>>
Second
