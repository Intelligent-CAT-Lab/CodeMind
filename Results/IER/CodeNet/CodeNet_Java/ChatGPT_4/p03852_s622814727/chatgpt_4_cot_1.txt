<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single line of input and stores it in the variable `intputString`. It then creates a `HashSet` called `vowelSet` and adds the strings "a", "e", "i", "o", and "u" to it, which represent the vowels in the English alphabet.

The code checks if the `intputString` is contained within the `vowelSet`. If it is, it prints "vowel". If it is not, it prints "consonant".

In this case, the input is `a`, which is a vowel and is contained in the `vowelSet`. Therefore, the code will print "vowel".
<<<Output>>>
vowel
