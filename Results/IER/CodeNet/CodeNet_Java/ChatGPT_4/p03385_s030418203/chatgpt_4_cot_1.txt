<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the console. It then reads a line of input and assigns it to the variable `string`. The input provided is "bac".

The boolean variable `b` is set to the result of checking whether the string contains the characters "a", "b", and "c". The `contains` method is used for this purpose, and it checks for the presence of each character individually.

Since the input string "bac" contains all three characters "a", "b", and "c", the boolean expression evaluates to true.

The ternary operator is then used to print "Yes" if `b` is true, and "No" if `b` is false.

Given that `b` is true, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
