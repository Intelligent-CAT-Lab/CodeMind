<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 7 according to the input.
The variable rest is calculated as the remainder of x divided by 11, which is 7 % 11 = 7.
The variable result is calculated as (x - rest) / 11, which is (7 - 7) / 11 = 0 / 11 = 0.
Then result is multiplied by 2, so result = 0 * 2 = 0.
Since rest is greater than 0, 1 is added to result, so result = 0 + 1 = 1.
Since rest is not greater than 6 (it is equal to 6), the second if condition is not executed.
The final value of result is 1, which is printed as the output.
