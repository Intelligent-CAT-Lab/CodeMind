<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class Main with a main method that creates an instance of Main and calls the doit method on it. The doit method reads input from the standard input using a Scanner object.

The input "BACD" is read and converted to a character array [B, A, C, D]. The code then enters a for loop to check if the character array contains the sequence "AC".

The for loop iterates over the character array, checking each character and the one following it. When the loop reaches the second character 'A' at index 1, it checks the next character 'C' at index 2 and finds that they form the sequence "AC".

Since the condition (c[i] == 'A' && c[i+1] == 'C') is met, the flag variable flg is set to true, and the loop breaks.

After the loop, the code checks the value of flg and prints "Yes" because flg is true, indicating that the sequence "AC" was found in the input.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
