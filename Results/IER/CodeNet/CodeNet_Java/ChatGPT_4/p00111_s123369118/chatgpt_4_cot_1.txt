<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to perform a two-step decoding process. The first step uses the `dec1` map to convert each character of the input string into a binary string. The second step uses the `dec2` map to convert the binary strings into their corresponding characters.

The input string is `?D-C'KOPUA`.

1. The first step iterates over each character of the input string and appends the corresponding binary string from `dec1` to `dec1Str`.
   - `?` -> `11111`
   - `D` -> `00011`
   - `-` -> `11101`
   - `C` -> `00010`
   - `'` -> `11110`
   - `K` -> `01010`
   - `O` -> `01110`
   - `P` -> `01111`
   - `U` -> `10100`
   - `A` -> `00000`
   After this step, `dec1Str` will be `111110001111101000101111001010100111101111101010000`.

2. The second step involves repeatedly checking if the beginning of `dec1Str` matches any key in `dec2`. If a match is found, the corresponding character is appended to `out`, and the matched part is removed from `dec1Str`. This process continues until no more matches can be found.

   - `11111` matches `?`, so `out` becomes `?` and `dec1Str` becomes `00011111010000101111001010100111101111101010000`.
   - `0001` matches `D`, so `out` becomes `?D` and `dec1Str` becomes `1111010000101111001010100111101111101010000`.
   - `11101` matches `-`, so `out` becomes `?D-` and `dec1Str` becomes `10000101111001010100111101111101010000`.
   - `100001` matches `C`, so `out` becomes `?D-C` and `dec1Str` becomes `01111001010100111101111101010000`.
   - `0111` matches `I`, so `out` becomes `?D-CI` and `dec1Str` becomes `1001010100111101111101010000`.
   - `100101` matches `A`, so `out` becomes `?D-CIA` and `dec1Str` becomes `010100111101111101010000`.
   - `0101` matches `C`, so `out` becomes `?D-CIAC` and `dec1Str` becomes `00111101111101010000`.
   - `0011` matches `T`, so `out` becomes `?D-CIACT` and `dec1Str` becomes `1101111101010000`.
   - `111` matches `P`, so `out` becomes `?D-CIACTP` and `dec1Str` becomes `01111101010000`.
   - `0111` matches `I`, so `out` becomes `?D-CIACTPI` and `dec1Str` becomes `1101010000`.
   - `1101` does not match any key in `dec2`, so the loop breaks.

The final value of `out` is `?D-CIACTPI`, followed by a newline character.
