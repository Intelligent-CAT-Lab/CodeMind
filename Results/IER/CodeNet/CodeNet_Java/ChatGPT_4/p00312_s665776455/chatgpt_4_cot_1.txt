<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, which are then parsed into integers D and L with the values 10 and 5 respectively. It then checks if D is divisible by L. Since 10 is divisible by 5, it enters the if condition and calculates the division of D by L, which is 10 / 5. The result of this division is 2. Since the if condition is met, the else block is not executed, and the program prints the result of the division, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
