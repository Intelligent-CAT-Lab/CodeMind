<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `1 1 3 4`, which corresponds to the variables a, b, c, and d respectively. The code then checks if a equals c or b equals d. Since neither of these conditions is true (1 does not equal 3, and 1 does not equal 4), the code proceeds to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the absolute differences between a and c, and b and d.

The absolute difference between a and c is |1 - 3| = 2.
The absolute difference between b and d is |1 - 4| = 3.

The gcd of 2 and 3 is calculated using the gcd function. Since 2 is not 0, it calls gcd(3 % 2, 2), which is gcd(1, 2). Then, since 1 is not 0, it calls gcd(2 % 1, 1), which is gcd(0, 1). Now, since the first argument is 0, it returns the second argument, which is 1. So, gcd(2, 3) is 1.

Finally, the code prints the sum of the absolute differences minus the gcd, which is (2 + 3 - 1) = 4.
