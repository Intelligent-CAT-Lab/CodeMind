The input string is "1817181712114". The length of the string n is 13. The character array c is created from the string.

The integer array d of size n+1 (14) is created to store the remainders of the numbers formed by the digits from the end of the string when divided by 2019.

The variable cur is initialized to 1, which is used to calculate the current power of 10 needed for the multiplication to get the number from the string.

The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will store the final count of the occurrences of numbers that are multiples of 2019.

The integer array f of size 2019 is created to store the frequency of the remainders when the numbers formed are divided by 2019. The frequency of the remainder 0 is initially set to 1 because a number with a remainder of 0 when divided by 2019 is a multiple of 2019.

The loop starts from the end of the string (index n-1 which is 12) and goes to the beginning (index 0). For each character in the string, the following steps are performed:

1. The digit is extracted by subtracting '0' from the character, multiplied by cur, and added to the next element in the array d (which initially is 0). This forms the number from the current digit to the end of the string.

2. The current value of cur is multiplied by 10 and then both cur and d[i] are taken modulo 2019 to keep them within the range and to get the remainder when the number formed is divided by 2019.

3. The frequency of the current remainder d[i] is added to ans, which counts the number of times a number with that remainder has been seen so far.

4. The frequency of the current remainder d[i] is then incremented by 1.

After the loop, the variable ans holds the total count of substrings that are multiples of 2019.

The output is the value of ans, which is printed by the PrintWriter.

Let's calculate the output step by step:

- For i=12 (last character '4'), d[12] = 4, cur = 10, d[12] %= 2019, cur %= 2019, ans += f[4] (initially 0), f[4]++.
- For i=11 ('1'), d[11] = 1*10 + 4 = 14, cur = 100, d[11] %= 2019, cur %= 2019, ans += f[14], f[14]++.
- For i=10 ('1'), d[10] = 1*100 + 14 = 114, cur = 1000, d[10] %= 2019, cur %= 2019, ans += f[114], f[114]++.
- ...
- Continue this process until i=0.

The final value of ans will be the output.
