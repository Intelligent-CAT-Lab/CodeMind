<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "erasedream" is read and stored in variable S. The code then sequentially replaces occurrences of "eraser", "erase", "dreamer", and "dream" with a hyphen ("-"). After each replacement, the resulting string is:

1. After replacing "eraser": "erasedream" (no occurrence of "eraser")
2. After replacing "erase": "dream" (one occurrence of "erase" at the beginning)
3. After replacing "dreamer": "dream" (no occurrence of "dreamer")
4. After replacing "dream": "-" (one occurrence of "dream")

After all replacements, the string S is "-". Then, the code replaces all hyphens with an empty string, resulting in an empty string S.

Since the length of S is now 0, the condition in the if statement is true, and the program prints "YES".

The commented-out section of the code is not executed as it is commented and therefore has no effect on the output.
