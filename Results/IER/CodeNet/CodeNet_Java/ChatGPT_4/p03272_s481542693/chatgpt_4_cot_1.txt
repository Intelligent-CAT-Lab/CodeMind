<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, n and i, from the input. According to the given input, n is assigned the value 4 and i is assigned the value 2.

The code then calculates the expression (n+1-i) which is (4+1-2) and evaluates to 3.

Finally, the result of the expression is printed to the standard output.
