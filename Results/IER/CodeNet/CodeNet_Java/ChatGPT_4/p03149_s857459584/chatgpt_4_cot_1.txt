<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object `sc` to read from standard input and a Printer object `pr` to write to standard output.

The `solve` method is called, which reads four integers `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, and `n4` from the input. In this case, the input is `1 7 9 4`.

An integer array `cnt` of size 10 is created to count the occurrences of each digit from 0 to 9. The array is indexed from 0 to 9, and all elements are initialized to 0.

The code increments the count of the corresponding index in the `cnt` array for each of the four input numbers. After reading the input, the `cnt` array will have the following values:
- `cnt[1]` will be 1,
- `cnt[7]` will be 1,
- `cnt[9]` will be 1,
- `cnt[4]` will be 1,
- All other elements will remain 0.

The code then checks if the count of digits 1, 9, 7, and 4 is exactly 1. Since this condition is true for the given input, the code will print "YES".

Finally, the `Printer` object `pr` is closed, which flushes the output stream and prints the result to the console. The Scanner object `sc` is also closed.
