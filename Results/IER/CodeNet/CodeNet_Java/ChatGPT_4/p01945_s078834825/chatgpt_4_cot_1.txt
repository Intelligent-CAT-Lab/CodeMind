<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is `((*)())`. The code reads this string and splits it into an array of strings `str` where each element is a single character from the input string. The array `str` will look like this: ["(", "(", "*", ")", ")", "(", ")"].

The variables `ans` and `now` are initialized to 0. The code then enters a for loop that iterates over each character in the `str` array.

1. For the first character '(', `now` is incremented by 1, so `now` becomes 1.
2. For the second character '(', `now` is incremented by 1 again, so `now` becomes 2.
3. For the third character '*', the else condition is executed, and `ans` is set to the current value of `now`, which is 2.
4. For the fourth character ')', `now` is decremented by 1, so `now` becomes 1.
5. For the fifth character ')', `now` is decremented by 1 again, so `now` becomes 0.
6. For the sixth character '(', `now` is incremented by 1, so `now` becomes 1.
7. For the seventh character ')', `now` is decremented by 1, so `now` becomes 0.

The loop ends, and the final value of `ans` is 2, which was set when the '*' character was encountered. The program then prints the value of `ans`.
