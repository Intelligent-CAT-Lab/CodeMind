The variables W, H, and C are initialized with 10, 20, and 5 respectively according to the input. The variables a and b are initialized with the values of W and H, which are 10 and 20.

The code then enters a while loop that continues to execute as long as the remainder of a divided by b is not 0. This loop is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm.

The steps of the loop are as follows:
1. c = a, which means c = 10.
2. a = b, which means a = 20.
3. b = c % a, which means b = 10 % 20 = 10.

Since a % b (20 % 10) is now 0, the loop terminates. The GCD of W and H is the final value of b, which is 10.

The last line of the code calculates the number of squares with side length equal to the GCD that can fit into the original rectangle of size W by H, and then multiplies this by C. The calculation is as follows:
(W / b) * (H / b) * C = (10 / 10) * (20 / 10) * 5 = 1 * 2 * 5 = 10.

Therefore, the output of the code will be 10.
