<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with 3 and variable X is initialized with 7 according to the input.
The for loop starts with i = X - K + 1, which is 7 - 3 + 1 = 5, and ends with i = X + K - 1, which is 7 + 3 - 1 = 9.
The loop iterates over the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
For each iteration, it checks if i is not equal to X + K - 1 (which is 9). If it is not, it prints the value of i followed by a space. If it is, it prints the value of i followed by a newline.
The output will be the sequence of numbers from 5 to 9, inclusive, separated by spaces, with the last number followed by a newline.
<<<Output>>>
