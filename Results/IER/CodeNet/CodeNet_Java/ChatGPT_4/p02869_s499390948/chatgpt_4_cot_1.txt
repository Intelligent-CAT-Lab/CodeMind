<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `1 1`, which means N=1 and K=1.

The code first checks if `2 * K > N + 1`. Since `2 * 1` is not greater than `1 + 1`, it does not output -1 and continues.

Next, it checks if N is odd, which it is (`N & 1` equals 1). Therefore, it enters the first if block.

Inside this block, it calculates `n = N >> 1`, which is `1 >> 1` equal to 0.

Then it enters the first for loop, which runs from `i = 0` to `i <= n` (which is 0), so it will run only once.

Inside the loop, it calculates:
- `s = K + 2 * i` which is `1 + 2 * 0` equal to 1.
- `m = K + N + (n - i)` which is `1 + 1 + (0 - 0)` equal to 2.
- `l = K + 2 * N + i` which is `1 + 2 * 1 + 0` equal to 3.

It then writes these values to the output separated by spaces and followed by a newline.

Since `n` is 0, the second for loop does not execute.

The output is flushed and closed, resulting in the final output being the values of `s`, `m`, and `l` written to the output.
