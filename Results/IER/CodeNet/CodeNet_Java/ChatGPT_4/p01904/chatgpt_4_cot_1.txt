<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate the minimum area of a bounding box that can contain a set of points after rotating the points by some angle. The input `1` indicates that there is only one point in the set.

The main method starts by creating an instance of the IO class to handle input and output. It reads the first integer `n` which is `1` in this case, indicating there is only one point.

Arrays `sqi` and `sqj` are initialized to store the x and y coordinates of the squares, but since there is only one point, these arrays will not be filled with any meaningful values beyond the initial zero at index 0.

The `pp` array is created to store the vertices of the squares, but again, since there is only one point, this will only contain the vertices of a single point (which is essentially the point itself repeated four times).

The `convexHull` method is called to compute the convex hull of the points, but since there is only one point, the convex hull is just the point itself.

The `theta` array is supposed to store the angles of the edges of the convex hull, but with only one point, there are no edges, so this array will remain empty.

The code then attempts to find the minimum area of the bounding box by rotating the points and calculating the area at each angle. However, since there is only one point, the area is always zero, regardless of the rotation.

Finally, the code prints the minimum area found, which in this case will be zero, formatted to six decimal places.
