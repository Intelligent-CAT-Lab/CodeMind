<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes the variable ans with 0. It then creates a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in).
The variable n is assigned the value 3 and the variable k is assigned the value 2 based on the input provided.
The code then checks if k is equal to 1. Since k is 2, the condition is false, so it does not execute the if block and instead goes to the else block.
In the else block, ans is assigned the value of n - k, which is 3 - 2, resulting in 1.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 1.
