<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to determine whether a circle with radius r can fit inside a rectangle of width W and height H, without touching or crossing the rectangle's edges. The circle's center is at coordinates (x, y).

The input values are:
W (rectangle width) = 5
H (rectangle height) = 4
x (circle center x-coordinate) = 2
y (circle center y-coordinate) = 2
r (circle radius) = 1

The code checks if the circle is within the bounds of the rectangle by ensuring that:
- The x-coordinate of the circle's center minus the radius is greater than or equal to 0 (r <= x).
- The x-coordinate of the circle's center plus the radius is less than or equal to the width of the rectangle (x <= W - r).
- The y-coordinate of the circle's center minus the radius is greater than or equal to 0 (r <= y).
- The y-coordinate of the circle's center plus the radius is less than or equal to the height of the rectangle (y <= H - r).

For the given input, the conditions are checked as follows:
- r <= x: 1 <= 2 (true)
- x <= W - r: 2 <= 5 - 1 (true)
- r <= y: 1 <= 2 (true)
- y <= H - r: 2 <= 4 - 1 (true)

Since all conditions are true, the circle with radius 1 can fit inside the rectangle with the center at (2, 2) without touching or crossing the edges. Therefore, the program will output "Yes".
