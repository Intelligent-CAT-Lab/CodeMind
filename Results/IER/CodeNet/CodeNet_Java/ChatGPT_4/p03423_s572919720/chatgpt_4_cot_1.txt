<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with the `main` method and a `FastReader` class to read input efficiently. The `main` method reads an integer `n` using the `FastReader` class.

The input provided is `8`, so `n` is initialized with the value `8`.

The `if` statement checks if `n` is less than `3`. Since `8` is not less than `3`, the `else` block is executed.

Inside the `else` block, the code calculates `result` by dividing `n` by `3`. The division of `8` by `3` is `2` because integer division truncates the decimal part.

Finally, the code prints the value of `result`, which is `2`.
