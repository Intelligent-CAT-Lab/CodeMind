<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads a single string input using scanner.next(), which reads the input until the first whitespace character. Since the input is `happy,newyear,enjoy` without any whitespace, the entire string is read as one input.

The string `s` is then processed by the replaceAll method, which replaces all occurrences of the comma character `,` with a single space character ` `. The resulting string is `happy newyear enjoy`.

Finally, the modified string is printed to the standard output using System.out.println.

<<<Output>>>
happy newyear enjoy
