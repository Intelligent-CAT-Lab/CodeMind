<<<Analysis>>>
The input `1905` is read and stored in the variable `number_input`. The variable `number_upper` is calculated by dividing `number_input` by 100, which results in `19`. The variable `number_lower` is calculated by taking the remainder of `number_input` divided by 100, which results in `05`.

The program then checks the following conditions:
- If both `number_upper` and `number_lower` are between 1 and 12 (inclusive), it prints "AMBIGUOUS".
- If only `number_upper` is between 1 and 12 (inclusive), it prints "MMYY".
- If only `number_lower` is between 1 and 12 (inclusive), it prints "YYMM".
- If neither `number_upper` nor `number_lower` is between 1 and 12 (inclusive), it prints "NA".

In this case, `number_upper` is 19, which is not between 1 and 12, and `number_lower` is 5, which is between 1 and 12. Therefore, the condition for "YYMM" is met.

<<<Output>>>
YYMM
