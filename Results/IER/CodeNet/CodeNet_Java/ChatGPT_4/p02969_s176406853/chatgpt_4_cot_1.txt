<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable r, which is assigned the value 4 according to the input provided.

The code then calculates the expression 3*r*r, which is 3 times the square of r. Since r is 4, the square of r is 16, and 3 times 16 is 48.

Finally, the code prints the result of the calculation, which is 48, to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
48
