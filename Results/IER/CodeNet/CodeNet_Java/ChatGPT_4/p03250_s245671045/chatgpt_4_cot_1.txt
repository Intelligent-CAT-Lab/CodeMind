<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `a` of size 3 and then enters a for loop to read 3 integers from the input. According to the input, the array `a` is filled with the values 1, 5, and 2 respectively.

After reading the input, the code calls `Arrays.sort(a)` which sorts the array `a` in ascending order. The sorted array `a` will be `[1, 2, 5]`.

Finally, the code prints the result of the expression `a[2] * 10 + a[1] + a[0]`. Since `a[2]` is the largest number (5), `a[1]` is the second largest number (2), and `a[0]` is the smallest number (1), the expression evaluates to `5 * 10 + 2 + 1`, which equals `52`.

<<<Output>>>
52
