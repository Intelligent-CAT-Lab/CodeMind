<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that reads four integers from the standard input, sorts them, and then prints the absolute value of the difference between the sum of the first and last integers and the sum of the two middle integers.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the code execution with the given input `2 1 3 4`:

1. The `FastScanner` class is used to read the input. It reads four integers and stores them in an array `a` of size 4.
2. The input values are: `a[0] = 2`, `a[1] = 1`, `a[2] = 3`, `a[3] = 4`.
3. The array `a` is sorted using `Arrays.sort(a)`. After sorting, the array becomes: `a[0] = 1`, `a[1] = 2`, `a[2] = 3`, `a[3] = 4`.
4. The program calculates the absolute value of the expression `a[0] + a[3] - a[1] - a[2]`, which is `1 + 4 - 2 - 3 = 0`.
5. The absolute value of `0` is `0`, so the program prints `0`.
