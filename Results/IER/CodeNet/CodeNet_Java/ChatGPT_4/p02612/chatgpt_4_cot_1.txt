<<<Analysis>>>
The input `1900` is read and stored in the variable `n`. The variable `x` is then calculated as `n / 1000`, which is `1900 / 1000` resulting in `1`. The variable `y` is calculated as `n % 1000`, which is `1900 % 1000` resulting in `900`.

The code then checks if `y` is equal to `0`. Since `y` is `900`, the condition is false, so it proceeds to the else block.

Inside the else block, the code calculates `ans` as `1000 * (x + 1) - n`. Substituting the values, we get `1000 * (1 + 1) - 1900`, which simplifies to `2000 - 1900`, resulting in `100`.

The value of `ans` is then printed, which is `100`.
