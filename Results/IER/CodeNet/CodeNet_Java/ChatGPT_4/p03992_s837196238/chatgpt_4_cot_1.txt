<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `solve` method that takes a string `s` and prints the first four characters of the string followed by a space and then the rest of the string. The `run` method sets up a `FastScanner` to read input and a `PrintWriter` to write output, calls the `solve` method, and then closes the output.

The `FastScanner` class is designed to read tokens from an input source, which can be either a file or standard input. It uses a `BufferedReader` and a `StringTokenizer` to read and split the input into tokens.

The `main` method simply creates an instance of `Main` and calls the `run` method.

Given the input `CODEFESTIVAL`, the `solve` method will be called with `s` set to "CODEFESTIVAL". The `solve` method will then print "CODE FESTIVAL" because it takes the substring from index 0 to 4 (which is "CODE") and concatenates it with a space and the substring from index 4 to the end of the string (which is "FESTIVAL").

<<<Output>>>
CODE FESTIVAL
