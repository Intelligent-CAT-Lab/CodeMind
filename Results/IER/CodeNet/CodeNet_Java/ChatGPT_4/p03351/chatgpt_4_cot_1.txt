<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized with 4, 7, 9, and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable ab is calculated as the absolute difference between a and b, which is |4 - 7| = 3.
The variable ac is calculated as the absolute difference between a and c, which is |4 - 9| = 5.
The variable bc is calculated as the absolute difference between b and c, which is |7 - 9| = 2.
The if condition checks if ac is less than or equal to d, which is not true since 5 is not less than or equal to 3.
Then it checks if both ab is less than or equal to d and bc is less than or equal to d. Since both conditions are true (3 <= 3 and 2 <= 3), the if condition is satisfied.
Since the if condition is satisfied, "Yes" is printed.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
