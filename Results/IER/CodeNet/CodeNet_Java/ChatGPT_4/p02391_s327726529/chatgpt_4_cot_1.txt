<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input. The input provided is `1 2`, so a is initialized with 1 and b with 2.

The code then checks if a is less than b, which is true in this case (1 < 2). Therefore, it prints "a < b" to the standard output.

After printing, the Scanner object is closed with sc.close() to prevent resource leaks.

The code does not reach the other conditions (else if and else) because the first condition (if) is already satisfied and executed.

<<<Output>>>
a < b
