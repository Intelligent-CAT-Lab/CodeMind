<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `a` with a predefined set of integers. Then it creates a `Scanner` object `cin` to read input from the standard input stream (usually the keyboard). The code expects a single integer input, which is stored in the variable `k`.

The input provided is `6`. The code then accesses the element at index `k-1` in the array `a`, which corresponds to the 6th element in the array because array indices in Java are 0-based. The 6th element in the array `a` is `a[5]`, which has the value `2`.

After printing the value of the array element at index `k-1`, the code closes the `Scanner` object.

Therefore, the output will be the value `2`, which is the 6th element in the array `a`.
<<<Output>>>
2
