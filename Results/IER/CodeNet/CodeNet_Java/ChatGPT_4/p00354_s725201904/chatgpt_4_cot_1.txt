<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with the value 1 according to the input. The switch statement then evaluates X%7, which is 1%7, resulting in 1. The switch case then matches case 1, and the corresponding block of code is executed. It prints "fri" to the console. After printing, the break statement is encountered, which exits the switch statement. No other code is executed after the switch statement.
<<<Output>>>
