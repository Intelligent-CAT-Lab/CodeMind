<<<Analysis>>>
The input "1 2 +" is split into an array of strings ["1", "2", "+"]. The program then iterates over this array and processes each element using a switch statement and a stack to perform the operations.

1. The first element "1" is a number, so it is pushed onto the stack.
2. The second element "2" is also a number, so it is pushed onto the stack. Now the stack contains ["1", "2"].
3. The third element "+" is an operator. The program pops the two top elements from the stack, which are "2" and "1". It converts them to integers and adds them together, resulting in the integer 3.
4. The result of the addition (3) is converted back to a string and pushed onto the stack. Now the stack contains ["3"].
5. The loop ends as there are no more elements to process.
6. The final result is popped from the stack and printed. The stack contains the string "3", which is the result of the addition.

The output of the code will be the result of the addition, which is 3.
