The variables H and W are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input. The scanner is then closed as it is no longer needed.

The code checks if either H or W is equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints 1 and returns. Since neither H nor W is 1, the code proceeds to the next part.

The variable h is calculated as (H + 1) / 2, which is (4 + 1) / 2 = 2.5, but since h is an integer, it will be 2.

The variable ans is initialized as a long with a value of 0.

A for loop is set to iterate from 1 to W (1 to 5 in this case). Inside the loop, the code checks if the current column (i) is even and H is odd. If this condition is true, it adds h - 1 to ans. Otherwise, it adds h to ans.

The loop runs as follows:
- i = 1 (odd), ans += h (2), ans = 2
- i = 2 (even), ans += h (2), ans = 4
- i = 3 (odd), ans += h (2), ans = 6
- i = 4 (even), ans += h (2), ans = 8
- i = 5 (odd), ans += h (2), ans = 10

After the loop finishes, the final value of ans is 10, which is printed as the output.
