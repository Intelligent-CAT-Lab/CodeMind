<<<Analysis>>>
The input `4` is read and stored in the variable `l`. The variable `l` is then decremented by 1, resulting in `l = 3`.

The `solve` method initializes `crt` to 1 and creates an empty list of `Edge` objects named `edges`. It also sets `numNode` to 20.

The while loop will run as long as `l` is greater than or equal to 0 and `crt` is less than `numNode`. Inside the loop, the following steps occur:

1. If `l` is even (which is not the case here since `l` is 3), it would add an edge from `crt` to `numNode` with a cost of `l` and then decrement `l`.

2. Since `l` is odd, it is divided by 2, resulting in `l = 1`.

3. Two edges are added:
   - An edge from `crt` (1) to `crt + 1` (2) with a cost of 0.
   - An edge from `crt` (1) to `crt + 1` (2) with a cost of `l + 1` (2).

4. `crt` is incremented by 1, resulting in `crt = 2`.

The loop continues with `l = 1` and `crt = 2`:

1. `l` is still odd, so it is divided by 2 again, resulting in `l = 0`.

2. Two more edges are added:
   - An edge from `crt` (2) to `crt + 1` (3) with a cost of 0.
   - An edge from `crt` (2) to `crt + 1` (3) with a cost of `l + 1` (1).

3. `crt` is incremented by 1, resulting in `crt = 3`.

Now `l = 0` and `crt = 3`, the loop ends because `l` is no longer greater than or equal to 0.

The program then prints the number of nodes (`numNode`) and the size of the `edges` list, followed by the details of each edge in the `edges` list.

The output will be the number of nodes, which is 20, the number of edges, which is 4, and the details of each edge. The edges added are as follows:
- Edge from 1 to 2 with cost 0.
- Edge from 1 to 2 with cost 2.
- Edge from 2 to 3 with cost 0.
- Edge from 2 to 3 with cost 1.
