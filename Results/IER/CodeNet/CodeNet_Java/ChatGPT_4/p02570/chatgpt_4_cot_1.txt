<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input: `d`, `t`, and `s`. These are assigned the values 1000, 15, and 80 respectively.

The code then calculates the time `ans` it would take to cover the distance `d` at speed `s` using the formula `ans = d * 1.0 / s`. In this case, `ans = 1000 * 1.0 / 80`, which equals 12.5.

Next, the code checks if `ans` is less than or equal to `t`. Since `ans` (12.5) is less than `t` (15), the condition is true.

Because the condition is true, the code prints "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
