<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads three integers a, b, and c with the values 4, 5, and 3 respectively according to the input provided.

The code uses the Math.min and Math.max functions to find the smallest and largest numbers among a, b, and c. It first compares a and b to find the smaller one, then compares the result with c to find the smallest of all three. Similarly, it finds the largest number by first comparing a and b, and then comparing the result with c.

The smallest number among 4, 5, and 3 is 3, and the largest number is 5.

Finally, the code prints the smallest and largest numbers in the format "smallest largest" using System.out.println and String.format.

<<<Output>>>
