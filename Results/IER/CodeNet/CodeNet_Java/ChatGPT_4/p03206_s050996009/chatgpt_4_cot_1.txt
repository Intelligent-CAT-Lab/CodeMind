<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read from the standard input. It then reads an integer value into the variable 'day'. Given the input '25', the variable 'day' is set to 25. The switch statement then checks the value of 'day'. Since 'day' is 25, the case for 25 matches, and "Christmas" is printed to the standard output. After printing, the break statement exits the switch block, and the program ends without executing any other cases.
<<<Output>>>
Christmas
