<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 1` initializes the variables `b` and `w` with the values 2 and 1 respectively. The variable `n` is then calculated as the sum of `b` and `w`, which is 3.

The code then initializes two arrays `dpw` and `dpb` with a length of `n+1` (4 in this case), to store dynamic programming values for white and black respectively.

The `enumFIF` function is called to precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to 1,000,000, which are used to calculate combinations `C(n, r)` efficiently.

The `inv` array is initialized to store modular inverses of integers up to `n-1` (2 in this case). The value of `inv[2]` is calculated using the modular inverse formula.

The `inv_pow` array is initialized to store powers of `inv[2]` up to `n` (3 in this case). This is used to calculate the probabilities.

The code then prints the value of `inv[2]`, which is the modular inverse of 2 modulo `mod`.

A loop runs from 0 to `n-2` (1 in this case), updating the `dpw` and `dpb` arrays with the probabilities of ending with a white or black square respectively, using the combination formula and the precomputed inverses and powers.

For each iteration, the code calculates the answer as the average of 1 and the difference between `dpw[i+1]` and `dpb[i+1]`, adjusted for modular arithmetic, and prints it.

Since the input is `2 1`, the loop will run only once, and the output will be the initial value of `inv[2]` followed by the calculated answer for the first iteration.
