<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value from the input and stores it in the variable x. The value of x is set to 2 according to the input provided. The code then calculates the cube of x by multiplying x by itself three times (x*x*x). The result of this calculation is 8 (since 2*2*2 equals 8). Finally, the code prints the result to the standard output using System.out.println.
<<<Output>>>
8
