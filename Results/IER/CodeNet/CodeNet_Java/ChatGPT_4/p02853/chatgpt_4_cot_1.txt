<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X and Y are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The code then checks if both X and Y are equal to 1. Since this is true, it enters the first if condition and sets ans to 1000000.
The else block is skipped because the condition for the if statement was true.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 1000000.
<<<Output>>>
1000000
