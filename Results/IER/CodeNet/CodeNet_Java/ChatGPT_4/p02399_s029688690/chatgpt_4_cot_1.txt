<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then declares four variables: two integers a and b, an integer d for division result, an integer r for remainder, and a double f for floating-point division result.

The input provided is "3 2", so the integer variables a and b are assigned the values 3 and 2, respectively.

The code then performs the following operations:
- d = a/b calculates the integer division of a by b, which is 3 divided by 2, resulting in 1 because integer division truncates the decimal part.
- r = a%b calculates the remainder of a divided by b, which is 3 modulo 2, resulting in 1.
- f = (double)a/(double)b calculates the floating-point division of a by b, which is 3.0 divided by 2.0, resulting in 1.5.

The code then prints the results of these calculations. It prints the integer division result and the remainder separated by a space, followed by the floating-point division result formatted to 5 decimal places.

The output will be "1 1 1.50000" because:
- The integer division of 3 by 2 is 1.
- The remainder of 3 divided by 2 is 1.
- The floating-point division of 3 by 2 is 1.5, formatted to 5 decimal places is 1.50000.

Finally, the Scanner object is closed with sc.close().

<<<Output>>>
1 1 1.50000
