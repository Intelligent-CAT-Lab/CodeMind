<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then waits for an integer input from the user. Once the user inputs the integer `100`, the Scanner object reads this integer and assigns it to the variable `num`. The next line of code concatenates the string "ABC" with the value of `num` and prints it to the standard output. Therefore, the output will be the string "ABC" followed by the number `100`.
<<<Output>>>
ABC100
