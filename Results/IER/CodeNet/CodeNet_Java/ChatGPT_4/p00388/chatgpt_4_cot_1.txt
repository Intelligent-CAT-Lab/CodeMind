<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to count how many divisors of a given number H are within a range from A to B, inclusive. The variables H, A, and B are initialized with the values 100, 2, and 4 respectively according to the input.

The code then enters a for loop that iterates from A (2) to B (4). For each value i in this range, it checks if H (100) is divisible by i without any remainder using the modulus operator (%). If the condition is true, it increments the variable ans by 1.

- When i is 2, H % i equals 0, so ans is incremented to 1.
- When i is 3, H % i equals 1, so ans is not incremented.
- When i is 4, H % i equals 0, so ans is incremented to 2.

After the loop finishes, the program prints the final value of ans, which is 2, as the output.
