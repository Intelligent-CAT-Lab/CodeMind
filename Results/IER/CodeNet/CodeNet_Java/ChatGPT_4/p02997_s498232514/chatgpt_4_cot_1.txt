<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate and print a certain structure based on the input values N and K. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The SC class is a helper class for input operations. It reads the input and provides methods to parse integers, longs, doubles, and lines from the input stream.

2. The main method starts by creating an instance of SC to read two integers, N and K, from the input. In this case, N is 5 and K is 3.

3. The code then checks if the condition `(N-2)*(N-1)/2 < K` is true. For the input `5 3`, this condition evaluates to `(5-2)*(5-1)/2 < 3` which simplifies to `3*4/2 < 3` or `6 < 3`, which is false.

4. Since the condition is false, the code proceeds to calculate the value of `g` as `N-1 + (N-1)*(N-2)/2 - K`. For the input `5 3`, `g` is calculated as `5-1 + (5-1)*(5-2)/2 - 3` which simplifies to `4 + 4*3/2 - 3` or `4 + 6 - 3`, resulting in `g = 7`.

5. The code then prints the value of `g` using the `pl` method.

6. Next, the code calculates the value of `yokei` as `(N-1)*(N-2)/2 - K`. For the input `5 3`, `yokei` is `4*3/2 - 3` which simplifies to `6 - 3`, resulting in `yokei = 3`.

7. The code then enters a loop to print pairs of numbers. The first loop prints pairs where the second number is always N (5 in this case). It prints `1 5`, `2 5`, `3 5`, and `4 5`.

8. The second nested loop is used to print additional pairs of numbers, decrementing `yokei` each time a pair is printed. It prints pairs in the form of `i j` where `i` and `j` are loop indices and `i` is always greater than `j`. The loop runs until `yokei` reaches 0. For the input `5 3`, it prints `2 1`, `3 1`, and `3 2`.

9. The output consists of the value of `g` followed by the pairs printed in the loops.
