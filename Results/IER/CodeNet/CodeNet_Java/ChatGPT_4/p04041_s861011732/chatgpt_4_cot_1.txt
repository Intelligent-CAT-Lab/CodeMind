The input `3 5 7 5` initializes the variables n, x, y, and z with 3, 5, 7, and 5 respectively. The program is designed to calculate the number of ways to form a number of length n with the digits 1 to 10 such that the number contains at least one x, one y, and one z.

The `pow` array is initialized to store powers of 10 modulo `mod` (1000000007). It is filled with values 1, 10, 100, and 1000 for indices 0 to 3 respectively.

The `XYZ_MASK` is calculated using the input values for x, y, and z. It is a bitmask that represents the presence of x, y, and z in the number. For the given input, `XYZ_MASK` will be `1000000100000001000` in binary, which corresponds to the positions of z, y+z, and x+y+z in the bitmask.

The `dp` array is a 2D array used for dynamic programming to store intermediate results. It is initialized with -1 for all positions.

The `solve` function is called, which calculates the number of ways to form the number of length n with the required conditions. It uses the `sol` function recursively to compute the values.

The `sol` function checks if the current mask contains at least one x, one y, and one z by comparing it with `XYZ_MASK`. If the condition is met, it returns `pow[i]`. If `i` is 0, it returns 0 because there are no numbers of length 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of ways by trying to append each digit from 1 to 10 to the current number and updating the mask accordingly using the `merge` function.

The `merge` function shifts the mask left by the digit value, applies a bitmask to keep only the last 17 bits, and then sets the bit corresponding to the digit.

After the recursive calls, the final result is the value of `dp[n][0]`, which is the number of ways to form a number of length n with at least one x, one y, and one z.

For the given input `3 5 7 5`, the output will be the result of `sol(3, 0)`, which is the number of ways to form a number of length 3 with at least one 5, one 7, and one 5.

The exact number of ways is not trivial to calculate manually due to the complexity of the recursive function and the large number of possible combinations. However, the program will compute this number and print it as the output.
