<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `2`. The `InputReader` reads this value and assigns it to the variable `k`. The variable `n` is set to the minimum of `k` and `500`, which in this case is `2`.

The program then creates a 2D array `temp` with dimensions `n` by `n` (2x2). It enters a loop that will iterate twice, starting from index 1 and decrementing to 0.

In the first iteration (i = 1), since `i + 1` is equal to `k`, it does not enter the first inner if condition. Instead, it fills the entire row `temp[1]` with the value of `k` (which is 2), and then decrements `k` to 1.

In the second iteration (i = 0), `i + 1` is not less than `k` (since `k` is now 1), so it again fills the entire row `temp[0]` with the value of `k` (which is now 1), and then decrements `k` to 0.

The program then creates another 2D array `answer` with the same dimensions (2x2). It fills this array by rotating the `temp` array. For each cell in `answer`, it assigns the value from `temp` using the formula `temp[i][j]` to `answer[j][(i + j) % n]`.

After filling the `answer` array, the program prints the value of `n` (which is 2) followed by the contents of the `answer` array.

The `answer` array after rotation will look like this:
```
1 2
2 1
```

This is because the rotation formula `(i + j) % n` will result in the following mappings from `temp` to `answer`:
- `temp[0][0]` to `answer[0][0]`
- `temp[0][1]` to `answer[1][1]`
- `temp[1][0]` to `answer[0][1]`
- `temp[1][1]` to `answer[1][0]`

Finally, the `OutputWriter` prints the size of the matrix `n` followed by each row of the `answer` matrix.
