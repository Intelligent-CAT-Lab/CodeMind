<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a nested static class `Solver` that contains a variety of methods for input handling, mathematical computations, and utility functions. The `main` method of the `Main` class initializes a `Solver` object and calls its `solve` method.

The `solve` method calls `prtln` with the result of a ternary operation that checks if the character read from the input is a lowercase letter. It uses the `isLower` method, which checks if the character is between 'a' and 'z'. If the character is a lowercase letter, it prints "a"; otherwise, it prints "A".

Given the input `B`, the `isLower` method will return `false` because 'B' is an uppercase letter. Therefore, the ternary operation will evaluate to the "else" part, and the output will be "A".

A
