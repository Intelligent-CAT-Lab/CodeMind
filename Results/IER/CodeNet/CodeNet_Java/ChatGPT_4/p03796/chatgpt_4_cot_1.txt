The variable cnt is initialized with 3 according to the input. The variable power is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to calculate the factorial of the number 3 modulo (10^9 + 7).
In the first iteration (i = 1), power becomes (1*1) % (10^9 + 7) which is 1.
In the second iteration (i = 2), power becomes (1*2) % (10^9 + 7) which is 2.
In the third iteration (i = 3), power becomes (2*3) % (10^9 + 7) which is 6.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of power as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
