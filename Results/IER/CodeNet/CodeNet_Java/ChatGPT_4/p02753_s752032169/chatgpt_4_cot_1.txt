<<<Analysis>>>
The input "ABA" is read and stored in the variable S. The string S is then split into an array of strings word[] where each element contains a single character of the string S. So, word[0] = "A", word[1] = "B", and word[2] = "A".

The code then checks if the first three characters of the array word[] are all "A" or all "B". If either condition is true, it sets the result to "No". If neither condition is true, it sets the result to "Yes".

For the input "ABA", the first condition (word[0].equals("A") && word[1].equals("A") && word[2].equals("A")) is false because word[1] is "B". The second condition (word[0].equals("B") && word[1].equals("B") && word[2].equals("B")) is also false because word[0] and word[2] are "A". Since neither condition is met, the result is set to "Yes".

Finally, the result "Yes" is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
