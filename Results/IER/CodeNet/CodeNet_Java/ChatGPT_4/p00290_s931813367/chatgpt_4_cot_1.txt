<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then declares four integer variables: a, b, c, and sum. The variable c is declared but never used in the code.

The program reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables a and b. According to the given input, a is assigned the value 20 and b is assigned the value 2.

The program then calculates the product of a and b and assigns the result to the variable sum. In this case, sum will be the product of 20 and 2, which is 40.

Finally, the program prints the value of sum to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
40
