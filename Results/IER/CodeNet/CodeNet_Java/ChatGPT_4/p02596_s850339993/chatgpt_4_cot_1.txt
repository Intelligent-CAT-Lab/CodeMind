<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with 101 according to the input. The code first checks if K is even. Since 101 is odd, it skips the if block that prints -1 and returns.

The variable cur is initialized with 7, and the variable cnt with 1. The code enters a for loop that will iterate up to 100,000,000 times, but it will likely return before completing all iterations.

Inside the loop, the code checks if the current value of cur is divisible by K (101). If it is, the code prints the current value of cnt and returns. If not, it calculates a new value for cur by multiplying the current cur by 10, adding 7, and then taking the remainder when divided by K. The variable cnt is incremented by 1.

The loop continues until cur % K is 0. For the input 101, the loop will find that cur % K is 0 when cnt is 4. This is because:
- First iteration: cur = 7, cnt = 1, cur % K = 7 % 101 = 7 (not zero, continue)
- Second iteration: cur = (7 * 10 + 7) % 101 = 77 % 101 = 77, cnt = 2 (not zero, continue)
- Third iteration: cur = (77 * 10 + 7) % 101 = 777 % 101 = 68, cnt = 3 (not zero, continue)
- Fourth iteration: cur = (68 * 10 + 7) % 101 = 687 % 101 = 0, cnt = 4 (zero, print cnt and return)

Therefore, the output will be the value of cnt when cur % K first equals 0, which is 4.
