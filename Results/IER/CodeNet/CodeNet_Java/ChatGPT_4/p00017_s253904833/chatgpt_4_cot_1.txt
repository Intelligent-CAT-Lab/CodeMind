The input string is "xlmw mw xli tmgxyvi xlex m xsso mr xli xvmt."

The program first calls the getShift method with the input string to determine the shift value needed to decode the message. The getShift method splits the input string into words and tries to shift each word by all possible shift values from 0 to 25. It looks for the words "the", "this", or "that" to determine the correct shift value.

The first word "xlmw" is shifted by 0 to 25, but none of the shifts result in "the", "this", or "that". The same process is repeated for the second word "mw" and so on until the word "tmgxyvi" is reached. When "tmgxyvi" is shifted by 4, it becomes "the". Therefore, the shift value is determined to be 4.

Now that the shift value of 4 is known, the program iterates over each character of the input string and shifts it by 4 using the shiftWord method. The shiftWord method checks if the character is a lowercase letter (between 'a' and 'z'). If it is, it adds the shift value to the character. If the resulting character goes beyond 'z', it wraps around from 'a' again.

The entire input string is then shifted by 4 characters:
- 'x' becomes 'b'
- 'l' becomes 'p'
- 'm' becomes 'q'
- 'w' becomes 'a'
- 'm' becomes 'q'
- 'w' becomes 'a'
- 'x' becomes 'b'
- 'l' becomes 'p'
- 'i' becomes 'm'
- 't' becomes 'x'
- 'm' becomes 'q'
- 'g' becomes 'k'
- 'x' becomes 'b'
- 'y' becomes 'c'
- 'v' becomes 'z'
- 'i' becomes 'm'
- 'x' becomes 'b'
- 'l' becomes 'p'
- 'e' becomes 'i'
- 'x' becomes 'b'
- 'l' becomes 'p'
- 'e' becomes 'i'
- 'x' becomes 'b'
- 'm' becomes 'q'
- 'x' becomes 'b'
- 's' becomes 'w'
- 's' becomes 'w'
- 'o' becomes 's'
- 'm' becomes 'q'
- 'r' becomes 'v'
- 'x' becomes 'b'
- 'l' becomes 'p'
- 'i' becomes 'm'
- 'x' becomes 'b'
- 'v' becomes 'z'
- 'm' becomes 'q'
- 't' becomes 'x'

The output string is constructed by concatenating these shifted characters, resulting in the decoded message.
