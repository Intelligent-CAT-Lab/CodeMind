<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of n, which is approximately 2.82. Since the loop variable i is an integer, it will iterate for values 1 and 2.
For i = 1, n % i equals 0 (8 % 1 == 0), so it enters the if block. Inside the if block, it calculates m as n / i - 1, which is 8 / 1 - 1 = 7. Since i (1) is less than m (7), it adds m to ans, so ans becomes 0 + 7 = 7.
For i = 2, n % i equals 0 (8 % 2 == 0), so it enters the if block. Inside the if block, it calculates m as n / i - 1, which is 8 / 2 - 1 = 3. Since i (2) is less than m (3), it adds m to ans, so ans becomes 7 + 3 = 10.
The loop ends as there are no more integers between 2 and the square root of 8.
Finally, it prints the value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
