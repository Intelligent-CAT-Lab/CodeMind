The input "4 12" is read by the BufferedReader and split into two integers a and b, which are 4 and 12 respectively.

The main method calls the egcd method with these two integers. The egcd method is an implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b), where gcd is the greatest common divisor.

The initial values are set as follows:
x1 = 1, y1 = 0, r1 = a (which is 4)
x2 = 0, y2 = 1, r2 = b (which is 12)

The algorithm then enters a loop, which continues until r3 (the remainder of r1 divided by r2) becomes 0.

Here's the step-by-step execution of the loop:
1. q (quotient) = r1 / r2 = 4 / 12 = 0 (since we are dealing with integers)
2. r3 = r1 % r2 = 4 % 12 = 4
3. x3 = x1 - q * x2 = 1 - 0 * 0 = 1
4. y3 = y1 - q * y2 = 0 - 0 * 1 = 0

Since r3 is not 0, we continue with the next iteration after updating x1, y1, r1 with x2, y2, r2 and x2, y2, r2 with x3, y3, r3.

However, in the next iteration, r2 (which is now 4) cannot divide r1 (which is now 12) without a remainder, so the loop will terminate.

The final values before the loop breaks are:
x2 = 1
y2 = 0

These values are returned from the egcd method and printed by the main method.

Therefore, the output will be the values of x2 and y2, which are 1 and 0 respectively.
