<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user. The input string "1222" is read and stored in the variable `string`. The variable `count` is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates over each character in the string "1222". The loop runs from index 0 to the length of the string minus 1.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the character at the current index `i` is equal to '2'. If it is, the `count` variable is incremented.
The loop checks each character in the string "1222" and finds that the character '2' appears 3 times (at indices 1, 2, and 3).
After the loop finishes, the final value of `count` is 3, which is then printed to the console.
