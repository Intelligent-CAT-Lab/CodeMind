<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with the value 615 according to the input.
The if condition checks whether the remainder of x divided by 100 is less than or equal to the quotient of x divided by 100 multiplied by 5.
For the given input 615:
- x % 100 is 15 (the remainder of 615 divided by 100)
- x / 100 is 6 (the quotient of 615 divided by 100)
- x / 100 * 5 is 30 (6 multiplied by 5)

The if condition checks if 15 is less than or equal to 30, which is true.
Since the condition is true, the program prints 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
