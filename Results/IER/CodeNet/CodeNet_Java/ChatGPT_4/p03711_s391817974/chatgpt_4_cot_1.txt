<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `main` method that creates an instance of `Main` and a `Scanner` object to read input. The `solve` method is then called on the instance.

The `solve` method reads two integers `x` and `y` using the custom `Scanner` class. It then checks if `x` is equal to `y`. If they are equal, it prints "Yes" and returns, ending the method execution.

If `x` is not equal to `y`, the method creates two `HashSet` objects `set` and `set2`. `set` contains the integers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, which represent the months with 31 days. `set2` contains the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11, which represent the months with 30 days.

The method then checks if both `x` and `y` are in `set`. If they are, it prints "Yes" and returns. If not, it checks if both `x` and `y` are in `set2`. If they are, it prints "Yes" and returns.

If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "No".

Given the input `1 3`, the method will check if `x` is equal to `y`. Since `1` is not equal to `3`, it will then check if both `1` and `3` are in `set`. Since both `1` and `3` are in `set`, the method will print "Yes" and return.
