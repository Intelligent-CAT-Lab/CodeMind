<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable n. The input provided is `100`, so n will be set to 100. After that, the code prints out a string "ABC" concatenated with the value of n. Since n is 100, the output will be "ABC" followed by "100", resulting in "ABC100".
<<<Output>>>
ABC100
