<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads an integer value and assigns it to the variable 'age'. The input provided is `5`, so 'age' is set to 5.

Next, the code checks if the value of 'age' is either 3, 5, or 7 using an if-else statement. Since the value of 'age' is 5, which matches one of the conditions, the code enters the first branch of the if-else statement and prints "YES".

If the value of 'age' had been any other number than 3, 5, or 7, the code would have entered the else branch and printed "NO".

Since the input is `5`, the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
