<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to read three integers from the input, store them in an array, and then find the minimum sum of any two distinct integers from those three.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of how the code processes the input `1 3 4`:

1. The `FastScanner` class is used to read the input. It reads the input as a byte stream and converts it into integers.
2. The `nextIntArray` method is called to read three integers and store them in an array `n`.
3. The `TaskA` class has a `solve` method that takes this array and initializes a variable `min` with `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
4. It then uses two nested for-loops to iterate over the array indices (0, 1, 2) and calculate the sum of the pairs of integers at different indices (i.e., it does not add an integer with itself).
5. For each pair, it calculates the sum and updates `min` if the sum is less than the current `min`.
6. After all iterations, the smallest sum of any two distinct integers is found and printed.

For the input `1 3 4`, the possible sums are:
- `1 + 3 = 4`
- `1 + 4 = 5`
- `3 + 4 = 7`

The smallest sum is `4`, which is the sum of the integers `1` and `3`.
