<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `-13 3`. The `Solver` class is instantiated and its `solve` method is called. Inside the `solve` method, two integers `a` and `b` are read from the input using the `ni()` method, which internally uses the `FastScanner` class to parse the input. The values of `a` and `b` are set to `-13` and `3`, respectively.

The `solve` method then calls the `prtln` method with the result of the `max` method, which is overloaded to take three integers. The `max` method will return the maximum value among the three expressions: `a + b`, `a - b`, and `a * b`.

Let's calculate these expressions:
- `a + b` = `-13 + 3` = `-10`
- `a - b` = `-13 - 3` = `-16`
- `a * b` = `-13 * 3` = `-39`

The maximum value among `-10`, `-16`, and `-39` is `-10`. Therefore, the `solve` method will print `-10` as the output.

-10
