<<<Analysis>>>
The input `0 2 3 4 5` is read and split into an array of strings `["0", "2", "3", "4", "5"]`. Each string is then parsed into an integer and stored in the integer array `x`.

The array `x` now contains the integers `[0, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

The program enters a for loop that iterates over the array `x`. The loop runs from index 0 to the length of the array `x`.

During each iteration, the program checks if the current element `x[i]` is equal to 0. If it is, the program prints `i + 1` to the console.

In the given array `x`, the element at index 0 is 0. Therefore, when `i` is 0, `x[i]` is 0, and the condition `x[i] == 0` is true.

The program then prints `i + 1`, which is `0 + 1`, resulting in the output `1`.

After printing, the loop continues, but since there are no other elements with the value 0 in the array, no other numbers are printed.

The program does not print anything else and terminates after the loop finishes.
