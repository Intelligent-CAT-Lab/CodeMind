The variables n and m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. Since n equals m, the program enters the second if condition.

Inside the if condition, the program calls the solve method twice with arguments (n, m) which are both 2. The solve method calculates the factorial of the max argument (which is 2 in this case) and multiplies it by the x argument (also 2 in this case) for each iteration of the while loop, modulo 1000000007.

The solve method works as follows:
- It initializes answer to 1.
- It enters a while loop that continues until max is not equal to 1.
- Inside the loop, it multiplies answer by max (which is 2 initially), takes the modulo 1000000007, then multiplies by x (which is also 2 initially), and again takes the modulo 1000000007.
- It decrements both max and x by 1 and continues the loop.

Since max starts at 2, the loop will run only once. The calculation will be:
answer = 1 * 2 % 1000000007 * 2 % 1000000007 = 4

The solve method returns 4, and since it is called twice, the total answer before the modulo operation is 4 + 4 = 8.

Finally, the program takes the answer modulo 1000000007, which is still 8 because 8 is less than 1000000007.

The program then prints the answer, which is 8.
