<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two integers, T and X, from the input, which are 8 and 3 respectively according to the given input. After reading the input, the Scanner object is closed.

The code then calculates the division of T by X, which is the division of 8 by 3, resulting in a double value. The result of this division is stored in the variable ans.

The result is then formatted to a string with 10 decimal places using String.format("%.10f", ans). The formatted string is printed to the standard output.

The division of 8 by 3 results in approximately 2.6666666667 when formatted to 10 decimal places.

<<<Output>>>
2.6666666667
