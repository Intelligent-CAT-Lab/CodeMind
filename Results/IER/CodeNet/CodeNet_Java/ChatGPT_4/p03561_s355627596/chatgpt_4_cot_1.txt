<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3 2`, which means k=3 and n=2. The code first checks if k is even. Since k is 3 (which is odd), it skips the if block and moves to the else block.

In the else block, it initializes an ArrayList `list` and fills it with n (which is 2) elements, each being (k+1)/2. Since k is 3, (k+1)/2 is 2. So, the list initially contains [2, 2].

Next, it enters a for loop that runs n/2 times. Since n is 2, n/2 is 1, so the loop will run once. Inside the loop, it checks if the last element of the list is 1. If it is, it removes the last element; otherwise, it decreases the last element by 1 and then fills the list with k until its size is n.

Since the last element of the list is 2 (not 1), it decreases the last element by 1. Now the list is [2, 1]. Then it fills the list with k until the list size is n. Since the list size is already n (which is 2), it does not add any more elements.

Finally, it prints the elements of the list separated by spaces. The list contains [2, 1], so the output will be "2 1".
