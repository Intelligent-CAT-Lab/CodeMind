<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single line of input and splits it into two strings based on the space character. These strings are then converted into `BigInteger` objects `a` and `b`. The input provided is "5 8", so `a` is initialized with the value 5 and `b` with the value 8.

The `BigInteger` objects `a` and `b` are then multiplied together using the `multiply` method, resulting in a new `BigInteger` object `c`. The multiplication of 5 and 8 results in 40.

Finally, the code prints out the value of `c`, which is the result of the multiplication.

<<<Output>>>
40
