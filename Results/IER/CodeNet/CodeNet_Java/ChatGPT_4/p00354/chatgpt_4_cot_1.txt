<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer from the input using a Scanner object. The input provided is `1`. The string "thu:fri:sat:sun:mon:tue:wed" is then split into an array of strings using the split method with ":" as the delimiter. This results in an array containing ["thu", "fri", "sat", "sun", "mon", "tue", "wed"].

The input number `1` is then used in the expression `sc.nextInt()%7`, which calculates the remainder of the input number when divided by 7. Since the input is `1`, the remainder is also `1`.

The result of the expression is used as an index to access an element from the array. Since the remainder is `1`, the element at index `1` of the array is accessed, which is "fri".

Therefore, the output of the code will be "fri".
