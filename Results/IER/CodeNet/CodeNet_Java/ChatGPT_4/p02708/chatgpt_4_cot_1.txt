<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `FastScanner` class for fast input reading, a `Mas` class which is not used in the main method, and the `Main` class with the `main` method. The `main` method uses the `FastScanner` to read two integers `n` and `k`, which are 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.

The `MOD` constant is set to 1000000007, which is used for modulo operations to keep the numbers within integer range during calculations.

The main method calculates the variable `ans` by iterating from `k` to `n + 1`. For each `i` in this range, it calculates the first (`f`) and last (`l`) terms of an arithmetic sequence and then calculates the number of terms (`add`) by subtracting `f` from `l` and adding 1. The result is then added to `ans` modulo `MOD`.

For the given input `3 2`, the loop will run for `i = 2` and `i = 3` (since `i <= n + 1` which is `4`).

For `i = 2`:
- `f = i * (i - 1) / 2 = 2 * (2 - 1) / 2 = 1`
- `l = (n * 2 - i + 1) * i / 2 = (3 * 2 - 2 + 1) * 2 / 2 = 4 * 2 / 2 = 4`
- `add = l - f + 1 = 4 - 1 + 1 = 4`
- `ans = (ans + add) % MOD = (0 + 4) % 1000000007 = 4`

For `i = 3`:
- `f = i * (i - 1) / 2 = 3 * (3 - 1) / 2 = 3`
- `l = (n * 2 - i + 1) * i / 2 = (3 * 2 - 3 + 1) * 3 / 2 = 5 * 3 / 2 = 7`
- `add = l - f + 1 = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5`
- `ans = (ans + add) % MOD = (4 + 5) % 1000000007 = 9`

The final value of `ans` after the loop is `9`. This value is printed as the output.
