<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with the input value 29. The program then converts the integer x to a String s.
Since x is within the range of 10 to 99, the program checks if the string representation of x contains the character '9'.
In this case, since the input is 29, the string "29" does indeed contain '9'.
Therefore, the program will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
