<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `internationalization` is read and stored in the variable `s`. The length of the string is calculated and stored in the variable `leng`, which is 20 for this input.
The program then prints the first character of the string `s`, which is `i`.
Next, it prints the value of `leng-2`, which is `20-2=18`.
Finally, it prints the last character of the string `s`, which is `n`.
The output is the concatenation of these three parts: the first character, the length of the string minus two, and the last character.
