<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a `FastScanner` object which is used to read input from `System.in`. It also initializes a `PrintWriter` object for output. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

The code then enters a for loop that iterates 4 times, corresponding to the 4 integers in the input. In each iteration, it reads an integer using `sc.nextInt()` and adds it to `ans`.

Given the input `4 2 1 1`, the loop will execute as follows:
- In the first iteration, `input` is set to 4, and `ans` becomes 0 + 4 = 4.
- In the second iteration, `input` is set to 2, and `ans` becomes 4 + 2 = 6.
- In the third iteration, `input` is set to 1, and `ans` becomes 6 + 1 = 7.
- In the fourth iteration, `input` is set to 1, and `ans` becomes 7 + 1 = 8.

After the loop, the code prints the value of `ans` (which is 8) using `out.println(ans)` and then flushes the `PrintWriter` stream with `out.flush()` to ensure the output is sent to `System.out`.
