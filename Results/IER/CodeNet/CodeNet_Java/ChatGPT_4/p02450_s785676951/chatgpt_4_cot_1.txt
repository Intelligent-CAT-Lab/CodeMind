<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2` initializes the variable `n` with the value 2. An ArrayList `list` is created and populated with the numbers 1 and 2.

The `solve` method enters a while loop that will continue until the `list` is empty. Inside the loop, it prints the current permutation of the list, then calls `nextPermutation` to get the next permutation.

The `nextPermutation` method finds the rightmost element that is smaller than the element to its right (pivot). If no such element exists, it means we are at the last permutation, so the list is cleared and returned empty, which will break the while loop in `solve`.

If a pivot is found, the method then finds the smallest element greater than the pivot to the right of the pivot and swaps them. Then it sorts the sublist to the right of the pivot's original position to get the next permutation in lexicographic order.

For `n = 2`, the permutations in lexicographic order are:
1. [1, 2]
2. [2, 1]

After printing the second permutation, the `nextPermutation` method will not find a pivot, so it will clear the list and return it, causing the while loop to terminate.

The output will be the two permutations printed on separate lines.
