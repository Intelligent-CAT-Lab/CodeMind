The input is `2 1000000007`, which means N is initialized to 2 and M (the modulus) is initialized to 1000000007.

The `complex` method is called with N=2, which calculates the binomial coefficients modulo M. The resulting 2D array C will look like this:
```
C[0][0] = 1
C[1][0] = 1, C[1][1] = 1
C[2][0] = 1, C[2][1] = 2, C[2][2] = 1
```

The `stirling` method is called with N=2, which calculates the Stirling numbers of the second kind modulo M. The resulting 2D array S will look like this:
```
S[0][0] = 1
S[1][0] = 1, S[1][1] = 1
S[2][0] = 1, S[2][1] = 3, S[2][2] = 1
```

The `beki` method is a fast exponentiation method that calculates a^x modulo mod.

The `ways` method calculates the number of ways to partition a set of size N-i into non-empty subsets and then color each subset with one of two colors, considering the number of subsets.

The `ways2` method is a helper that calculates a part of the formula used in `ways`.

The main method then calculates the final answer by iterating from i=0 to N (which is 2 in this case), and for each i, it calculates the value of `ways(i)` and multiplies it by the binomial coefficient C[N][i], adjusting the sign based on whether i is even or odd. The final answer is the sum of these values modulo M.

Let's calculate the answer step by step:
- For i=0, `ways(0)` will be called, which will return 1 (since there's only one way to color an empty set). The binomial coefficient C[2][0] is 1. Since i is even, the sign is positive. So the contribution to the answer is 1.
- For i=1, `ways(1)` will be called, which will return 4 (since there are two ways to partition a set of size 1 into non-empty subsets, and each subset can be colored in two ways). The binomial coefficient C[2][1] is 2. Since i is odd, the sign is negative. So the contribution to the answer is -8, which is 1000000007 - 8 = 999999999 modulo M.
- For i=2, `ways(2)` will be called, which will return 16 (since there are four ways to partition a set of size 0 into non-empty subsets, and each subset can be colored in two ways). The binomial coefficient C[2][2] is 1. Since i is even, the sign is positive. So the contribution to the answer is 16.

The final answer is (1 + 999999999 + 16) % 1000000007 = 1000000016 % 1000000007 = 9.
