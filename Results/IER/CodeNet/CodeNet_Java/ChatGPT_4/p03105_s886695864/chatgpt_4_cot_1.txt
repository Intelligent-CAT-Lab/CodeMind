The variables a, b, and c are initialized with 2, 11, and 4 respectively according to the input. The variable count is initialized with 0.
The code enters a while loop that will continue as long as b is greater than or equal to a.
Inside the while loop, the following steps occur:
1. Increment count by 1.
2. Subtract the value of a from b.
3. Check if count is greater than or equal to c. If it is, break out of the loop.

The loop will run as follows:
- First iteration: count = 1, b = 11 - 2 = 9
- Second iteration: count = 2, b = 9 - 2 = 7
- Third iteration: count = 3, b = 7 - 2 = 5
- Fourth iteration: count = 4, b = 5 - 2 = 3

After the fourth iteration, count is equal to c (4), so the loop breaks.
The final value of count (4) is printed as the output.
