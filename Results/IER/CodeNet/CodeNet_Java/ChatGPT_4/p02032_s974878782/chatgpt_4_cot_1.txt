The input is `18`. The `solve()` method is called, which first calls `nl()` to read the input as a long integer, so `n` is set to 18.

Next, `sieveAtkin(2000000)` is called to generate an array of prime numbers up to 2,000,000. The sieve of Atkin is an optimized version to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. The returned array `primes` contains all the prime numbers up to 2,000,000.

Then, `enumDivisors(18, primes)` is called to find all divisors of 18. This method iterates through the prime numbers and for each prime, it checks if it divides `n` (18 in this case). It finds that 2 and 3 are divisors and calculates the divisors of 18, which are [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18]. The length of this array minus 1 is the number of proper divisors (excluding the number itself), so `d.length - 1` is 5.

After that, `factorX(18, primes)` is called to factorize the number 18. This method finds the prime factors of 18 and their exponents. It finds that 18 = 2^1 * 3^2, so the array `f` will contain [[2, 1], [3, 2]]. The length of this array is the number of distinct prime factors, so `f.length` is 2.

Finally, the method prints the number of distinct prime factors and the number of proper divisors, which are 2 and 5 respectively.
