<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `11`. The code is trying to find the smallest `k` such that the sum `1+2+...+k` is a multiple of `n`, which is `11` in this case. This is equivalent to finding the smallest `k` such that `k(k+1)/2 % n == 0`.

First, the code checks if `n` is `1`. If it is, it prints `1` and returns. Since `n` is `11`, it doesn't enter this condition.

Next, the code generates a list of divisors of `2n` (which is `22` in this case) using the `divisorList` function. The divisors of `22` are `1, 2, 11, 22`. These are stored in the list `list`.

The variable `ans` is initialized to `INF` (a very large number).

The code then iterates over each divisor `a` in the list and calculates `b` as `2n/a`. For each pair `(a, b)`, it uses the extended Euclidean algorithm (`extgcd` function) to find `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.

The code checks if `x` or `y` is `0` and continues to the next iteration if so. If `g` (the greatest common divisor) is `1` and `y` is negative, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `-b*y`.

After iterating through all divisors, the code prints the value of `ans`.

Let's go through the iterations:
- For `a = 1`, `b = 22`, `extgcd` returns `g = 1`, `x = 1`, `y = -1`. Since `y` is negative, `ans` is updated to `min(INF, -22*(-1)) = 22`.
- For `a = 2`, `b = 11`, `extgcd` returns `g = 1`, `x = 1`, `y = -1`. Since `y` is negative, `ans` is updated to `min(22, -11*(-1)) = 11`.
- For `a = 11`, `b = 2`, `extgcd` returns `g = 1`, `x = 1`, `y = -5`. Since `y` is negative, `ans` is updated to `min(11, -2*(-5)) = 10`.
- For `a = 22`, `b = 1`, `extgcd` returns `g = 1`, `x = 0`, `y = 1`. Since `x` is `0`, it continues to the next iteration, but there are no more divisors.

The smallest value of `ans` found is `10`, so the code prints `10`.
