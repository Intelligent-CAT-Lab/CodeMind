The variables x, y, and z are initialized with 3, 5, and 7 respectively according to the input. The variable sum is initialized with 0.
The code enters a for loop with the loop variable i starting at the value of x (3) and incrementing by x (3) each time through the loop until i is greater than z (7).
In each iteration of the loop, the value of y (5) is added to sum.
The loop runs as long as i is less than or equal to z. The values of i that the loop will iterate over are 3 and 6, since the next value, 9, would be greater than z (7) and the loop would terminate.
In the first iteration, sum becomes 0 + 5 = 5.
In the second iteration, sum becomes 5 + 5 = 10.
After the loop finishes, the final value of sum, which is 10, is printed as the output.
