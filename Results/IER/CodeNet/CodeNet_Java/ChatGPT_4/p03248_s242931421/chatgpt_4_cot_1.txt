<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "1111". The code first checks if the first character is '0' or the last character is '1'. Since the first character is '1' and the last character is also '1', it proceeds without printing -1.

Next, it initializes an ArrayList of Edge objects called li, an int variable root with a value of 1, and a boolean variable is1 with a value of true.

The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the string minus 2 (s.length - 1 - 1). In this case, the loop will iterate from 0 to 2 (since the length of "1111" is 4).

During each iteration, the code checks if the character at the current index i is different from the character at the mirrored index from the end (s.length - 2 - i). If they are different, it prints -1 and returns. Since all characters in "1111" are the same, this condition is never met.

If the current index i is not 0, the code adds a new Edge to the list li with the current root and i+1 as the start and end points. Since the string is "1111", the loop will add the following edges to the list:
- Edge(1, 2)
- Edge(2, 3)

The variable root is updated to i+1 if the current character is '1'. Since all characters are '1', root will be updated to 2 and then to 3.

After the loop, the code iterates over the list of edges and prints them. The edges in the list are:
- Edge(1, 2)
- Edge(2, 3)

Finally, the code checks if is1 is false. Since is1 is true (because all characters in the string are '1'), it prints the last edge as root + " " + s.length, which is "3 4".

The output will be the edges printed in the order they were added to the list, followed by the last edge.
