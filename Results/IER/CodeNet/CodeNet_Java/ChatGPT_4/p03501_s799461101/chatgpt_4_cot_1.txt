<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input: N, A, and B, which are initialized with 7, 17, and 120 respectively. It then calculates the product of N and A, which is 7 * 17 = 119. The code compares this product with B (120) using a ternary operator. Since 119 is less than 120, the condition N*A < B is true, and therefore the code will output the result of N*A, which is 119.
<<<Output>>>
119
