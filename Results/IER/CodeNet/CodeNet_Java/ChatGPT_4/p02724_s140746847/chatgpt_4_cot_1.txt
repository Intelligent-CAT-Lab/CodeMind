<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `1024`. The main method uses a `FastScanner` object to read the input as a long integer and assigns it to variable `a`.

The variable `uresii` is initialized to 0. The code then adds to `uresii` the result of `a/500*1000`. Since `1024/500` is 2 (integer division), it adds `2*1000` which is `2000` to `uresii`.

Next, the remainder of `a` after dividing by 500 is calculated using `a%=500`. So `1024%500` is `24`, and `a` is now `24`.

Then, the code adds to `uresii` the result of `a/5*5`. Since `24/5` is 4 (integer division), it adds `4*5` which is `20` to `uresii`.

Finally, `uresii` is printed, which now has the value `2000 + 20` which is `2020`.
