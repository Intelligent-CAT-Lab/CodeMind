<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the value 12 according to the input. The integer n is then converted to a String strn with the value "12". The length of strn is calculated and stored in the variable len, which is 2.

The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to len (2). Inside the loop, it takes each character of strn, converts it to an integer, and adds it to the variable sum. For the input "12", the digits are 1 and 2, so sum will be 1 + 2 = 3.

After the loop, the code checks if n (12) is divisible by sum (3). Since 12 is divisible by 3, the condition is true, and ans is set to "Yes".

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
