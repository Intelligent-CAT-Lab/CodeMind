<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple."
The code performs a series of replacements on the input string:
1. It replaces all occurrences of "apple" with "wwwp". The string becomes "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one wwwp."
2. It replaces all occurrences of "peach" with "wwwa". The string becomes "the cost of one wwwa is higher than that of one wwwp."
3. It replaces all occurrences of "wwwp" with "peach". The string becomes "the cost of one wwwa is higher than that of one peach."
4. It replaces all occurrences of "wwwa" with "apple". The string becomes "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach."

The purpose of using temporary placeholders "wwwp" and "wwwa" is to avoid direct replacement conflicts, ensuring that "apple" and "peach" are swapped correctly.

Finally, the code prints the resulting string.
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.
