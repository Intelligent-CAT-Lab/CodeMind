<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three integers A, B, and C with the values 3, 8, and 5 respectively according to the input. It then checks if C is between A and B (exclusive). The condition `(A < C && C < B)` checks if C is greater than A and less than B, and the condition `(B < C && C < A)` checks if C is greater than B and less than A. Since 3 < 5 and 5 < 8, the first condition `(A < C && C < B)` is true. Therefore, the code will print "Yes" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
