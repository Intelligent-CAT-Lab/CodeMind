<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers as input, which are 2 and 16, and assigns them to variables a and b, respectively. It then calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in the variable k, which is 18 in this case.

Next, the code checks if k is divisible by 2 (i.e., if k is even). Since 18 is even, the condition (k % 2 == 0) is true.

As the condition is true, the code proceeds to print the result of k divided by 2, which is 9.

Therefore, the output of the code will be 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
