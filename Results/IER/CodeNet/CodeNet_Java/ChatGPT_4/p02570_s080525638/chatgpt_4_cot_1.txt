<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three integer variables d, t, and s with the values 1000, 15, and 80 respectively according to the input. It then closes the Scanner object.
The if statement checks whether the product of s (speed) and t (time) is less than d (distance). In this case, the product of s (80) and t (15) is 1200, which is not less than d (1000).
Since the condition `(s * t) < d` is false, the else block is executed, and "Yes" is printed to indicate that the speed and time are sufficient to cover the distance.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
