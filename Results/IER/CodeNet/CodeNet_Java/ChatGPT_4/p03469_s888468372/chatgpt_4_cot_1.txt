<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input using a Scanner object. The input provided is "2017/01/07". The string 'a' is assigned this value.

The code then creates a new string 'b' by concatenating the string "2018" with a substring of 'a' starting from the 5th character (index 4, as Java uses 0-based indexing). The substring method call a.substring(4) will return "/01/07".

The resulting string 'b' will be "2018" concatenated with "/01/07", which is "2018/01/07".

Finally, the code prints out the string 'b'.
<<<Output>>>
2018/01/07
