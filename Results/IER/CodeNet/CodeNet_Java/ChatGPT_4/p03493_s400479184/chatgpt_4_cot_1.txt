<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The input provided is "101". The code then initializes an array of strings `sArray` with a size of 3. It then splits the string `s` into individual characters and assigns the first three characters to the `sArray` at indices 0, 1, and 2 respectively.

The code then initializes a variable `count` to 0. It checks each element of `sArray` to see if it is equal to "1". If it is, it increments `count` by 1.

For the input "101", `sArray` will be ["1", "0", "1"]. The code will then perform the following checks:
- `sArray[0].equals("1")` is true, so `count` becomes 1.
- `sArray[1].equals("1")` is false, so `count` remains 1.
- `sArray[2].equals("1")` is true, so `count` becomes 2.

Finally, the code prints the value of `count`, which is 2.
