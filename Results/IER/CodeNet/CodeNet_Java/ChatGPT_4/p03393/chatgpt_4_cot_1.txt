<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "atcoder". The program first creates a TreeSet of characters containing all the lowercase letters of the English alphabet. Then it iterates over each character in the input string and removes it from the set. After processing the input string, the set contains the characters that are not present in "atcoder".

The program then checks if the set is not empty. Since "atcoder" does not contain all the letters of the alphabet, the set is not empty. The program proceeds to append the first character from the set (which is the smallest character not present in "atcoder") to the input string and prints the result.

The TreeSet sorts the characters in natural order, so the first character not present in "atcoder" and still in the set would be 'b', as 'a' is already in "atcoder".

Therefore, the program appends 'b' to "atcoder" and prints "atcoderb".

<<<Output>>>
atcoderb
