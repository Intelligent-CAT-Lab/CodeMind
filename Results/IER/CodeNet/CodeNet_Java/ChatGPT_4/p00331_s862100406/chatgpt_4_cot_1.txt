<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read from standard input. It then reads two integers, H and R, from the input. According to the given input, H is assigned the value -3 and R is assigned the value 3.

The code then has a series of conditional checks:
1. It first checks if H*(-1) is equal to R. Since H is -3, H*(-1) would be 3, which is equal to R. Therefore, the condition is true.
2. Since the first condition is true, it prints "0" and does not proceed to the other conditions.

The other conditions would check if H*(-1) is greater than R or if H*(-1) is less than R, but these are not evaluated because the first condition is met.

<<<Output>>>
0
