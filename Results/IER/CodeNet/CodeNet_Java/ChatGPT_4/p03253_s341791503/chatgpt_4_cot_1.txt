<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `2 6`. The variable N is initialized with 2, and the variable M is initialized with 6.

The method `fra` is called with the value of M (6) and the list `unko`. This method is used to factorize the number 6 and add its prime factors to the list `unko`. The factorization of 6 is 2 and 3, so these values are added to the list `unko`.

Next, a 2D array `map` of size 65x2 is initialized with all elements set to 0.

A while loop is then used to process the elements of the list `unko`. Since the list contains the elements 2 and 3, the loop will run twice. For each element, it checks if the element is already in the `map` array. If it is, it increments the count of that element; otherwise, it adds the element to the `map` array and sets its count to 1. After processing, the `map` array will have the following structure:
```
map[0][0] = 2, map[0][1] = 1
map[1][0] = 3, map[1][1] = 1
```
The variable `counter` is set to 2 since there are two unique prime factors.

The variable `ans` is initialized with 1. A for loop is then used to calculate the product of combinations. The `Combi` method is called with parameters `map[i][1] + N - 1` and `N - 1`. For the given input, the calls will be `Combi(2, 1)` for both prime factors 2 and 3.

The `Combi` method calculates the combination `nCr`. For the given calls, it will return 2 for both calls since `2C1` is 2.

Finally, the variable `ans` is calculated as the product of these combinations modulo 1000000007. Since both combinations are 2, the final answer is `1 * 2 * 2 % 1000000007`, which equals 4.
