<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `3`, which means n is initialized to 3. The program then initializes a 4-dimensional array `dp` with dimensions [n][4][4][4], which is used for dynamic programming to store intermediate results.

Since n is not 1 or 2, the program skips the first two conditional blocks and proceeds to the nested loops to initialize the `dp` array for the case when m = 2 (third index of the array, which corresponds to the length of the sequence being considered).

The nested loops iterate over all possible combinations of the last three characters of a sequence (i, j, k) with 4 possibilities each (0 to 3). The conditions inside the loop check for specific sequences that are not allowed (based on the problem constraints), and if a sequence is allowed, it initializes `dp[2][i][j][k]` to 1.

After initializing the base cases, the program enters another set of nested loops to calculate the number of valid sequences of length m (from 3 to n-1). It does this by iterating over all possible last three characters of the sequence (i, j, k) and checking if adding another character t at the beginning of the sequence would result in a valid sequence. If it does, it adds the number of valid sequences of length m-1 that end with t, i, and j to `dp[m][i][j][k]`, modulo MOD.

Finally, the program sums up all the values in `dp[n - 1]` to get the total number of valid sequences of length n, again modulo MOD.

For n = 3, the program will calculate the number of valid sequences of length 3 by considering the base cases initialized for m = 2 and then using the dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of valid sequences for m = 3.

The final answer is the sum of all `dp[2][i][j][k]` values, which represent the number of valid sequences of length 3 that end with the characters i, j, and k.

Let's calculate the sum manually:
- There are 4^3 = 64 possible sequences of length 3.
- We need to subtract the invalid sequences from the total.
- The invalid sequences are those that contain "AGC", "GAC", "ACG" in this order anywhere in the sequence.
- Since we are only looking at sequences of length 3, we only need to consider these patterns at the start of the sequence.
- The invalid sequences are "AGC", "GAC", "ACG", which are 3 in total.
- So the valid sequences are 64 - 3 = 61.

Therefore, the output should be the number of valid sequences modulo MOD, which is 61 % (10^9 + 7) = 61.
