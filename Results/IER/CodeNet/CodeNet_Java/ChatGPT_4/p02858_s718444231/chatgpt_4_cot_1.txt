The input provided is `2 2 1`. The program reads these values and assigns them to variables `n`, `m`, and `T` respectively.

The `gcd` (Greatest Common Divisor) function is called to calculate the gcd of `T` and `n`, which is `gcd(1, 2)`. Since 1 is the gcd of any number with 1, `gn` is assigned the value 1.

Similarly, `gcd` is called to calculate the gcd of `T` and `m`, which is `gcd(1, 2)`. Again, `gm` is assigned the value 1.

The variable `mod` is set to `1000000007`, which is a large prime number often used as the modulus in problems involving modular arithmetic.

Next, the program calculates `q` as the gcd of `n/gn` and `m/gm`. Since `gn` and `gm` are both 1, `q` is the gcd of `n` and `m`, which is `gcd(2, 2)`. The gcd of any number with itself is the number itself, so `q` is 2.

The `pow` function is called to calculate `(2^q - 2)`, `(2^(n/gn))`, and `(2^(m/gm))` modulo `mod`. Since `q`, `n/gn`, and `m/gm` are all 2, these calculations are equivalent to `(2^2 - 2)`, `(2^2)`, and `(2^2)` modulo `mod`, which are `2`, `4`, and `4` respectively.

The expression inside the `out.println` call simplifies to `pow(2 - 2 + 4 + 4 - 1, 1, mod)`, which is `pow(7, 1, mod)`. Since the exponent is 1, the result is simply `7` modulo `mod`.

Finally, the program prints the result of the `pow` function call, which is `7`.
