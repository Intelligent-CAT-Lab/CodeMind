<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is initialized with "0011". The variable S0 is initialized with the character '0'. The variable S0mas is initialized with 0 to count the number of '0's in the string S.
The for loop iterates over each character in the string S. It checks if the current character str is equal to S0 ('0'). If it is, it increments S0mas by 1. In the given string "0011", there are two '0's, so S0mas becomes 2 after the loop.
The variable S1mas is calculated by subtracting S0mas from the length of S. Since the length of S is 4 and S0mas is 2, S1mas becomes 2.
The if condition checks if S0mas is less than S1mas. Since S0mas and S1mas are equal (both are 2), the else part of the condition is executed.
The output is the smaller of S0mas and S1mas multiplied by 2. Since they are equal, it doesn't matter which one is chosen. The result is 2 * 2, which is 4.
