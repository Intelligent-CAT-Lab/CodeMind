<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an integer variable `ans` with the value 700. It then reads a string `S` from the input, which in this case is "oxo". The code enters a for loop that iterates three times, corresponding to the three characters in the string `S`.

For each iteration, the loop checks if the character at the current index `i` is 'o'. If it is, the code adds 100 to the `ans` variable. The loop runs for indices 0, 1, and 2.

- On the first iteration (i=0), the character at index 0 is 'o', so 100 is added to `ans`, making it 800.
- On the second iteration (i=1), the character at index 1 is 'x', so nothing is added to `ans`.
- On the third iteration (i=2), the character at index 2 is 'o', so another 100 is added to `ans`, making it 900.

After the loop finishes, the final value of `ans` is printed, which is 900.
