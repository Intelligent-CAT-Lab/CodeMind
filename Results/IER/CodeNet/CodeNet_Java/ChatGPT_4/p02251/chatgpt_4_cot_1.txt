<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `100`, which represents the amount of money in cents for which the program will calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make that amount.

The program defines a method `solve()` which is called from the `main` method. The `solve()` method reads the input value `n` as `100`.

The program then calculates the number of 25-cent coins by dividing `n` by 25. Since 100 divided by 25 is 4, `ans` is incremented by 4, and `n` is updated to the remainder of 100 divided by 25, which is 0.

Next, the program calculates the number of 10-cent coins by dividing the updated `n` by 10. Since `n` is now 0, this step does not change `ans` or `n`.

The same process is repeated for 5-cent coins and 1-cent coins. Since `n` is already 0, these steps do not change `ans` or `n`.

Finally, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the total number of coins needed.

The output will be the total number of coins, which is 4 in this case, as all the money can be given using four 25-cent coins.
