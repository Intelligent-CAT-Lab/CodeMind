<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.

The code checks if K is even by using the modulus operator (K % 2 == 0). Since K is 2, it is even, and the condition is true.

Inside the if block, it calculates c1 as the integer division of N by K, which is 3 / 2, resulting in 1 (since it's integer division, the fractional part is discarded).

Next, it calculates c2 as the integer division of N by (K / 2), which is 3 / (2 / 2), resulting in 3 / 1, which is 3. Then it subtracts c1 from c2, resulting in 3 - 1, which is 2.

The final output is calculated as c1 * c1 * c1 + c2 * c2 * c2, which is 1 * 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 * 2, resulting in 1 + 8, which is 9.

The code then prints the result of this calculation.
