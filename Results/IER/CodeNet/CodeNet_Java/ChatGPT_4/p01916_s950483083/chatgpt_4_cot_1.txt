The input string is "hcpc". The code processes the input as follows:

1. The `solve` method is called with the input string "hcpc".
2. An array `alp` of size 26 is created to count the occurrences of each alphabet letter.
3. The input string is converted to a character array `a`.
4. A for loop iterates over the character array `a`, incrementing the count of each letter in the `alp` array. The counts after the loop will be:
   - 'h' (index 7): 1
   - 'c' (index 2): 2
   - 'p' (index 15): 1
5. Another for loop iterates over the `alp` array to count the number of odd occurrences of letters. The variable `oddNum` is incremented for each letter that has an odd count. In this case, 'h' and 'p' have odd counts, so `oddNum` becomes 2.
6. The result printed is the maximum of 0 and `oddNum/2`. Since `oddNum` is 2, `oddNum/2` is 1.
7. The output is therefore 1.
