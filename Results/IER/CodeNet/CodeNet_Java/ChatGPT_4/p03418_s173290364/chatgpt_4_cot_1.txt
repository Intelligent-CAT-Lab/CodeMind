The input provided is `5 2`, which means n is initialized to 5 and k is initialized to 2.

The `solve` method of `TaskD` class is called with these values. Inside this method, a variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

A for loop starts with `b` from `k + 1` (which is 3) to `n` (which is 5). The loop will iterate for `b` values 3, 4, and 5.

For each iteration of `b`:
- `q` is calculated as `n / b`, which is the quotient of dividing `n` by `b`.
- `r` is calculated as `n % b`, which is the remainder of dividing `n` by `b`.

The value of `ans` is updated in each iteration as follows:
- `ans` is incremented by `q * (b - k)`.
- `ans` is incremented by the maximum of 0 and `r - k + 1`.
- If `k` is 0, `ans` is decremented by 1. However, in this case, `k` is not 0, so this condition does not apply.

Let's calculate the values for each iteration:
1. For `b = 3`: `q = 5 / 3` which is 1, `r = 5 % 3` which is 2.
   - `ans += 1 * (3 - 2)` which is 1.
   - `ans += max(0, 2 - 2 + 1)` which is 1.
   - `ans` is now 2.

2. For `b = 4`: `q = 5 / 4` which is 1, `r = 5 % 4` which is 1.
   - `ans += 1 * (4 - 2)` which is 2.
   - `ans += max(0, 1 - 2 + 1)` which is 0.
   - `ans` is now 4.

3. For `b = 5`: `q = 5 / 5` which is 1, `r = 5 % 5` which is 0.
   - `ans += 1 * (5 - 2)` which is 3.
   - `ans += max(0, 0 - 2 + 1)` which is 0.
   - `ans` is now 7.

After the loop finishes, the final value of `ans` is 7, which is printed as the output.
