<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input. An array num of long integers with a size of 100 is created to store the sequence values.

The for loop iterates from 0 to 99. The first two elements of the array are initialized with specific values: num[0] is set to 2 and num[1] is set to 1. For the rest of the elements (from index 2 to 99), each element is calculated as the sum of the two preceding elements in the array. This creates a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starting with 2 and 1.

The sequence generated will be as follows:
num[0] = 2
num[1] = 1
num[2] = num[1] + num[0] = 1 + 2 = 3
num[3] = num[2] + num[1] = 3 + 1 = 4
num[4] = num[3] + num[2] = 4 + 3 = 7
num[5] = num[4] + num[3] = 7 + 4 = 11

After the loop finishes, the program prints the value of num[n], which is num[5] in this case.

<<<Output>>>
11
