<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3 2`. The `InputUtil` class reads this input and assigns the value 3 to `N` and the value 2 to `K`.

The `solve` method is then called. It calculates `baisuu` as `N/K`, which is `3/2` resulting in `1` (since it's integer division). Then `ans` is calculated as `baisuu*baisuu*baisuu`, which is `1*1*1` resulting in `1`.

Next, the code checks if `K` is even, which it is (`K=2`). It then checks if `N%K` is greater than or equal to `K/2`. Since `3%2` is `1` and `2/2` is `1`, the condition is true. Therefore, `baisuu` is incremented by 1, resulting in `2`.

The value of `ans` is then updated by adding `baisuu*baisuu*baisuu`, which is `2*2*2` resulting in `8`. So `ans` becomes `1 + 8`, which is `9`.

Finally, the `output` method is called, which prints the value of `ans` to the standard output.
