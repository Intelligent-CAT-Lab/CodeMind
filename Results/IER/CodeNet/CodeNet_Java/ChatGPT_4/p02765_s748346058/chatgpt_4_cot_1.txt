<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` that implements `Runnable` and contains a `main` method that starts a new thread with the `run` method of the `Main` class. The `run` method is where the actual logic of the program is executed.

The `run` method creates an `InputReader` object to read input from `System.in` and a `PrintWriter` object for output. It then reads two integers `n` and `r` from the input, which are 2 and 2919 respectively according to the given input.

The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 10. If it is, it simply prints the value of `r`. If `n` is less than 10, it calculates a new value by adding `r` to 100 times the difference between 10 and `n`.

In this case, since `n` is 2, which is less than 10, the program calculates the new value as follows:
`r + (100 * (10 - n))`
`2919 + (100 * (10 - 2))`
`2919 + (100 * 8)`
`2919 + 800`
`3719`

The program then prints this calculated value.

<<<Output>>>
3719
