<<<Analysis>>>
The variable c is initialized with the value 67 according to the input.
The if-else statement checks the range of the value of c.
Since 67 is within the range of 65 to 90, it represents an uppercase letter in ASCII (specifically, 'C').
Therefore, the variable code is set to 1.
The program then prints the value of the variable code, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
