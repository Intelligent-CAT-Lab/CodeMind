<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads three integers p, m, and c using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object. According to the input provided, the values of p, m, and c are set to 10, 10, and 20, respectively.

The code then calculates the sum of these three integers by adding them together using the + operator and prints the result to the standard output using System.out.println().

The sum of the integers 10, 10, and 20 is 40. Therefore, the output will be the integer 40.
