<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `10 20`, which means x is initialized to 10 and y is initialized to 20.

The code then enters a series of conditional checks to determine the output based on the values of x and y.

Since x is 10 and y is 20, and both are non-negative, the first if condition `if(x >= 0)` is true, and it enters this block.

Inside this block, it checks `if(y >= 0)`, which is also true, so it enters this block as well.

Now, it checks `if(x > y)`, which is false because x (10) is not greater than y (20). Therefore, it goes to the else block and executes `out.println(y-x);`.

The result of `y-x` is `20 - 10`, which equals 10.

The output is then printed, which is the result of the calculation above.
