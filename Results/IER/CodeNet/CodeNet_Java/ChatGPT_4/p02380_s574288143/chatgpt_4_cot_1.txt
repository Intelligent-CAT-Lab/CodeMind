The variables a, b, and c are initialized with 4, 3, and 90 respectively according to the input.

The first output line calculates the area of a triangle using the formula 0.5 * base * height * sin(angle). Since the angle c is given in degrees, it is converted to radians using Math.toRadians(c). The sine of 90 degrees is 1, so the area is 0.5 * 4 * 3 * 1 = 6.0.

The second output line calculates the perimeter of the triangle. It uses the formula perimeter = a + b + sqrt(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(angle)). Again, the angle is converted to radians. The cosine of 90 degrees is 0, so the third term under the square root becomes 0. The perimeter is therefore 4 + 3 + sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) = 7 + 5 = 12.0.

The third output line calculates the height of the triangle using the formula height = b * sin(angle), with the angle converted to radians. The sine of 90 degrees is 1, so the height is 3 * 1 = 3.0.
