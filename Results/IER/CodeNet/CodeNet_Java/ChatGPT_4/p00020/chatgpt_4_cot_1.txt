<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and stores it in the variable `s`. The input given is "this is a pen.".
It initializes an empty string `t` to store the transformed characters.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates over each character in the input string `s`.
For each character, it checks if the character is a lowercase letter (between 'a' (97) and 'z' (122)). If it is, it converts the character to uppercase by subtracting 32 from its ASCII value. If it's not a lowercase letter, it leaves the character unchanged.
The characters are concatenated to the string `t` in their transformed state.
The loop processes each character as follows:
- 't' (116) is converted to 'T' (84)
- 'h' (104) is converted to 'H' (72)
- 'i' (105) is converted to 'I' (73)
- 's' (115) is converted to 'S' (83)
- ' ' (space) is unchanged
- 'i' (105) is converted to 'I' (73)
- 's' (115) is converted to 'S' (83)
- ' ' (space) is unchanged
- 'a' (97) is converted to 'A' (65)
- ' ' (space) is unchanged
- 'p' (112) is converted to 'P' (80)
- 'e' (101) is converted to 'E' (69)
- 'n' (110) is converted to 'N' (78)
- '.' (period) is unchanged
After the loop finishes, the transformed string `t` is "THIS IS A PEN.".
The code then prints the transformed string `t`.
<<<Output>>>
THIS IS A PEN.
