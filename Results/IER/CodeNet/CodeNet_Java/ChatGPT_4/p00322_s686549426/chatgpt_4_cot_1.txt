<<<Analysis>>>
The input `7 6 -1 1 -1 9 2 3 4` initializes the `nums` array with the values [7, 6, -1, 1, -1, 9, 2, 3, 4]. The `-1` values represent the positions where we need to find a digit that is not already used in the `nums` array. The `used` array is initialized to keep track of which digits are already used, and it is updated to [false, false, true, true, true, false, true, true, false, true] based on the input.

The `solve` function is called with `idx` 0. Since `nums[0]` is not `-1`, it calls `solve` with `idx` 1. This continues until `idx` 2, where `nums[2]` is `-1`. Now, the program tries to find a digit between 1 and 9 that is not used. It finds that 5 and 8 are not used.

For `nums[2] = 5`, the `used` array is updated, and `solve` is called with `idx` 3. This continues until `idx` 4, where `nums[4]` is `-1`. The program tries to find a digit between 1 and 9 that is not used and finds that 8 is not used (since 5 is now used for `nums[2]`).

For `nums[4] = 8`, the `used` array is updated, and `solve` is called with `idx` 5. This continues until `idx` 9, which is the length of the `nums` array. Now the `check` function is called to verify the equation:

```
nums[0] + nums[1] * 10 + nums[2] + nums[3] * 100 + nums[4] * 10 + nums[5] == nums[6] * 100 + nums[7] * 10 + nums[8]
```

Substituting the values, we get:

```
7 + 6 * 10 + 5 + 1 * 100 + 8 * 10 + 9 == 2 * 100 + 3 * 10 + 4
```

Which simplifies to:

```
7 + 60 + 5 + 100 + 80 + 9 == 200 + 30 + 4
```

And further to:

```
261 == 234
```

This is not true, so the `check` function returns `false`, and the `solve` function backtracks to try the next unused digit for `nums[4]`. Since there are no more unused digits, it backtracks further to try the next unused digit for `nums[2]`, which is 8.

For `nums[2] = 8`, the `used` array is updated, and `solve` is called with `idx` 3. This continues until `idx` 4, where `nums[4]` is `-1`. The program tries to find a digit between 1 and 9 that is not used and finds that 5 is not used (since 8 is now used for `nums[2]`).

For `nums[4] = 5`, the `used` array is updated, and `solve` is called with `idx` 5. This continues until `idx` 9, which is the length of the `nums` array. Now the `check` function is called to verify the equation:

```
7 + 6 * 10 + 8 + 1 * 100 + 5 * 10 + 9 == 2 * 100 + 3 * 10 + 4
```

Which simplifies to:

```
7 + 60 + 8 + 100 + 50 + 9 == 200 + 30 + 4
```

And further to:

```
234 == 234
```

This is true, so the `check` function returns `true`, and the `solve` function returns 1. Since there are no more digits to try for `nums[2]` and `nums[4]`, the `solve` function does not backtrack further and the final result is 1.
