<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 11 according to the input. The variable limit7 is calculated as N / 7, which is 11 / 7, resulting in 1 because it's an integer division.
The variable check is initialized as false.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 (inclusive) to check if there is a combination of multiples of 7 and 4 that sums up to N.
In the first iteration (i = 0), the variable left is calculated as N - (i * 7), which is 11 - (0 * 7) = 11. Then it checks if left % 4 == 0, which is not true for 11 % 4.
In the second iteration (i = 1), the variable left is calculated as 11 - (1 * 7) = 4. Then it checks if left % 4 == 0, which is true for 4 % 4.
Since the condition is met, check is set to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of check. Since check is true, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
