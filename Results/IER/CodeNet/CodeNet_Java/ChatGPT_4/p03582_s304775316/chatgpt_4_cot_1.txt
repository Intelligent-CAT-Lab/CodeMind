<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 2 0` initializes the variables x, y, and z with the values 2, 2, and 0 respectively. The variable n is the sum of x, y, and z, which is 4 in this case.

The program then enters a for loop that will iterate 4 times (since n is 4). The variable `ans` is initially an empty string.

In each iteration, the program checks if it can add a 'c', 'b', or 'a' to the `ans` string without violating the conditions checked by the `isOK` method. Since z is 0 from the start, the condition to add 'c' is never met.

The `isOK` method checks if the prefix created by adding a new character to `ans` is valid. It does this by checking if the prefix is not a substring of itself and if it is lexicographically greater than any of its suffixes.

In the first iteration, since z is 0, the program checks if it can add 'b'. The `isOK` method will return true because the prefix "b" does not violate any conditions. Thus, y is decremented to 1, and 'b' is added to `ans`.

In the second iteration, the program again checks if it can add 'b'. The `isOK` method will return true for the prefix "bb", and y is decremented to 0, and 'b' is added to `ans`.

Now, y is 0, so the program will only be able to add 'a' in the remaining iterations. The `isOK` method will return true for the prefixes "bba" and "bbaa", and x is decremented accordingly.

The final value of `ans` after the loop is "bbaa".

The program then prints the value of `ans` and flushes the output.

<<<Output>>>
bbaa
