<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `20`, which is read by the `FastScanner` class's `ni()` method and assigned to the variable `N` in the `solve` method.

The `solve` method calculates two values, `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is calculated as `N * 800`, which is `20 * 800 = 16000`. The value of `y` is calculated as `(N / 15) * 200`, which is `(20 / 15) * 200`. Since `20 / 15` is an integer division, it results in `1`, so `y` is `1 * 200 = 200`.

The final output is the result of `x - y`, which is `16000 - 200 = 15800`.

The `out.println(x - y)` statement prints this result to the standard output, and then `out.flush()` ensures that the output is actually sent to the standard output.
