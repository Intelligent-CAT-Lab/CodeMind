<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 2 2` initializes the variables N, M, and K with the values 2, 2, and 2 respectively.

The `Mod` class is instantiated with the value `N*M` which is `2*2 = 4`. This initializes the `fact` array with a size of 5 (0 to 4).

The `comb` method of the `Mod` class is called with parameters `M*N-2` and `K-2`, which are `2*2-2 = 2` and `2-2 = 0` respectively. The `comb` method calculates the combination of 2 items taken 0 at a time, which is 1.

The `ans` variable is calculated using the `add` method with two calls to the `div` method. The `div` method calls the `mul` method with several parameters and then multiplies the result by the modular inverse of the last parameter.

The first `div` call in `ans` calculation:
- `mul(N, N-1, N+1, C, M, M)` calculates `2 * 1 * 3 * 1 * 2 * 2 = 24`.
- `div(24, 6)` calculates `24 * Mod.inverse(6) % MOD`. The `inverse` method calculates `power(6, MOD - 2)`, which is `6^(10^9+7-2) % MOD`. The result of this power operation modulo `MOD` is the modular inverse of 6. Let's call this result `inv6`.
- The result of `div(24, 6)` is `24 * inv6 % MOD`.

The second `div` call in `ans` calculation:
- `mul(M, M-1, M+1, C, N, N)` calculates `2 * 1 * 3 * 1 * 2 * 2 = 24`.
- `div(24, 6)` calculates `24 * inv6 % MOD`, which is the same as the first `div` call.

The `add` method then adds the results of the two `div` calls modulo `MOD`. Since both `div` calls result in the same value, the final `ans` is `2 * (24 * inv6 % MOD) % MOD`.

Finally, the `ans` is printed out.

Since the modular inverse and power operations are not trivial to calculate manually without actual code execution, we cannot provide the exact numerical output. However, the structure of the calculation is as described above.

<<<Output>>>
The exact numerical output cannot be determined without executing the code due to the complexity of the modular inverse and power operations.
