<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "AIZUNYANPEROPERO" is read and stored in the variable line. A StringBuilder object sb is created to build the output string, and a boolean variable a is initialized to true.

The program then iterates over each character in the input string:
1. When the first 'A' is encountered, the boolean variable a is set to false.
2. The next characters 'I', 'Z', 'U', 'N', 'Y', 'A', 'N', 'P', 'E', 'R', 'O', 'P', 'E', 'R', 'O' are checked, but none of them change the state since we are looking for a sequence of 'A' followed by 'Z'.
3. When the 'Z' is encountered, since a is false (indicating that an 'A' has been found before without a subsequent 'Z'), "AZ" is appended to sb, and a is set back to true.

Since there is only one occurrence of 'A' followed by 'Z', the StringBuilder sb contains "AZ".

Finally, the program checks if sb has a length greater than 0, which it does, so it prints the contents of sb.

<<<Output>>>
AZ
