<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. The variable ans is declared but not initialized.

The code checks if k is even by using the condition (k % 2 == 0). Since k is 2, which is even, the condition is true.

Inside the if block, ans is calculated as follows:
- First, it calculates (n / k) * (n / k) * (n / k), which is (3 / 2) * (3 / 2) * (3 / 2). Since n and k are both long types, the division is integer division, so (3 / 2) is 1. Therefore, ans = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.
- Then, it increments n by k / 2, which is 2 / 2 = 1, so now n becomes 3 + 1 = 4.
- Next, it calculates (n / k) * (n / k) * (n / k) again with the new value of n, which is (4 / 2) * (4 / 2) * (4 / 2) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.
- Finally, it adds this value to ans, so ans becomes 1 + 8 = 9.

The code then prints the value of ans.
