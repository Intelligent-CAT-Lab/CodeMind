<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three variables a, t, and r with the values 180, 120, and 90 respectively according to the input. The variable t is declared as a double, which means it can hold decimal values.

The code then calculates the expression `t / a * r`. Since t is a double, the division `t / a` will result in a double value, ensuring that the precision is not lost during the division operation. The result of `t / a` is `120 / 180` which equals `0.6666666666666666`. This result is then multiplied by `r` which is `90`.

The final calculation is `0.6666666666666666 * 90`, which equals `60.0`. The result is printed to the console.

<<<Output>>>
60.0
