<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read from the standard input. It then reads three integers a, b, and c with the values 1, 3, and 2 respectively according to the input provided.

The if statement checks whether the value of c is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b. In this case, since 1 <= 2 and 2 <= 3, the condition is true.

Because the condition is true, the program prints "Yes" to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
