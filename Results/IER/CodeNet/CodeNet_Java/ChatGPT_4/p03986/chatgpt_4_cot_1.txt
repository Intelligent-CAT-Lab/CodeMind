<<<Analysis>>>
The input string x is initialized with "TSTTSS". The variables c and len are initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates over each character of the string "TSTTSS".

1. i=0, x.charAt(i) is 'T', so c becomes -1.
2. i=1, x.charAt(i) is 'S', c is less than 0, so len becomes len - c (0 - (-1) = 1), and c is set to 1.
3. i=2, x.charAt(i) is 'T', so c becomes 0.
4. i=3, x.charAt(i) is 'T', so c becomes -1.
5. i=4, x.charAt(i) is 'S', c is less than 0, so len becomes len - c (1 - (-1) = 2), and c is set to 1.
6. i=5, x.charAt(i) is 'S', c is not less than 0, so c becomes 2.

After the loop, len is added to the absolute value of c, which is 2 + abs(2) = 4.

The final value of len is printed, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
