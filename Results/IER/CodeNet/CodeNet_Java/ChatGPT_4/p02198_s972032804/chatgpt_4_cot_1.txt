<<<Analysis>>>
The code creates a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then waits for the user to input two integers. According to the given input, the two integers are 3 and 4. The Scanner object reads the first integer (3) and then the second integer (4) as the user inputs them. The program then multiplies these two integers together using the multiplication operator (*). The result of the multiplication, which is 3 * 4, is 12. Finally, the program prints out the result of the multiplication to the standard output using System.out.println.
<<<Output>>>
12
