<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads a string `s` from the input, which is "29" in this case. The `solve` method checks if the first character (`charAt(0)`) or the second character (`charAt(1)`) of the string `s` is '9'. Since the input string is "29", the first character is '2' and the second character is '9'. The condition `s.charAt(1) == '9'` is true because the second character is indeed '9'. Therefore, the ternary operator will evaluate to "Yes". The result "Yes" is then printed to the standard output.
