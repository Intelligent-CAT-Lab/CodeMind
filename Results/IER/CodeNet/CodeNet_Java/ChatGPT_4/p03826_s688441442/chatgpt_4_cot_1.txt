<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four integers from the input using a Scanner object. These integers are multiplied in pairs: the first two integers are multiplied to get 'a', and the next two integers are multiplied to get 'b'. Specifically, 'a' is the product of 3 and 5, which equals 15, and 'b' is the product of 2 and 7, which equals 14. The code then compares 'a' and 'b' using an if-else statement. Since 'a' (15) is greater than 'b' (14), the code will print the value of 'a'.
<<<Output>>>
15
