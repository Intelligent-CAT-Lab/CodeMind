<<<Analysis>>>
The input is read and split into an array of strings, which are then parsed into integers and assigned to variables W, H, x, y, and r with the values 5, 4, 2, 2, and 1 respectively.

The code then checks if a circle with radius r can be drawn within a rectangle of width W and height H such that the circle's center is at (x, y). The conditions checked are:
- The left edge of the circle (x - r) must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The right edge of the circle (x + r) must be less than or equal to W.
- The top edge of the circle (y - r) must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The bottom edge of the circle (y + r) must be less than or equal to H.

For the given input, the conditions are evaluated as follows:
- (x - r) = (2 - 1) = 1, which is >= 0.
- (x + r) = (2 + 1) = 3, which is <= W (5).
- (y - r) = (2 - 1) = 1, which is >= 0.
- (y + r) = (2 + 1) = 3, which is <= H (4).

Since all conditions are met, the variable judge is set to "Yes".

Finally, the code outputs the value of judge, which is "Yes".
