<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single line of input and parses it as an integer, which is stored in the variable F. The input given is `68`, so F is initialized with the value 68.
The code then calculates the result of the expression `(F - 30) / 2`. Substituting the value of F, the expression becomes `(68 - 30) / 2`.
This simplifies to `38 / 2`, which equals 19.
The result of the calculation, 19, is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
19
