<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is `OJJOOIIOJOI`. The code processes this string to find the longest sequence of the pattern "JOI" where the number of 'O's is less than or equal to the number of 'J's and 'I's on either side.

The code first creates an empty list `list` to store arrays of strings. It then iterates over each character of the input string. For each character, it initializes a temporary array `tmp` of size 2. It checks if the character is 'I', 'O', or 'J' and assigns the character to `tmp[0]`. It then counts consecutive occurrences of the same character and assigns this count to `tmp[1]`. This count is done in the inner while loop. The `tmp` array is then added to the `list`.

After processing the input string, the `list` will contain the following elements:
- ["O", "1"]
- ["J", "2"]
- ["O", "2"]
- ["I", "2"]
- ["O", "1"]
- ["J", "1"]
- ["O", "1"]
- ["I", "1"]

Next, the code iterates over the `list` to find the maximum length of 'O's that are sandwiched between 'J's and 'I's with the condition that the number of 'J's before and the number of 'I's after should be greater than or equal to the number of 'O's. It does this by checking the elements at positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` for each `i` from 1 to `list.size() - 2`.

The first valid "JOI" pattern is found with:
- `tmpJ` = ["J", "2"]
- `tmpO` = ["O", "2"]
- `tmpI` = ["I", "2"]

Since the number of 'J's and 'I's is equal to the number of 'O's, this pattern is valid, and `answer` is updated to 2.

The next valid "JOI" pattern is found with:
- `tmpJ` = ["O", "2"]
- `tmpO` = ["I", "2"]
- `tmpI` = ["O", "1"]

However, this is not a valid pattern because `tmpJ` is not "J" and `tmpO` is not "O".

The last valid "JOI" pattern is found with:
- `tmpJ` = ["O", "1"]
- `tmpO` = ["J", "1"]
- `tmpI` = ["O", "1"]

Again, this is not a valid pattern because `tmpJ` is not "J" and `tmpO` is not "O".

Since no other valid patterns are found and the maximum length of 'O's in a valid "JOI" pattern is 2, the final answer is 2.
