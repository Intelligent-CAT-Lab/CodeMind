<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in).
It initializes an integer variable c with 0.
It reads an integer from the input and assigns it to variable a, which will be 1 according to the given input.
It reads a string from the input and assigns it to variable s, which will be "+" according to the given input.
It reads another integer from the input and assigns it to variable b, which will be 2 according to the given input.
The code then checks the value of the string s. If s equals "+", it sets c to the result of a + b. If s equals "-", it sets c to the result of a - b.
Since s is "+", it performs the addition of a and b, which is 1 + 2, and assigns the result, which is 3, to c.
Finally, it prints the value of c, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
