<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "6 3 2 1" is read and passed to the convStrToInt method. This method splits the string into an array of strings ["6", "3", "2", "1"] and then converts each string into an integer, resulting in an integer array [6, 3, 2, 1].

The integer array is then passed to the TwoNorThree method. This method calculates the result by subtracting the second and third elements from the first element and then adding the fourth element. The calculation is as follows:

result = i[0] - i[1] - i[2] + i[3]
result = 6 - 3 - 2 + 1
result = 6 - 5
result = 1

The final result, which is 1, is then printed to the console.
