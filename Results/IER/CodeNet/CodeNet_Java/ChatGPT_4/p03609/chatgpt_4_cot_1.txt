<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two integers, x and t, from the input. According to the given input, x is assigned the value 100 and t is assigned the value 17.

The code then checks if x is greater than t using an if-else statement. Since x (100) is greater than t (17), the condition of the if statement is true. Therefore, the code executes the statement within the if block, which is to print the result of x minus t (100 - 17).

The code does not execute the else if block because the condition for the if block is already met.

Finally, the code prints the result of the subtraction, which is 83.
<<<Output>>>
83
