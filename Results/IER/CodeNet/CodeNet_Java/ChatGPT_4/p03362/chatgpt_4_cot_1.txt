<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input. The program then enters a for loop that starts with i = 6 and increments by 5 each time, checking numbers that end with a 1 (since i is always 1 more than a multiple of 5).

The loop continues until it finds N prime numbers that satisfy the condition. The isPrime function checks if a number is prime by attempting to divide it by all numbers from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any division has no remainder, the number is not prime.

The first five numbers that are prime and end with a 1 (since they are one more than a multiple of 5) are 11, 31, 41, 61, and 71. These numbers will be printed with a space between them.

The count variable keeps track of how many prime numbers have been found and printed. Once count reaches N, which is 5 in this case, the loop breaks and the program ends.

<<<Output>>>
11 31 41 61 71
