<<<Analysis>>>
The input "1 1 3 4" is read and tokenized into four integers which are stored in the array `sides`. The array `sides` is then filled with these integers: [1, 1, 3, 4]. The variable `total` is not used further in the code, so its calculation does not affect the outcome.

The array `sides` is then sorted, resulting in the array [1, 1, 3, 4]. The code checks if the first two elements are equal and if the last two elements are equal. In this case, `sides[0] == sides[1]` is true because both are 1, but `sides[2] == sides[3]` is false because 3 is not equal to 4.

Since the condition for printing "yes" is not met (both pairs of sides are not equal), the code will print "no".

<<<Output>>>
no
