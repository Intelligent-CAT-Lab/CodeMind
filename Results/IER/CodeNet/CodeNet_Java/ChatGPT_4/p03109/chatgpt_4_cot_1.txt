<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a date string in the format `YYYY/MM/DD` from the input. It then uses the `substring` method to extract the part of the string starting from the 6th character (index 5, since indices are 0-based), which corresponds to the month and day part `MM/DD`.

Given the input `2019/04/30`, the `substring` method will extract `04/30`.

The code then checks the first character of the extracted string to see if it is '1', which would indicate a month of 10, 11, or 12. Since the first character is '0', this condition is false.

Next, the code checks if the numeric value of the second character of the extracted string is greater than 4, which would indicate a month greater than April. Since the second character is '4', the numeric value is not greater than 4, and this condition is also false.

Since neither condition is met, the code prints "Heisei".
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
