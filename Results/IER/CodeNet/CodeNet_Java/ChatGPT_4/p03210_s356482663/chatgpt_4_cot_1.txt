<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a new Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable 'age'. The input provided is `5`.

The code then checks if the value of 'age' is either 3, 5, or 7 using an if-else statement. Since the input value is 5, the condition (age == 3 || age == 5 || age ==7) evaluates to true.

Because the condition is true, the code executes the first branch of the if-else statement and prints "YES" to the standard output.

After printing, the code does not have any more statements to execute, so it will terminate after this point.

<<<Output>>>
YES
