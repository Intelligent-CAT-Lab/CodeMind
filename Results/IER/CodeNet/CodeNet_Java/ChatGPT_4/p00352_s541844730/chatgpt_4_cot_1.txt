<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using a Scanner object. The two integers are 1000 and 3000. It then adds these two integers together, resulting in 4000. The sum is then divided by 2, which results in 2000. The result of this division is printed to the console. Therefore, the output will be 2000.
<<<Output>>>
