<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate the factorial of two numbers n and m, and then depending on their relationship, it calculates a final answer and prints it.

The input provided is "2 2", so both n and m are initialized to 2.

The code then enters two separate for loops to calculate the factorial of n (nk) and m (mk) respectively. Since n and m are both 2, the loops will perform the same operations.

For n (and similarly for m):
- When i is 1, nk = nk * 1 = 1 * 1 = 1.
- When i is 2, nk = nk * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2.
- After each multiplication, nk is taken modulo 1000000007, but since nk is less than 1000000007, it remains unchanged.

After the loops, nk and mk both equal 2.

The code then checks the relationship between n and m:
- Since n equals m, the code enters the first if condition.
- It calculates the answer as (2 * (nk * mk)) % 1000000007.
- Substituting the values, ans = (2 * (2 * 2)) % 1000000007 = (2 * 4) % 1000000007 = 8 % 1000000007 = 8.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 8.
