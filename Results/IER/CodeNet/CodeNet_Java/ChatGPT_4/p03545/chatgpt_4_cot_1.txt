<<<Analysis>>>
The input "1222" is read and stored in the variable str. The program then creates an array ch of size 4 to store each character of the input string as a separate string.

The for loop iterates 4 times, from 0 to 3, and each time it takes a substring of str from index i to i+1 and stores it in the corresponding index of the ch array. After the loop, ch will contain ["1", "2", "2", "2"].

Next, the program converts each string in the ch array to an integer and stores them in variables a, b, c, and d. So, a=1, b=2, c=2, and d=2.

The program then checks various combinations of addition and subtraction of these numbers to see if they equal 7. It uses an array ans to store the operators that make the expression equal to 7.

The correct combination for the input "1222" is found in the second condition (a + b + c - d == 7), which is true because 1 + 2 + 2 - 2 equals 7. Therefore, ans[0] is set to "+", ans[1] is set to "+", and ans[2] is set to "-".

Finally, the program prints the expression with the operators that make it equal to 7, which in this case is "1+2+2-2=7".

<<<Output>>>
1+2+2-2=7
