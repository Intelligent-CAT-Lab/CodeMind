<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to determine if there exists a pair of integers (i, j) such that the following equation is satisfied:
`sum = M * i + N * j - (i * j * 2) == K`
where N, M, and K are integers provided as input.

Given the input `2 2 2`, the variables N, M, and K are initialized with the values 2, 2, and 2 respectively.

The code then enters a nested for loop structure, where i ranges from 0 to N (inclusive) and j ranges from 0 to M (inclusive). For each pair (i, j), it calculates the value of `sum` using the formula provided.

The nested loops will iterate through the following pairs of (i, j):
(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)

For each pair, the value of `sum` is calculated as follows:
- For (0, 0): sum = 2 * 0 + 2 * 0 - (0 * 0 * 2) = 0
- For (0, 1): sum = 2 * 0 + 2 * 1 - (0 * 1 * 2) = 2
- For (0, 2): sum = 2 * 0 + 2 * 2 - (0 * 2 * 2) = 4
- For (1, 0): sum = 2 * 1 + 2 * 0 - (1 * 0 * 2) = 2
- For (1, 1): sum = 2 * 1 + 2 * 1 - (1 * 1 * 2) = 2
- For (1, 2): sum = 2 * 1 + 2 * 2 - (1 * 2 * 2) = 2
- For (2, 0): sum = 2 * 2 + 2 * 0 - (2 * 0 * 2) = 4
- For (2, 1): sum = 2 * 2 + 2 * 1 - (2 * 1 * 2) = 2
- For (2, 2): sum = 2 * 2 + 2 * 2 - (2 * 2 * 2) = 0

We can see that the value of `sum` is equal to K (which is 2) for several pairs: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 1). Therefore, the condition `if (sum == K)` is satisfied multiple times.

As soon as the condition is satisfied for the first time, the program prints "Yes" and returns, terminating the execution. Since the condition is satisfied for the pair (0, 1), the program will output "Yes" and stop.
