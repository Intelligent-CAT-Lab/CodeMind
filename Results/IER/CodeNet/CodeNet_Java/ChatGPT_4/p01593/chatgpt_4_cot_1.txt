<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate some form of probability distribution using dynamic programming. The variables n and m are initialized with 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.

The `solve` method initializes a double array `dp` of size n+1 (which is 3 in this case) and sets the first element `dp[0]` to 1. This array will be used to store intermediate results.

The nested for loops are used to update the `dp` array. The outer loop runs from 1 to n (inclusive), and the inner loop runs from 1 to the minimum of m and the current index of the outer loop (inclusive). In this case, since m is 1, the inner loop will always run from 1 to 1.

For each iteration of the outer loop:
- When j=1, the inner loop will iterate once with i=1. It will add `dp[0]/1` to `dp[1]`. Since `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` becomes 1.
- When j=2, the inner loop will iterate once with i=1. It will add `dp[1]/2` to `dp[2]`. Since `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` becomes 0.5.

After the loops, the `println` method is called with the formatted string of `dp[n]`, which is `dp[2]` in this case. The output will be formatted to 12 decimal places.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `dp[2]` formatted to 12 decimal places, which is `0.500000000000`.
