<<<Analysis>>>
The main method starts a new thread with the TaskAdapter runnable and waits for it to finish with `join()`. The TaskAdapter's `run` method creates a `FastInput` object to read from `System.in` and a `FastOutput` object to write to `System.out`.

The `TaskA` class has a `solve` method that reads a string using `FastInput` and checks for the presence and positions of 'C' and 'F' in the string. It uses `indexOf` to find the first occurrence of 'C' and `lastIndexOf` to find the last occurrence of 'F'.

The input string is `CODEFESTIVAL`. The `indexOf` method will return the index of the first 'C', which is 0, and `lastIndexOf` will return the index of the last 'F', which is 5. Since the index of 'C' (0) is less than the index of 'F' (5), and both characters are present, the condition `cIndex < 0 || fIndex < 0 || fIndex < cIndex` is false.

Therefore, the `solve` method will output "Yes" to indicate that there is a 'C' before an 'F' in the string.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
