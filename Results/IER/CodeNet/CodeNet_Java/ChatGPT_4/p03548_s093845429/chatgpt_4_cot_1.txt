The variables x, y, and z are initialized with 13, 3, and 1 respectively according to the input. The variable answer is initialized with 0.

The code enters an infinite while loop and checks the following conditions:
1. If answer is 0 (which it is initially), it checks if y + 2*z is greater than x (3 + 2*1 > 13), which is false. So, it increments answer to 1 and subtracts y + 2*z from x (x becomes 13 - (3 + 2*1) = 13 - 5 = 8).
2. The loop continues, and now answer is not 0, so it checks if y + z is greater than x (3 + 1 > 8), which is false. So, it increments answer to 2 and subtracts y + z from x (x becomes 8 - (3 + 1) = 8 - 4 = 4).
3. The loop continues, and again answer is not 0, so it checks if y + z is greater than x (3 + 1 > 4), which is false. So, it increments answer to 3 and subtracts y + z from x (x becomes 4 - (3 + 1) = 4 - 4 = 0).
4. The loop continues, and now y + z is not greater than x because x is 0, so it would break the loop.

The loop breaks and the final value of answer (which is 3) is printed as the output.
