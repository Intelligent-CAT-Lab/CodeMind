<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "010" is read and stored in variable s. Then, the character '2' is appended to s, resulting in the string "0102".
The length of the string s is now 4, so variable n is set to 4, and variable ans is initialized to 3 (n - 1).

The for loop iterates from i = 0 to i = 2 (since it runs until n - 1, which is 3, but the condition is i < n - 1).

In the first iteration (i = 0), s.charAt(i) is '0' and s.charAt(i + 1) is '1'. Since they are not equal, the if condition is satisfied. The value of tmp is calculated as the maximum of i + 1 (which is 1) and n - i - 2 (which is 3). So, tmp is 3. The value of ans is updated to the minimum of ans and tmp, which remains 3.

In the second iteration (i = 1), s.charAt(i) is '1' and s.charAt(i + 1) is '0'. Again, they are not equal, so the if condition is satisfied. The value of tmp is calculated as the maximum of i + 1 (which is 2) and n - i - 2 (which is 2). So, tmp is 2. The value of ans is updated to the minimum of ans and tmp, which is now 2.

In the third iteration (i = 2), s.charAt(i) is '0' and s.charAt(i + 1) is '2'. They are not equal, so the if condition is satisfied. The value of tmp is calculated as the maximum of i + 1 (which is 3) and n - i - 2 (which is 1). So, tmp is 3. The value of ans is updated to the minimum of ans and tmp, which remains 2.

The loop ends, and the final value of ans is 2, which is printed as the output.
