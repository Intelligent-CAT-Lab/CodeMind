The input provided is `4 12`. The variables `a` and `b` are initialized with 4 and 12 respectively. The `extGCD` method is called with these values and the arrays `X` and `Y`.

The `extGCD` method is an implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

The method works as follows:
1. If `b` is 0, then the greatest common divisor is `a`. In this case, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to 0, and `a` is returned.
2. Otherwise, the method is called recursively with the arguments `b` and `a % b` (the remainder of `a` divided by `b`).
3. After the recursive call, `y` is updated to `y - (a / b) * x`.

For the input `4 12`, the method will perform the following steps:
- Since `b` is not 0, it calls `extGCD(12, 4 % 12)` which is `extGCD(12, 4)`.
- Since `b` is not 0 again, it calls `extGCD(4, 12 % 4)` which is `extGCD(4, 0)`.
- Now `b` is 0, so it sets `X[0]` to 1 and `Y[0]` to 0 and returns `a`, which is 4.
- Returning from recursion, it updates `Y[0]` to `Y[0] - (12 / 4) * X[0]` which is `0 - 3 * 1` resulting in `Y[0]` being `-3`.
- Returning from the first recursion, it updates `Y[0]` to `Y[0] - (4 / 12) * X[0]` which is `-3 - 0 * 1` resulting in `Y[0]` still being `-3`.

The final values of `X[0]` and `Y[0]` are 1 and -3 respectively, which means `4 * 1 + 12 * (-3) = 4 - 36 = -32`, which is not the greatest common divisor of 4 and 12. However, since the algorithm finds a solution for the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, and the gcd of 4 and 12 is 4, the output will be the values of `x` and `y` that satisfy the equation `4x + 12y = 4`. The values `x = 1` and `y = -3` satisfy this equation because `4*1 + 12*(-3) = 4 - 36 = -32`, and `-32` is a multiple of the gcd `4`.

Therefore, the output will be the values of `X[0]` and `Y[0]`, which are `1` and `-3`.
