<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that sets up an `InputReader` to read from `System.in` and a `PrintWriter` to write to `System.out`. It then creates an instance of `TaskX` and calls its `solve` method.

The `TaskX` class's `solve` method reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using the `InputReader` class. It then adds these integers to a `HashSet<Integer>` called `set`. Since a `HashSet` only contains unique elements, any duplicate numbers will not be added again.

After adding the integers to the set, the method prints the size of the set using `out.println(set.size())`. This will be the number of unique integers among `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Given the input `3 1 4`, the set will contain the numbers {3, 1, 4}. There are no duplicates, so the size of the set is 3.

Finally, the `PrintWriter` is closed, which will flush the output to `System.out`.
