<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main class with a main method that creates an `InputReader` to read from `System.in` and an `OutputWriter` to write to `System.out`. It then creates an instance of `AFerrisWheel` and calls its `solve` method.

The `solve` method reads two integers, `a` and `b`, using the `InputReader`'s `ni()` method, which is a shorthand for `nextInt()`. The input provided is `30 100`, so `a` is set to `30` and `b` is set to `100`.

The `solve` method then has a conditional block that checks:
- If `a` is less than or equal to `5`, it prints `0`.
- Else if `a` is less than `13`, it prints `b / 2`.
- Otherwise, it prints `b`.

Since `a` is `30`, which is greater than `13`, the condition falls through to the else block, and the method prints the value of `b`, which is `100`.

The `OutputWriter`'s `println` method is used to print the result, and then the `OutputWriter` is closed, which flushes the output and closes the underlying `PrintWriter`.

Therefore, the output of the code execution with the input `30 100` will be `100`.
