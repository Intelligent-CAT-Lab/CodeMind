<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `solve` method that prints a matrix of long integers. The size of the matrix to be printed is determined by the input `n`. The matrix `g` is predefined with 10 rows and 10 columns, and the values are hardcoded.

The `main` method sets up the input stream and the print writer, calls the `solve` method, and then flushes the output.

The `solve` method reads an integer `n` from the input, which is the size of the matrix to be printed. It then enters a nested loop to print the first `n` rows and `n` columns of the matrix `g`. After printing each element, it prints a space, and after each row, it prints a newline.

Given the input `3`, the `solve` method will print the top-left 3x3 submatrix of `g`. This submatrix is:
```
0 1 2
1 0 3
2 3 0
```

The `main` method also contains some unused methods for reading different types of input and a debug method `tr` that prints objects if the `INPUT` string is not empty. These methods are not used in the given code execution.
