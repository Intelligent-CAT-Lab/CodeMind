<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value from the input and stores it in the variable 'a'. The input provided is '2', so 'a' is set to 2.

The next line of code calculates the expression `a + (a*a) + (a*a*a)` which is the sum of 'a', 'a' squared, and 'a' cubed. For the input '2', this calculation would be `2 + (2*2) + (2*2*2)` which simplifies to `2 + 4 + 8`.

The final result of the calculation is `14`, and this value is printed to the standard output using `System.out.println`.
