<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable M using sc.nextInt(). According to the input provided, M is assigned the value 21.

The next line of code calculates the expression 48 - M, which is 48 - 21 in this case. The result of this calculation is 27.

Finally, the code prints out the result of the calculation, which is the integer 27.

<<<Output>>>
