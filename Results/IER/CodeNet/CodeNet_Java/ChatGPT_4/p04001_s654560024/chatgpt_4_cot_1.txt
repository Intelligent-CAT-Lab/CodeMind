<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "125" is read and stored in variable s. An integer array num of the same length as s is created to store the numeric values of the characters in s. The for loop converts each character to its corresponding integer value and stores it in the num array. Thus, num will contain [1, 2, 5].

The variable ans is initialized to 0 to store the final result. A for loop is used to iterate over all possible combinations of adding and not adding a plus sign between the digits of the input number. The number of combinations is 2^(s.length()-1), which is 2^(3-1) = 4 in this case.

The inner for loop constructs a binary string index representing whether to add a plus sign ('1') or not ('0') between the digits. For example, "00" means no plus signs, "01" means add a plus sign between the second and third digit, and so on.

The variable count is used to accumulate the sum of the numbers formed by adding plus signs according to the current combination, and instance keeps track of the current number being formed.

For the input "125", the combinations are:
- "00": 125
- "01": 12 + 5
- "10": 1 + 25
- "11": 1 + 2 + 5

The loop calculates the sum for each combination and adds it to ans. The final value of ans after considering all combinations is the output.

The calculations are as follows:
- "00": ans += 125
- "01": ans += 12 + 5
- "10": ans += 1 + 25
- "11": ans += 1 + 2 + 5

Adding these up gives ans = 125 + 17 + 26 + 8 = 176.
