<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read from standard input. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as there are more integers to read.

The input `-3 3` is read and assigned to variables H and R respectively.

The first if condition checks if H is negative and the absolute value of H is equal to R. Since H is `-3` and R is `3`, the absolute value of H (`3`) is indeed equal to R. Therefore, the condition is true.

As a result, the program prints `0` and does not check the other conditions.

Since there is no more input provided, the program will not execute the while loop again and will terminate after printing the output.

<<<Output>>>
0
