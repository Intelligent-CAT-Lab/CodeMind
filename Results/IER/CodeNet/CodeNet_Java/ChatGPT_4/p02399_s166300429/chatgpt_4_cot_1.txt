<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the input, which are 3 and 2 respectively. It then calculates the division of a by b as a double value and stores it in variable c. The division is performed with floating-point division because of the 1.0 factor, resulting in a double value.

The code then prints three values separated by spaces:
1. The result of integer division a/b, which is 3/2 = 1 (since integer division truncates the decimal part).
2. The remainder of the division a%b, which is 3%2 = 1.
3. The result of the floating-point division formatted to 5 decimal places, which is 1.50000 (since 3 divided by 2 is 1.5 and it is formatted to 5 decimal places).

Therefore, the output will be "1 1 1.50000".
<<<Output>>>
1 1 1.50000
