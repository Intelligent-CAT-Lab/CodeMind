<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value from the input and stores it in the variable r. The input provided is `2`, so r is set to 2. The code then calculates the square of r by multiplying r by itself (r * r) and prints the result. Since r is 2, the result of r * r is 2 * 2, which equals 4. The output of the code is therefore the result of this calculation.
<<<Output>>>
4
