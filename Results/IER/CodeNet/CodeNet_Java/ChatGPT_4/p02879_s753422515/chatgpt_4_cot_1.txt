<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two integers, r and s, from the input.
The input provided is `2 5`, so r is assigned the value 2 and s is assigned the value 5.
The code then checks if both r and s are within the range of 1 to 20, which they are.
Next, it checks if both r and s are within the range of 1 to 9. Since both 2 and 5 are within this range, the condition is true.
As the condition is true, the code executes the statement inside the if block, which is to print the product of r and s.
Therefore, the output will be the product of 2 and 5, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
