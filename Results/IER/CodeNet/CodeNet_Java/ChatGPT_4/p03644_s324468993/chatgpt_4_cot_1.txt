<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input. The variable i is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop with the condition i <= n and in each iteration, i is updated to i * 2. The loop starts with i = 1.
The iterations of the loop will be as follows:
- First iteration: i = 1 * 2 = 2 (condition 2 <= 7 is true, continue loop)
- Second iteration: i = 2 * 2 = 4 (condition 4 <= 7 is true, continue loop)
- Third iteration: i = 4 * 2 = 8 (condition 8 <= 7 is false, exit loop)

After exiting the loop, i is divided by 2, so i = 8 / 2 = 4.
The program then prints the value of i, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
