<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables T, R, and Y with the values 1, 6, and 3 respectively. It then calculates the maximum value among T, R, and Y using `Math.max()` function and assigns it to variable A. In this case, A will be 6 since it is the maximum of 1, 6, and 3. Similarly, it calculates the minimum value among T, R, and Y using `Math.min()` function and assigns it to variable B. In this case, B will be 1 since it is the minimum of 1, 6, and 3.

The code then prints the result of A - B, which is 6 - 1 = 5.
