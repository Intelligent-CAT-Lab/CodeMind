The input `0 0 1 2` initializes the variables sx, sy, tx, and ty with 0, 0, 1, and 2 respectively. The `solve` method is then called with these values.

Inside the `solve` method, the differences dx and dy are calculated as follows:
dx = tx - sx = 1 - 0 = 1
dy = ty - sy = 2 - 0 = 2

The `StringBuilder` object `b` is used to build the output string.

The `renzoku` method is called multiple times to append characters to the `StringBuilder` object `b`. This method creates a string with `n` repetitions of the character `c`.

The following steps are performed:
1. Append 'R' repeated dx times (1 time) to `b`: "R"
2. Append 'U' repeated dy times (2 times) to `b`: "RUU"
3. Append 'L' repeated dx times (1 time) to `b`: "RUUL"
4. Append 'D' repeated dy times (2 times) to `b`: "RUULDD"
5. Append 'D' repeated 1 time to `b`: "RUULDDD"
6. Append 'R' repeated (dx + 1) times (2 times) to `b`: "RUULDDDRR"
7. Append 'U' repeated (dy + 1) times (3 times) to `b`: "RUULDDDRRUUU"
8. Append 'L' repeated 1 time to `b`: "RUULDDDRRUUUL"
9. Append 'U' repeated 1 time to `b`: "RUULDDDRRUUULU"
10. Append 'L' repeated (dx + 1) times (2 times) to `b`: "RUULDDDRRUUULULL"
11. Append 'D' repeated (dy + 1) times (3 times) to `b`: "RUULDDDRRUUULULLDDD"
12. Append 'R' repeated 1 time to `b`: "RUULDDDRRUUULULLDDDR"

The final string built by `StringBuilder` object `b` is returned as the output.
