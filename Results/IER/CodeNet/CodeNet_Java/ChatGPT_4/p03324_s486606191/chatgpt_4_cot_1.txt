<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two variables D and N with the values 0 and 5 respectively according to the input. It then calculates the value of num by raising 100 to the power of D, which is 0 in this case. Therefore, num is 1 because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

The code checks if N is equal to 100, and if so, it increments N by 1. However, since N is 5, this condition is not met and N remains 5.

The code then calculates the value of ans by multiplying num (which is 1) by N (which is 5), resulting in ans being 5.

Finally, the code checks if D is 0, which it is, so it prints the value of N, which is 5.

<<<Output>>>
5
