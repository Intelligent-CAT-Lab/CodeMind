<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "BBBWW" is read and converted to a character array `s`. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The program then enters a for loop that iterates from the second character of the array (index 1) to the end of the array.

During each iteration, the program checks if the current character `s[i]` is different from the previous character `s[i - 1]`. If they are different, it increments `ans` by 1.

The loop processes the characters as follows:
- `s[1]` is 'B' and `s[0]` is 'B', so `ans` remains 0.
- `s[2]` is 'B' and `s[1]` is 'B', so `ans` remains 0.
- `s[3]` is 'W' and `s[2]` is 'B', so `ans` is incremented to 1.
- `s[4]` is 'W' and `s[3]` is 'W', so `ans` remains 1.

After the loop finishes, the program prints the final value of `ans`, which is 1.
