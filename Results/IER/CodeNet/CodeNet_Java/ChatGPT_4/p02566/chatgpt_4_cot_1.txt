The input string `abcbcba` is read and converted into a character array `s`. The length of the string `n` is 7.

The `solve` method of the `INumberOfSubstrings` class is called, which calculates the longest common prefix (LCP) array for the suffixes of the string using the `StringUtil.lcpArray` method. This method internally computes the suffix array and then uses it to compute the LCP array.

The LCP array contains the lengths of the longest common prefixes between each pair of consecutive suffixes in the sorted order of suffixes. The LCP array for the input `abcbcba` is calculated as follows:

- The suffix array is computed, which sorts all suffixes of the string. For `abcbcba`, the suffix array would be an array of indices that represent the starting positions of the sorted suffixes.
- Using the suffix array, the LCP array is computed. The LCP array for `abcbcba` would be an array of integers representing the length of the longest common prefix between each pair of consecutive sorted suffixes.

The sum of all elements in the LCP array is then subtracted from the total number of substrings possible in the string `n * (n + 1) / 2`. The total number of substrings in a string of length `n` is given by the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. For `n = 7`, this is `7 * (7 + 1) / 2 = 28`.

The result of this subtraction is the number of distinct substrings in the string `abcbcba`. This result is printed as the output.

However, without executing the code, we cannot determine the exact contents of the LCP array and thus cannot calculate the exact output. The code is complex and involves several algorithms (SA-IS, LCP array construction) that are not trivial to execute manually.

Therefore, we can only describe the process and not the exact output.
