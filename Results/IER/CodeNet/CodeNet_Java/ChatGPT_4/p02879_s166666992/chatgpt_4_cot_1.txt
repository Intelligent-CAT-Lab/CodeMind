<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input, which are 2 and 5, and assigns them to variables a and b, respectively. It then checks if both a and b are less than or equal to 9. Since both 2 and 5 satisfy this condition, the code proceeds to multiply a and b (2 * 5) and prints the result. Therefore, the output will be the product of 2 and 5, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
