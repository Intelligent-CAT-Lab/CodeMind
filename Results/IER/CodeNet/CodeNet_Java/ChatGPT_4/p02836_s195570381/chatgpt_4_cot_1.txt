<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "redcoder". The length of the string `len` is 8.
The function `fun` is called with the input string "redcoder".
Inside the function `fun`, a for loop iterates from 0 to len/2 (which is 4 in this case) to check if the characters at the ith position from the start and the ith position from the end are the same.
The characters at positions 0 and 7 are 'r' and 'r', which are the same, so `res` remains 0.
The characters at positions 1 and 6 are 'e' and 'e', which are the same, so `res` remains 0.
The characters at positions 2 and 5 are 'd' and 'd', which are the same, so `res` remains 0.
The characters at positions 3 and 4 are 'c' and 'o', which are different, so `res` is incremented by 1.
The loop ends as it has reached len/2.
The function returns the value of `res`, which is 1.
The main method prints the returned value, which is 1.
