<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "PD?D??P" is converted to a character array c. The program then iterates over each character in the array.
- The first character 'P' is not 'D' or '?', so it is printed as is.
- The second character 'D' is 'D', so count is incremented by 1 and 'D' is printed.
- The third character '?' is replaced with 'D', count is incremented by 1, and 'D' is printed.
- The fourth character 'D' is 'D', so count is incremented by 1 and 'D' is printed.
- The fifth character '?' is replaced with 'D', count is incremented by 1, and 'D' is printed.
- The sixth character '?' is replaced with 'D', count is incremented by 1, and 'D' is printed.
- The seventh character 'P' is not 'D' or '?', so it is printed as is.
After the loop, the program prints a newline character.
The count variable is not used after incrementing, so it has no effect on the output.
