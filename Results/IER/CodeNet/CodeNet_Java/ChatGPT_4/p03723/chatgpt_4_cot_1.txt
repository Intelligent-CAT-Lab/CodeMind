<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized with 4, 12, and 20 respectively according to the input. The variable count is initialized with 0.

The code enters a while loop that continues as long as A, B, and C are all even numbers. Inside the loop, it first checks if A, B, and C are all equal. If they are, it prints -1 and exits. This is not the case here.

The variables a, b, and c are used to store the current values of A, B, and C before they are updated. The new values of A, B, and C are calculated as follows:
- A becomes the average of the old B and C, which is (12 + 20) / 2 = 16.
- B becomes the average of the old A and C, which is (4 + 20) / 2 = 12.
- C becomes the average of the old A and B, which is (4 + 12) / 2 = 8.

The count is incremented by 1, making it 1.

The loop continues with the new values of A, B, and C (16, 12, 8), which are all still even. The process repeats:
- A becomes (12 + 8) / 2 = 10.
- B becomes (16 + 8) / 2 = 12.
- C becomes (16 + 12) / 2 = 14.

The count is incremented by 1, making it 2.

The loop continues with the new values of A, B, and C (10, 12, 14), but now A is no longer even, so the loop terminates.

The final value of count, which is 2, is printed as the output.
