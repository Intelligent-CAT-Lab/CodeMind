<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and x are initialized with 3, 1, and 5 respectively according to the input. The variable count is initialized with 0.

The code checks if x is greater than or equal to a. Since 5 is greater than 3, it enters the if block.

Inside the if block, it calculates the variable figure as (x - a) / (a - b) + 1, which is (5 - 3) / (3 - 1) + 1 = 2 / 2 + 1 = 2.

Then it calculates count as x % 1000000007 + (figure % 1000000007) * (b % 1000000007), which is 5 % 1000000007 + (2 % 1000000007) * (1 % 1000000007) = 5 + 2 * 1 = 7.

Finally, it prints count % 1000000007, which is 7 % 1000000007 = 7.

<<<Output>>>
