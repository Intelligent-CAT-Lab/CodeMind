<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two strings from the input, concatenates them, and then converts the result into an integer. The input strings "1" and "21" are concatenated to form the string "121", which is then converted to the integer 121.

The code then calculates the square root of the integer value, which is the square root of 121. The square root of 121 is 11, which is a whole number.

The code checks if the square root is an integer by comparing the floor value of the square root to the square root itself. Since the floor of 11 is 11, and 11 equals 11, the condition is true.

Because the condition is true, the code prints "Yes" to indicate that the concatenated number is a perfect square.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
