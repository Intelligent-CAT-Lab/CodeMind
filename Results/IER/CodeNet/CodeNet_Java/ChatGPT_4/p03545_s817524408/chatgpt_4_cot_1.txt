<<<Analysis>>>
The input "1222" is read as a string and stored in variable n. The program then extracts each digit from the string and converts them to integers:
- a is assigned the value 1 (from the first character of the string),
- b is assigned the value 2 (from the second character of the string),
- c is assigned the value 2 (from the third character of the string),
- d is assigned the value 2 (from the fourth character of the string).

The program then checks various combinations of addition and subtraction of these digits to see if they equal 7. It checks these combinations in the following order:
1. a + b + c + d == 7
2. a + b + c - d == 7
3. a + b - c + d == 7
4. a - b + c + d == 7
5. a + b - c - d == 7
6. a - b + c - d == 7
7. a - b - c + d == 7
8. a - b - c - d == 7

For the input "1222", the program will find that the first condition (a + b + c + d == 7) is true because 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 equals 7. Therefore, it will print "1+2+2+2=7" and return, ending the program without checking the remaining conditions.

<<<Output>>>
1+2+2+2=7
