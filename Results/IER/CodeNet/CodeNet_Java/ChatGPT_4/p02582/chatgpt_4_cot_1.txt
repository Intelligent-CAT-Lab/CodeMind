<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "RRS". The variable `res` is initialized with 0.
The code then checks the characters of the string `s` in various if-else conditions to determine the value of `res`.
- The first condition checks if all three characters are 'R'. This is not true for "RRS".
- The second condition checks if the first two characters are 'R'. This is true for "RRS".
- Since the second condition is met, the code sets `res` to 2 and does not check the remaining conditions.
The code then prints the value of `res`, which is 2, and closes the `PrintWriter`.
<<<Output>>>
