<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3`, which is read by the `MyInput` class and passed to the `solve` method of the `TaskB` class as the variable `n`.

The `solve` method checks if `n` is equal to 3. Since the input is indeed 3, the condition is true, and it immediately prints "2 5 63" and returns, skipping the rest of the method's logic.

Therefore, the output is directly determined by this condition and is "2 5 63".

<<<Output>>>
2 5 63
