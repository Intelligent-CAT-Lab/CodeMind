<<<Analysis>>>
The input `725` is read by the `readInt()` method and assigned to the variable `a` in the `a()` method. The `a()` method contains an array `kyu` with values representing the upper bounds of different rating categories. The method iterates through the `kyu` array and checks if the input `a` is less than or equal to each element in the array.

The loop starts with `i = 0` and checks if `725 <= 599`, which is false. It continues to the next iteration with `i = 1` and checks if `725 <= 799`. This condition is true, so the method prints `8 - i`, which is `8 - 1 = 7`.

Therefore, the output will be `7`, which corresponds to the rating category that the input `725` falls into.
