<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an integer variable `odd` with 0. It then enters a for loop that iterates 3 times, corresponding to the 3 integers that will be input by the user.

During each iteration, the code reads an integer from the input using `sc.nextInt()`, calculates the remainder when this integer is divided by 2 (using the modulo operator `%`), and adds this remainder to the `odd` variable. The remainder will be 1 if the number is odd, and 0 if the number is even.

Given the input `1 1 10`, the code processes it as follows:
- First iteration: reads 1, which is odd, so `odd` becomes 0 + 1 = 1.
- Second iteration: reads another 1, which is also odd, so `odd` becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
- Third iteration: reads 10, which is even, so `odd` remains 2.

After the loop, the code checks if `odd` is greater than or equal to 2. Since `odd` is 2, the condition is true, and the code prints "Hom".
