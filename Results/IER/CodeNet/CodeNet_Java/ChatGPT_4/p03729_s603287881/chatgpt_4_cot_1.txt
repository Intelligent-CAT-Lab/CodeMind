<<<Analysis>>>
The Scanner object named Input is created to read from the standard input.
Three strings A, B, and C are read from the input and are assigned the values "rng", "gorilla", and "apple" respectively.
The if condition checks whether the last character of A ('g') is the same as the first character of B ('g'), and whether the last character of B ('a') is the same as the first character of C ('a').
Since both conditions are true ('g' == 'g' and 'a' == 'a'), the if block will execute and "YES" will be printed to the standard output.
<<<Output>>>
YES
