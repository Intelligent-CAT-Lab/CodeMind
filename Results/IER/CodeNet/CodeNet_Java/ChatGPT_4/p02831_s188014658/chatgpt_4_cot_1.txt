<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers A and B. The input provided is `2 3`.

1. The Scanner object `sc` is created to read input from the standard input (keyboard).
2. The program reads two integers A and B using `sc.nextInt()`, which are 2 and 3 respectively.
3. The `lcm` method is called with arguments 2 and 3.
4. Inside the `lcm` method, it calls the `gcd` method to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2 and 3.
5. The `gcd` method checks if the first number (m) is less than the second number (n), which is not the case here (2 is not less than 3).
6. Then it checks if the second number (n) is 0, which is also not the case here (3 is not 0).
7. The `gcd` method is called recursively with the second number (n) and the remainder of the first number (m) divided by the second number (n), which is `gcd(3, 2 % 3)`.
8. In the next recursive call, since 2 is less than 3, the `gcd` method swaps the numbers and calls `gcd(3, 2)`.
9. Again, it checks if 2 is 0, which is not the case.
10. The `gcd` method is called recursively with `gcd(2, 3 % 2)`, which is `gcd(2, 1)`.
11. The process continues until the second number (n) becomes 0, at which point the first number (m) is returned as the GCD. In this case, the GCD of 2 and 3 is 1 because they are coprime.
12. The `lcm` method then calculates the LCM by multiplying the two numbers and dividing by their GCD, which is `2 * 3 / 1`.
13. The result of the LCM calculation is 6.
14. The program prints the result, which is 6.
