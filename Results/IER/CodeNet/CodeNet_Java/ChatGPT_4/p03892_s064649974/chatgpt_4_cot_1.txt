The input values are assigned to variables a, b, c, and d as follows: a=1, b=1, c=3, d=4. The variables dx and dy are calculated as the absolute differences between the coordinates (a, b) and (c, d), resulting in dx=2 and dy=3.

The method help is called with the minimum and maximum values of dx and dy, which are 2 and 3, respectively.

Inside the help method, since w is not 0, it proceeds to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of w and h, which are 2 and 3. The gcd method is called with these values.

In the gcd method, since a (2) is not less than b (3), it skips the initial swap. It then enters a while loop to find the gcd. Since 2 % 3 is not 0, it calculates a new value for c as 2 % 3, which is 2. The values of a and b are then set to 3 and 2, respectively. In the next iteration, 3 % 2 is 1, which is not 0, so c becomes 1, and a and b are set to 2 and 1, respectively. In the final iteration, 2 % 1 is 0, so the loop exits, and the gcd method returns the current value of b, which is 1.

Back in the help method, since the gcd c is 1, it returns w + h - 1, which is 2 + 3 - 1, resulting in 4.

The final answer is printed, which is 4.
