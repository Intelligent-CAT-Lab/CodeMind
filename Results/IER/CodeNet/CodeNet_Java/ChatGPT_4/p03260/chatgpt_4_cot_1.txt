<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, n and k, from the input. In this case, n is assigned the value 3 and k is assigned the value 1.

The code then checks if the product of n and k is odd by using the modulo operator (%). It does this by checking if (n * k) % 2 is equal to 1. If the result is 1, it means the product is odd, and the code prints "Yes". If the result is not 1 (i.e., it is 0), it means the product is even, and the code prints "No".

For the given input `3 1`, the product of n and k is 3 * 1 = 3. Since 3 is an odd number, (3 * 1) % 2 equals 1. Therefore, the condition in the if statement is true, and the code will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
