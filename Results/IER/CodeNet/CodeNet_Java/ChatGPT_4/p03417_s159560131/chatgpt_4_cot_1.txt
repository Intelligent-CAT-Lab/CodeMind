<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers from the input, which are 2 and 2, and assigns them to variables n and m respectively. Then it closes the Scanner object.
It calculates the expression (n-2) * (m-2), which becomes (2-2) * (2-2) = 0 * 0 = 0.
Since the absolute value of 0 is 0, the code prints out 0 as the result.
<<<Output>>>
0
