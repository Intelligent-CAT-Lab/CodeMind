<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `0`. The variable `n` is initialized with the value `0`. The variable `ans1` is calculated by dividing `n` by `30`, which results in `0` because `0 / 30` is `0`. The variable `n` is then updated with the remainder of `n` divided by `30`, which is still `0` because `0 % 30` is `0`. The variable `ans2` is calculated by multiplying `n` by `2`, which results in `0` because `0 * 2` is `0`. Finally, the program prints the values of `ans1` and `ans2` separated by a space, which are both `0`. So the output will be `0 0`.
