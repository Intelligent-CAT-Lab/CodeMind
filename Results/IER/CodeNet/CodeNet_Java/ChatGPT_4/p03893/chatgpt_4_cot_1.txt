The variable x is initialized with the value 2 according to the input. The variable next is initialized with the value 2.
It enters a for loop and iterates 2 times because x is 2.
In the first iteration (i = 0), next is updated to (2 + 1) * 2 which is 6.
In the second iteration (i = 1), next is updated to (6 + 1) * 2 which is 14.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of next as output, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
