<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` that implements `Runnable` and contains a `main` method that starts a new thread with the `run` method of the `Main` class. The `run` method is where the actual logic of the program is executed.

The `InputReader` class is used to read input from the standard input stream. It has methods to read different types of data, such as `nextInt`, `nextLong`, `nextDouble`, `readString`, and `next`.

The `run` method creates an instance of `InputReader` to read two integers `n` and `b` from the input. In this case, the input provided is `11 2`.

The program then calculates the minimum number of times you need to multiply the number `b` by itself to get a number greater than or equal to `n`. This is done by using the formula `Math.ceil(Math.log((double)n)/Math.log((double)b))`.

For the given input `11 2`, the calculation is as follows:
- `Math.log((double)11)` calculates the natural logarithm of 11.
- `Math.log((double)2)` calculates the natural logarithm of 2.
- The division of these two logarithms gives the logarithm base 2 of 11.
- `Math.ceil` is then used to round up to the nearest whole number.

The program also checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, the program prints "1" because any number to the power of 0 is 1. However, in this case, `n` is not 1.

For the input `11 2`, the logarithm base 2 of 11 is approximately 3.4594. When we apply `Math.ceil`, it rounds up to 4.

Therefore, the minimum number of times you need to multiply 2 by itself to get a number greater than or equal to 11 is 4 (because 2^4 = 16, which is greater than 11).

Finally, the program prints the result and closes the `PrintWriter`.
