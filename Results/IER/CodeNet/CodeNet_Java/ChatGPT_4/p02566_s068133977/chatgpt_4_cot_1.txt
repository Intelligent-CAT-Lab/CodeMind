The input string `abcbcba` is read and converted into a character array `s`. The length of the string `n` is 7.

The `lcp` (Longest Common Prefix) array is calculated for the suffixes of the string using the `StringUtil.lcpArray(s)` method. This method first converts the character array `s` into an integer array `is` where each character is represented by its ASCII value. Then, it computes the suffix array `sa` for the integer array `is` using the `StringUtil.suffixArray(is, 255)` method. The suffix array `sa` contains the starting indices of all the suffixes of the string sorted in lexicographical order.

After obtaining the suffix array `sa`, the `StringUtil.lcpArray(is, sa)` method computes the LCP array. The LCP array `lcp` contains the lengths of the longest common prefixes between each pair of consecutive suffixes in the sorted order.

The output is calculated as the total number of substrings of the string minus the sum of the LCP array. The total number of substrings of a string of length `n` is given by `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This is because each substring can be uniquely identified by its starting and ending indices, and there are `n` choices for the starting index and `n + 1` choices for the ending index (including the empty substring at the end).

The sum of the LCP array is calculated using `IntMath.sum(lcp)`. This sum represents the number of repeated characters in all the substrings when considering the sorted suffixes.

Finally, the result is printed using `out.ans(result).ln()`, which prints the result followed by a newline.

Let's calculate the LCP array for the input `abcbcba`:
- Suffixes in lexicographical order: a, abcbcba, bcbcba, bcba, cba, cbca, cca
- Suffix array `sa`: [6, 0, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3]
- LCP array `lcp`: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Total number of substrings: 7 * (7 + 1) / 2 = 28
Sum of LCP array: 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2

Output: 28 - 2 = 26
