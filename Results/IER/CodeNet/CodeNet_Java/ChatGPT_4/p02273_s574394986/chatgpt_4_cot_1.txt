<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `1`, which is assigned to the variable `n`. The program prints the coordinates of the first point (0.0, 0.0). Then it calls the `kock` function with `n`, and two points `p1` (0.0, 0.0) and `p2` (100.0, 0.0).

Inside the `kock` function, it first checks if `n` is 0, which it is not, so it proceeds. It calculates three new points `s`, `t`, and `u` which are the division points for creating the Koch curve.

The coordinates of `s` are calculated as (2.0*0.0+100.0)/3.0 for `x` and (2.0*0.0+0.0)/3.0 for `y`, which results in (66.66666666666667, 0.0).
The coordinates of `t` are calculated as (0.0+2.0*100.0)/3.0 for `x` and (0.0+2.0*0.0)/3.0 for `y`, which results in (33.333333333333336, 0.0).
The coordinates of `u` are calculated using the formula provided, which results in (50.0, 28.867513459481287).

The function then recursively calls itself four times with decremented `n` (n-1) and different pairs of points, but since `n` is 1, it will only print the points `s`, `u`, and `t` and not recurse further.

After the recursive calls and prints, the program prints the coordinates of the last point (100.0, 0.0).

The output will be the coordinates of the points `s`, `u`, `t`, and the last point, each on a new line, with the first and last points printed by the `main` method and the intermediate points printed by the `kock` function.
