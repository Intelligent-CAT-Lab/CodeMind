<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `4`. The main method creates an instance of `MyInput` and `Solver`, and then calls the `solve` method of the `Solver` class.

The `solve` method takes the input `N` which is `4` and initializes two variables `total` and `diff` to 0, and `max` to 0.

The method enters a for loop that starts with `i=1` and will go up to `N` which is `4`. Inside the loop, it calculates the total of the first `i` natural numbers using the formula `total = (i+1) * i / 2`. It then checks if `total` is greater than or equal to `N`.

For `i=1`, `total = (1+1) * 1 / 2 = 1`, which is not greater than or equal to `N`.
For `i=2`, `total = (2+1) * 2 / 2 = 3`, which is still not greater than or equal to `N`.
For `i=3`, `total = (3+1) * 3 / 2 = 6`, which is greater than `N`.

When `i=3`, the condition `total >= N` is met, so `max` is set to `3` and `diff` is set to `total - N`, which is `6 - 4 = 2`.

The loop breaks and another for loop starts from `i=1` to `max` which is `3`. It prints the value of `i` unless `i` is equal to `diff`. Since `diff` is `2`, the numbers `1` and `3` will be printed.
