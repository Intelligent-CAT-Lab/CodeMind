<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two values as strings and constructs two BigInteger objects, a and b, with these values.

The input provided is "5 8". Therefore, BigInteger a is initialized with the value 5 and BigInteger b is initialized with the value 8.

The code then subtracts BigInteger b from BigInteger a using the subtract method of the BigInteger class. Since 5 - 8 results in -3, the BigInteger a now holds the value -3.

Finally, the code prints the value of BigInteger a to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
-3
