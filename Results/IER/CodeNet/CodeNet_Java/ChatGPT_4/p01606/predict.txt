The input `10 2` initializes `n` with 10 and `w` with 2. The `solve` method is then called.

The `flag` array is used to keep track of which numbers are currently considered "determined" (true) or not (false). The `count` array is used to count how many times a number is a divisor of any number in the current window of size `w`.

The `sum` variable keeps track of the total number of "determined" numbers, which starts at 0. The `left` and `right` variables define the current window of numbers being considered, starting with `left` at 1 and `right` at `w+1` (which is 3).

The first for-loop initializes the `count` array and the `flag` array for the first window (from 1 to `w`, which is 2). It increments the count for each divisor of each number `i` in the range [1, w) and calls `update` to adjust the `flag` array and `sum` accordingly.

The second for-loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - w` (from 0 to 8). In each iteration, it adjusts the `left` and `right` to the new window, decrements the count for divisors of `i`, increments the count for divisors of `i + w`, and calls `update` to adjust the `flag` array and `sum` accordingly.

The `update` method checks if a number `i` is within the current window (`left <= i && i < right`). If a number is no longer in the window and its count is less than 2, it is no longer "determined" and `sum` is decremented. If a number is in the window or its count is at least 2, it becomes "determined" and `sum` is incremented.

The `print` method is called to output the current `sum` followed by a space if `i < n - w`, or a newline if it's the last iteration.

The expected output is the `sum` of "determined" numbers after each iteration of the second for-loop.

Let's calculate the output step by step:

1. For `i = 0`, the window is [1, 3). The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2, so `count[1]` and `count[2]` are incremented. Both 1 and 2 are within the window, so `sum` becomes 2.
2. For `i = 1`, the window is [2, 4). The divisors of 1 (1) are decremented, and the divisors of 3 (1 and 3) are incremented. 1 is no longer in the window, so `sum` remains 2.
3. For `i = 2`, the window is [3, 5). The divisors of 2 (1 and 2) are decremented, and the divisors of 4 (1, 2, and 4) are incremented. 2 is no longer in the window, so `sum` remains 2.
4. For `i = 3`, the window is [4, 6). The divisors of 3 (1 and 3) are decremented, and the divisors of 5 (1 and 5) are incremented. 3 is no longer in the window, so `sum` remains 2.
5. For `i = 4`, the window is [5, 7). The divisors of 4 (1, 2, and 4) are decremented, and the divisors of 6 (1, 2, 3, and 6) are incremented. 4 is no longer in the window, so `sum` remains 2.
6. For `i = 5`, the window is [6, 8). The divisors of 5 (1 and 5) are decremented, and the divisors of 7 (1 and 7) are incremented. 5 is no longer in the window, so `sum` remains 2.
7. For `i = 6`, the window is [7, 9). The divisors of 6 (1, 2, 3, and 6) are decremented, and the divisors of 8 (1, 2, 4, and 8) are incremented. 6 is no longer in the window, so `sum` remains 2.
8. For `i = 7`, the window is [8, 10). The divisors of 7 (1 and 7
