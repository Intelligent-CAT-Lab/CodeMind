<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized with 10 and 20 respectively according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with Long.MAX_VALUE, which is the maximum value a long can have in Java.

The code then checks four conditions to find the minimum number of operations required to convert x to y by either incrementing, decrementing, or inverting the sign of x.

1. If x is less than or equal to y, it calculates the difference (y - x) and updates ans if this value is smaller than the current ans. In this case, 20 - 10 = 10, so ans is updated to 10.

2. If the negative of x is less than or equal to y, it calculates (y + x + 1) and updates ans if this value is smaller. In this case, 20 + 10 + 1 = 31, which is not smaller than the current ans, so ans remains 10.

3. If x is less than or equal to the negative of y, it calculates (-y - x + 1) and updates ans if this value is smaller. In this case, -20 - 10 + 1 = -29, which is not smaller than the current ans, so ans remains 10.

4. If the negative of x is less than or equal to the negative of y, it calculates (-y + x + 2) and updates ans if this value is smaller. In this case, -20 + 10 + 2 = -8, which is not smaller than the current ans, so ans remains 10.

After evaluating all conditions, the smallest value found is 10, which is the direct difference between y and x. Therefore, the output will be 10.
