The input string "RUDLUDR" is read and stored in the variable s. The variable ans is initialized with the value "Yes". The string s is split into an array of single characters and stored in the array ch.

The for loop iterates over each character in the array ch. The loop has a condition that checks if the character at an even index (0-based) is one of "R", "U", or "D" and if the character at an odd index is one of "L", "U", or "D". If a character does not meet these conditions, the value of ans is changed to "No".

Let's analyze each character of the input string "RUDLUDR" based on its index:
- Index 0: 'R' (even index) - valid since 'R' is allowed at even indices.
- Index 1: 'U' (odd index) - valid since 'U' is allowed at odd indices.
- Index 2: 'D' (even index) - valid since 'D' is allowed at even indices.
- Index 3: 'L' (odd index) - valid since 'L' is allowed at odd indices.
- Index 4: 'U' (even index) - invalid since 'U' is not allowed at even indices.
- Index 5: 'D' (odd index) - valid since 'D' is allowed at odd indices.
- Index 6: 'R' (even index) - valid since 'R' is allowed at even indices.

Since the character at index 4 does not meet the condition for an even index, the value of ans is changed to "No".

After the loop finishes, the final value of ans, which is "No", is printed as the output.
