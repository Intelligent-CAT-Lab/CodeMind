<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `2 4`, so `n` is initialized to 2 and `k` is initialized to 4. The variable `p` is set to 998244353, which is a large prime number often used in modular arithmetic problems.

The code then initializes two arrays `f` and `fi` of size `k` (4 in this case). The array `f` is used to store factorial values modulo `p`, and `fi` is used to store modular inverses of those factorial values.

The first for loop calculates the factorial values modulo `p` and stores them in `f`. It starts with `f[0] = 1` and for each `i` from 1 to `k-1` (3 in this case), it calculates `f[i] = (f[i - 1] * i) % p`. The values of `f` after this loop will be `[1, 1, 2, 6]`.

The second for loop calculates the modular inverses of the factorial values and stores them in `fi`. It starts with `fi[k - 1] = inv(f[k - 1], p)`, which is the modular inverse of `f[3] = 6` modulo `p`. The `inv` function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse. The values of `fi` after this loop will be `[1, 332748118, 498122177, 166374059]`.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 1. The third for loop doubles `ans` `k-1` times (3 times in this case), reducing it modulo `p` if it becomes equal to or greater than `p`. After this loop, `ans` will be 8.

The fourth for loop subtracts a certain value from `ans` for each `i` from 0 to `min(n - 1, k)` (which is 1 in this case). The value subtracted is `(((f[k - 1] * fi[i]) % p) * fi[k - 1 - i]) % p`. For `i = 0`, this value is `(((6 * 1) % p) * 166374059) % p`, which is `997682207`. So, `ans` becomes `8 - 997682207`.

Since `ans` is now negative, the final print statement adds `p` to `ans` to make it positive before printing it. Therefore, the final value of `ans` is `8 - 997682207 + 998244353`, which is `562154`.
