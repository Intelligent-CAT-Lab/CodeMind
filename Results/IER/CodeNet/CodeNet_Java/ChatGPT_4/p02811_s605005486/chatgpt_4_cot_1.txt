<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `2 900`. The main method initializes an InputReader object `in` with the System input stream and a PrintWriter object `out` with the System output stream. It then creates an instance of the Task class and calls the `solve` method on it, passing the test number (0 in this case, as it is not used), the InputReader `in`, and the PrintWriter `out`.

The `solve` method reads two integers from the input using the `nextInt` method of the InputReader class. These integers are stored in variables `n` and `m`, which are assigned the values 2 and 900, respectively.

The `solve` method then checks if `n * 500` is greater than or equal to `m`. In this case, `2 * 500` equals 1000, which is indeed greater than 900. Therefore, the condition is true.

Since the condition is true, the program prints "Yes" to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
