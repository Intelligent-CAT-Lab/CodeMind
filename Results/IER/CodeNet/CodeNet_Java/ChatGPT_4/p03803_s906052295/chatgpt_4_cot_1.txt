<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to compare two integers, `a` and `b`, and determine the winner of a game based on the values of `a` and `b`. The rules of the game are as follows:
- If `a` and `b` are equal, the result is a "Draw".
- If `a` is 1, "Alice" wins.
- If `b` is 1, "Bob" wins.
- If `a` is less than `b`, "Bob" wins.
- If `a` is greater than `b`, "Alice" wins.

The code uses a `FastScanner` class to read the input from `System.in`. The `fgetInt()` method is used to read the two integers `a` and `b`. The input provided is `8 6`, so `a` is assigned the value 8 and `b` is assigned the value 6.

The code then proceeds to the conditional checks:
- Since `a` is not equal to `b`, it is not a "Draw".
- Since `a` is not 1, "Alice" does not automatically win.
- Since `b` is not 1, "Bob" does not automatically win.
- Since `a` (8) is greater than `b` (6), "Alice" wins.

The `println` method of the `PrintWriter` class is used to print the result, and the `suomi` method is called to flush the output stream.

Therefore, the output of the code will be "Alice".
