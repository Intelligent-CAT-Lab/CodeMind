<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with three integer instance variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The `input()` method reads three integers from the standard input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The `output()` method checks if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

In the `main` method, an instance of `Main` is created, and the `input()` method is called to read the input `1 3 8`. The values are assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c` as 1, 3, and 8 respectively. Then the `output()` method is called.

The condition `a < b && b < c` is checked. Since `1 < 3` and `3 < 8` are both true, the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
