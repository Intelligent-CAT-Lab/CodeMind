The variable d is initialized with 1.000 according to the input.
The variable e is initialized by casting d to an int and adding 1, which results in 1.0 + 1 = 2.0.
Then, e is reassigned to the maximum value between the current e (2.0) and the expression d / Math.sqrt(2) * 2. The expression is evaluated as follows:
1.000 / Math.sqrt(2) * 2
= 1.000 / 1.4142135623730951 * 2
= 0.7071067811865475 * 2
= 1.414213562373095
Since 2.0 is greater than 1.414213562373095, e remains 2.0.
Finally, the value of e (2.0) is printed out.
<<<Output>>>
2.0
