<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is "3776". The Scanner class is used to read this input and assign it to the variable word. The program then enters a for loop that iterates over the characters of the word, checking if there are any consecutive characters that are the same.

The loop starts with i=0 and checks if the character at position i is the same as the character at position i+1. The loop continues to check for consecutive characters until it reaches the second to last character of the word.

For the given input "3776", the loop will find that the character at position 1 ('7') is the same as the character at position 2 ('7'). When this condition is met, the flag is set to true, and the loop breaks.

After the loop, the program checks the value of the flag. Since the flag is true, indicating that there are consecutive characters that are the same, the program prints "Bad".

<<<Output>>>
Bad
