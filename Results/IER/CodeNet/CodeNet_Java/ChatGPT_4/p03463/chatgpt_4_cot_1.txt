<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three integer variables n, a, and b with the values 5, 2, and 4 respectively according to the input. Then it calculates the difference between b and a, which is k = 4 - 2 = 2.
It checks if k is odd by taking the modulus of k with 2. Since k is 2, k % 2 equals 0, which means k is even.
Because k is even, the code prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
