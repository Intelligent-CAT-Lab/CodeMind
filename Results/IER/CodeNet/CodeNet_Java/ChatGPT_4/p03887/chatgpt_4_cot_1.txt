The input `3 1 2 0` initializes the variables n, a, b, and c with 3, 1, 2, and 0 respectively. The `solve` method is called with these values.

The `solve` method first checks if b is odd, which it is not (b = 2), so it continues.

A `ModCalculator` is created with a modulus of 1_000_000_007L, and a `ModCombinationCache` is created using this calculator.

The `solve` method then enters a for loop with x starting from a (1) and decreasing to 0. Inside this loop, the following steps occur:

1. `group1` is assigned the value of x (which will be 1 and then 0 in the two iterations).
2. `restA` is calculated as a - x (which will be 0 and then 1).
3. `group2` is assigned the value of `restA`.
4. `restC1` is calculated as c - `restA` (which will be 0 and then -1).
5. If `restC1` is negative, the loop breaks, so the second iteration will not complete.
6. Since b is greater than 0, another loop starts with y ranging from 0 to `restC1` / 3 (which will be 0 in the first iteration).
7. `group3` is assigned the value of y (which will be 0).
8. `restC2` is calculated as `restC1` - 3 * y (which will be 0).
9. `group4` is assigned the value of b / 2 (which will be 1).

The following calculations are then performed using the `ModCombinationCache`:

- `count` is calculated as the combination of (b / 2 + `restC2` - 1) choose (b / 2 - 1), which simplifies to C(1, 0) = 1.
- `count` is then multiplied by the combination of (group1 + group2 + group3 + group4) choose group4, which simplifies to C(2, 1) = 2.
- `count` is then multiplied by the combination of (group1 + group2 + group3) choose group3, which simplifies to C(2, 0) = 1.
- `count` is then multiplied by the combination of (group1 + group2) choose group2, which simplifies to C(1, 0) = 1.

The final `count` is 2, and `answer` is updated to be the sum of itself and `count`, which is 2.

Since `restC1` becomes negative in the second iteration of the outer loop, the loop breaks, and no further calculations are done.

The `solve` method returns the value of `answer`, which is 2.

The `execute` method prints this value, and the `main` method flushes the output.
