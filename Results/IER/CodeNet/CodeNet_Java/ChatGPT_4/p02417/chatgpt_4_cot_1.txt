<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It also initializes an integer array `res` of size 26 to store the frequency of each letter of the alphabet.

The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as there is more input to read. Inside the loop, it reads a line of input into the string `str`.

For each character in `str`, the code checks if the character is an uppercase letter (between 'A' and 'Z') or a lowercase letter (between 'a' and 'z'). If it is, it increments the corresponding index in the `res` array. The index is determined by subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' (65) or 'a' (97) from the ASCII value of the character to get a range from 0 to 25.

After processing the input, the code iterates over the `res` array and prints the frequency of each letter in the format 'letter : frequency'.

Given the input "This is a pen.", the code will count the frequency of each letter (ignoring case and non-letter characters) and then print the frequencies of all letters from 'a' to 'z'.

The input "This is a pen." contains:
- 1 'T'/'t'
- 1 'H'/'h'
- 3 'I'/'i'
- 1 'S'/'s'
- 2 'A'/'a'
- 1 'P'/'p'
- 1 'E'/'e'
- 1 'N'/'n'

All other letters have a frequency of 0.
