The variable n is initialized with the string "100" according to the input.
The variable f is initialized with true.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of n, which is 3 in this case.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at position i in the string n is not '9'. If it finds a character that is not '9', it sets f to false and breaks out of the loop.
In this case, the characters at positions 1 and 2 in the string "100" are '0' which are not '9', so f is set to false and the loop breaks.
After the loop, the ternary operator checks the value of f. Since f is false, the variable c is set to '1'.
The variable ans is calculated as follows: the character at position 0 of n ('1') is converted to its integer value (49 in ASCII) and then '1' (also 49 in ASCII) is subtracted from it, resulting in 0. Then, the length of n minus 1 (which is 2) is multiplied by 9, resulting in 18. The final value of ans is 0 + 18, which is 18.
The output is the value of ans, which is 18.
