<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three integers x, a, and b with the values 5, 2, and 7 respectively according to the input. It then compares the absolute difference between x and a, and x and b. The absolute difference between x and a is |5 - 2| = 3, and the absolute difference between x and b is |5 - 7| = 2. Since the absolute difference between x and a is greater than the absolute difference between x and b, the condition in the if statement evaluates to false. Therefore, the else block is executed, and "B" is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
B
