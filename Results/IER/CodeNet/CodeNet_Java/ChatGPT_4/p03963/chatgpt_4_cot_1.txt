<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with the value of K, which is 2.
It enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to N, which is 2 in this case. Since the loop starts from 2 and ends at N, it will only execute once for i=2.
Inside the loop, ans is updated by multiplying its current value by (K-1). Since K is 2, (K-1) is 1.
Therefore, ans is updated as follows:
ans = ans * (K-1) = 2 * (2-1) = 2 * 1 = 2
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output, which is 2.
