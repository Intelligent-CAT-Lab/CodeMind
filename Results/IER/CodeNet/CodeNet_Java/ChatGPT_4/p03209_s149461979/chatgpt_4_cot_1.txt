The code defines a class `Main` with a nested static class `FastScanner` for fast input reading, and a recursive method `count` that uses memoization to compute some value based on the inputs `n` and `x`.

The `main` method initializes a `FastScanner` object to read two inputs: `n` and `x`, which are 2 and 7 respectively. It then initializes an array of `HashMap` objects called `cache` to store computed values for the `count` method to avoid redundant calculations.

The `count` method is called with the inputs `n`, `x`, and the `cache`. The method computes the value recursively as follows:

1. If `n` is 0, it returns 1.
2. If `x` is 1, it returns 0.
3. It checks if the value for the current `n` and `x` is already computed and stored in the cache. If so, it returns the cached value.
4. It calculates `layers_n_1` as `(1 << (n + 1)) - 3`, which is `2^(n+1) - 3`. For `n = 2`, `layers_n_1` is `2^3 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5`.
5. It then checks if `x` is greater than `2 + layers_n_1`. For `n = 2` and `x = 7`, `x` is not greater than `2 + 5`, so it skips this condition.
6. It checks if `x` is equal to `2 + layers_n_1`. For `n = 2` and `x = 7`, `x` is equal to `2 + 5`, so it computes `1 + count(n - 1, layers_n_1, cache)`. This means it calls `count(1, 5, cache)`.
7. The recursive call `count(1, 5, cache)` will then perform its own set of checks. Since `n` is not 0 and `x` is not 1, it calculates `layers_n_1` for `n = 1`, which is `2^2 - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1`. Since `x` is greater than `2 + layers_n_1` (5 > 2 + 1), it computes `1 + count(0, 5 - 1 - 2, cache) + count(0, 1, cache)`. This results in `1 + count(0, 2, cache) + count(0, 1, cache)`.
8. `count(0, 2, cache)` returns 1 because `n` is 0.
9. `count(0, 1, cache)` returns 0 because `x` is 1.
10. So `count(1, 5, cache)` returns `1 + 1 + 0 = 2`.
11. Finally, `count(2, 7, cache)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

The final result is printed to the console, which is the value returned by `count(2, 7, cache)`.
