<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 2 1` initializes the variables n, m, and d with the values 2, 2, and 1 respectively. The string `colors` is initialized with "RYGB".

The outer for loop runs for n iterations, which is 2 in this case, representing the rows. The inner for loop runs for m iterations, which is also 2 in this case, representing the columns.

For each cell (i, j) in the 2x2 grid, the following calculations are performed:
- k is calculated as `(i + j) % (2 * d)`. Since d is 1, k is `(i + j) % 2`.
- l is calculated as `(i - j) % (2 * d)`. Since d is 1, l is `(i - j) % 2`. If l is negative, it is adjusted to be within the range [0, 2 * d) by adding `2 * d` and taking the modulus again.
- col is calculated as `(k / d) * 2 + (l / d)`. Since d is 1, col is `k * 2 + l`.

The character at index `col` in the string `colors` is printed for each cell.

Let's calculate the output for each cell:
- For cell (0, 0): k = 0, l = 0, col = 0, the character is 'R'.
- For cell (0, 1): k = 1, l = 1, col = 3, the character is 'B'.
- For cell (1, 0): k = 1, l = 1, col = 3, the character is 'B'.
- For cell (1, 1): k = 0, l = 0, col = 0, the character is 'R'.

The output will be a 2x2 grid with the characters 'R', 'B', 'B', 'R' in the specified order.
