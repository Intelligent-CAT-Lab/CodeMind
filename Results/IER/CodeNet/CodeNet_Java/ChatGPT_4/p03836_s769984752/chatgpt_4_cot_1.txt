The variables sx, sy, tx, and ty are initialized with 0, 0, 1, and 2 respectively according to the input.

The first for loop will iterate tx-sx times, which is 1-0 = 1 time, printing "R" once.
The second for loop will iterate ty-sy times, which is 2-0 = 2 times, printing "U" twice.
The third for loop will again iterate tx-sx times, which is 1-0 = 1 time, printing "L" once.
The fourth for loop will again iterate ty-sy times, which is 2-0 = 2 times, printing "D" twice.

After the first set of loops, the output is "RUULD".

Then, "D" is printed once.
The fifth for loop will iterate tx-sx+1 times, which is 1-0+1 = 2 times, printing "R" twice.
The sixth for loop will iterate ty-sy+1 times, which is 2-0+1 = 3 times, printing "U" three times.
Then, "L" is printed once.

After the second set of loops, the output is "RUULDDRRUUUL".

Then, "U" is printed once.
The seventh for loop will iterate tx-sx+1 times, which is 1-0+1 = 2 times, printing "L" twice.
The eighth for loop will iterate ty-sy+1 times, which is 2-0+1 = 3 times, printing "D" three times.
Finally, "R" is printed once.

After the third set of loops, the output is "RUULDDRRUUULLUULDDDR".

Combining all the parts, the final output is "RUULDDRRUUULLUULDDDR".
