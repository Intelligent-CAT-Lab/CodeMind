<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read from standard input. It then reads three integers x, a, and b with the values 5, 2, and 7 respectively according to the input provided.

The variable ans is initialized with the string "A". The code then checks if the absolute difference between x and a is greater than the absolute difference between x and b. The absolute differences are calculated as follows:
- Math.abs(x - a) = Math.abs(5 - 2) = 3
- Math.abs(x - b) = Math.abs(5 - 7) = 2

Since 3 (the absolute difference between x and a) is greater than 2 (the absolute difference between x and b), the condition is true, and the value of ans is changed to "B".

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is "B".

<<<Output>>>
B
