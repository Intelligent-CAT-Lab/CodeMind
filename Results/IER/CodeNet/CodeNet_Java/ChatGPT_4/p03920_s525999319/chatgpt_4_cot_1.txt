<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 4 according to the input.
The variable N is calculated using the formula (int) (Math.sqrt(8*k + 1) - 1) / 2 which results in (int) (Math.sqrt(8*4 + 1) - 1) / 2 = (int) (Math.sqrt(33) - 1) / 2 = (int) (5.744 - 1) / 2 = (int) 4.744 / 2 = (int) 2.372 = 2.
The variable missing is initialized with 0.
The if condition checks if N*(N + 1)/2 < k, which is 2*(2 + 1)/2 < 4, which is 3 < 4, which is false. So the if block is not executed and missing remains 0.
The for loop iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), which means from 1 to 2. Since missing is 0, the condition j != missing is always true for j = 1 and j = 2.
The loop prints the numbers 1 and 2.
