<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. The variable cnt is initialized with a BigInteger value of 0.
The code enters a nested for loop, with both loops iterating from 1 to n (inclusive). For each pair of i and j, it checks if the product of i and j is less than n.
The pairs (i, j) that will be checked are:
(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

For each pair, the following happens:
- (1, 1): 1 * 1 < 3, cnt becomes 1
- (1, 2): 1 * 2 < 3, cnt becomes 2
- (1, 3): 1 * 3 is not less than 3, break the inner loop
- (2, 1): 2 * 1 < 3, cnt becomes 3
- (2, 2): 2 * 2 is not less than 3, break the inner loop
- (3, 1): 3 * 1 is not less than 3, break the inner loop

The inner loop breaks whenever the product of i and j is not less than n, so it does not continue to unnecessary iterations.

After the nested loops finish, the final value of cnt is 3, which is the number of pairs (i, j) where the product is less than n.
