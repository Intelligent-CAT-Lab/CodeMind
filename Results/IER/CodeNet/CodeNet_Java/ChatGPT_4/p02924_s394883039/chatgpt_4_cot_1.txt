<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `solve` method that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n-1. The `solve` method is called from the `main` method, which sets up the input and output streams.

The `solve` method reads a single long integer `n` from the input using the `ni()` method, which reads an integer from the input buffer. In this case, the input is `2`.

The calculation performed in `solve` is `(n-1)*n/2`, which is the formula for the sum of the first n-1 natural numbers. For the input `2`, the calculation is `(2-1)*2/2`, which simplifies to `1*2/2`, resulting in `1`.

The result of the calculation is then printed to the output using `out.println(ans)`.

Therefore, the output of the code execution given the input `2` will be `1`.
