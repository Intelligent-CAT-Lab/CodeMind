<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 54 according to the input. The variable x is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop that continues to execute as long as N is greater than or equal to x.
Inside the while loop, x is multiplied by 2 in each iteration.
The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: x = 1 * 2 = 2
- Second iteration: x = 2 * 2 = 4
- Third iteration: x = 4 * 2 = 8
- Fourth iteration: x = 8 * 2 = 16
- Fifth iteration: x = 16 * 2 = 32
- Sixth iteration: x = 32 * 2 = 64

At this point, N (54) is no longer greater than or equal to x (64), so the loop terminates.
The program then prints the value of x divided by 2, which is 64 / 2 = 32.
<<<Output>>>
32
