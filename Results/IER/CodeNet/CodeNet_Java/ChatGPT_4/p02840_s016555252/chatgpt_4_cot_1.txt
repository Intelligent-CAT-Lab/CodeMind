The input values are N = 3, X = 4, and D = 2. The `solve` method is called with these values.

1. Since D is positive and not zero, the code skips the first two conditional blocks.
2. A HashSet `set` is created to store unique values of `(X * i % D + D) % D` for i from 1 to N (inclusive).
3. The loop runs for i = 1 to 3, and the following calculations are made:
   - For i = 1: `(4 * 1 % 2 + 2) % 2 = (4 % 2 + 2) % 2 = (0 + 2) % 2 = 2 % 2 = 0`
   - For i = 2: `(4 * 2 % 2 + 2) % 2 = (8 % 2 + 2) % 2 = (0 + 2) % 2 = 2 % 2 = 0`
   - For i = 3: `(4 * 3 % 2 + 2) % 2 = (12 % 2 + 2) % 2 = (0 + 2) % 2 = 2 % 2 = 0`
   All these calculations result in 0, so only one unique value (0) is added to the set.
4. The set now contains one element: {0}.
5. An array `id` is created with the size of the set, which is 1, and the value 0 is stored in `id[0]`.
6. A PriorityQueue array `pq` is created with one element since the set size is 1.
7. The loop runs again for i = 1 to 3 to calculate the start and end values and add them to the priority queue:
   - For i = 1: start = 0, end = 3 * 1 - 1 * (1 + 1) / 2 = 3 - 1 = 2
   - For i = 2: start = 1, end = 3 * 2 - 2 * (2 + 1) / 2 = 6 - 3 = 3
   - For i = 3: start = 3, end = 3 * 3 - 3 * (3 + 1) / 2 = 9 - 6 = 3
   These values are multiplied by D and added to X * i, then added to the priority queue.
8. The priority queue for index 0 will have the following intervals after adding (start * D + X * i, end * D + X * i):
   - For i = 1: (0 * 2 + 4 * 1, 2 * 2 + 4 * 1) = (4, 8)
   - For i = 2: (1 * 2 + 4 * 2, 3 * 2 + 4 * 2) = (10, 14)
   - For i = 3: (3 * 2 + 4 * 3, 3 * 2 + 4 * 3) = (18, 18)
9. The priority queue is processed to merge overlapping intervals and count the number of distinct values.
10. The intervals are merged as follows:
    - (4, 8) is polled and since there is no overlap with the next interval, it is counted.
    - (10, 14) is polled and since there is no overlap with the next interval, it is counted.
    - (18, 18) is polled and since there is no other interval, it is counted.
11. The number of distinct values is calculated by adding the length of each interval divided by D:
    - For (4, 8): (8 - 4 + 2) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3
    - For (10, 14): (14 - 10 + 2) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3
    - For (18, 18): (18 - 18 + 2) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
12. The sum of distinct values is 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.

Therefore, the output of the code execution is 7.
