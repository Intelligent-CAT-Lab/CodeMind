<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3 2 1`, which corresponds to `n=3`, `m=2`, and `k=1`.

The program calculates the number of ways to arrange `n` balls in `m` boxes such that no box is empty and at most `k` boxes contain more than one ball. It uses modular arithmetic with a modulus of `mod=998244353`.

The `fact` array is used to store factorial values modulo `mod`, and the `ifact` array is used to store modular inverses of the factorial values.

The program initializes `fact[0]`, `fact[1]`, `ifact[0]`, and `ifact[1]` to `1`. Then, it calculates the factorial values for `i` from `2` to `n` and their modular inverses.

The main calculation is done in the loop from `i = 0` to `k`. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of the number of ways to arrange the balls with exactly `i` boxes containing more than one ball.

For `i = 0`, the calculation is as follows:
- `modPow(m-1, n-(i+1), mod)` calculates `(m-1)^(n-(i+1))` modulo `mod`, which is `(2-1)^(3-(0+1)) = 1^2 = 1`.
- `NcR(n-1, i)` calculates the binomial coefficient `(n-1) choose i`, which is `2 choose 0 = 1`.
- The result is multiplied by `m`, which is `2`, and then added to `ans`.

For `i = 1`, the calculation is as follows:
- `modPow(m-1, n-(i+1), mod)` calculates `(m-1)^(n-(i+1))` modulo `mod`, which is `(2-1)^(3-(1+1)) = 1^1 = 1`.
- `NcR(n-1, i)` calculates the binomial coefficient `(n-1) choose i`, which is `2 choose 1 = 2`.
- The result is multiplied by `m`, which is `2`, and then added to `ans`.

Therefore, `ans` is the sum of the following terms:
- For `i = 0`: `2 * 1 * 1 = 2`
- For `i = 1`: `2 * 1 * 2 = 4`

The final answer is `ans = 2 + 4 = 6`.

Finally, the program prints the value of `ans` modulo `mod`.
