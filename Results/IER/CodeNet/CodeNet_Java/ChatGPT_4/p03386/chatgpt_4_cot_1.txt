<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and k are initialized with 3, 8, and 2 respectively according to the input. A TreeSet named set is created to store integers in a sorted order without duplicates.

The first for loop starts with i equal to a (3) and increments i until it reaches b (8). The loop will break early if cnt reaches k (2). In each iteration, cnt is incremented and the current value of i is added to the set. Since k is 2, only the first two numbers in the range from a to b will be added to the set, which are 3 and 4.

The second for loop starts with i equal to b (8) and decrements i until it reaches a (3). Similar to the first loop, it will break early if cnt reaches k (2). In each iteration, cnt is incremented and the current value of i is added to the set. Since k is 2, only the last two numbers in the range from b to a will be added to the set, which are 8 and 7.

The TreeSet will automatically sort the numbers and remove any duplicates. The numbers added to the set are 3, 4, 7, and 8. When the set is iterated over and printed, the numbers will be printed in ascending order.

Therefore, the output will be the numbers 3, 4, 7, and 8 printed on separate lines in ascending order.
