<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `solve` method that determines the output based on the input string `s`. The `main` method sets up the input stream and output writer, calls the `solve` method, and then flushes the output.

The `solve` method reads a string `s` and calculates its length `l`. It then uses a bitwise XOR operator `^` to determine if the length of the string is even and if the first and last characters of the string are different. If either the length is even and the first and last characters are the same, or the length is odd and the first and last characters are different, it prints "Second". Otherwise, it prints "First".

Given the input `aba`, the length of the string `l` is 3, which is odd. The first and last characters of the string are the same ('a'). Since the length is odd and the first and last characters are the same, the condition `l % 2 == 0 ^ s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(l - 1)` evaluates to false, and the `else` block is executed, printing "First".
