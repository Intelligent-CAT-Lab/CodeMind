<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers A and B from the input, which are 9 and 12 respectively. It then calculates the sum of A and B, which is 21. The ternary operator checks if the sum (21) is greater than 23. Since 21 is not greater than 23, the condition is false, and the ternary operator returns the sum itself without any modification. Therefore, the value of ans is 21. The code then prints the value of ans to the console.
<<<Output>>>
21
