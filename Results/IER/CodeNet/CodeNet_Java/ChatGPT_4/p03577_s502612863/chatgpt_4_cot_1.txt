<<<Analysis>>>
The main method initializes an InputReader and an OutputWriter, and then creates an instance of the AXXFESTIVAL class to call its solve method. The solve method reads a string using the InputReader and then prints a substring of that string, excluding the last 8 characters, using the OutputWriter.

The input provided is `CODEFESTIVAL`. The solve method will call `s.substring(0, s.length() - 8)`, which will result in taking the substring from the start of the string to the 4th character from the end (since `CODEFESTIVAL` has 12 characters and 12 - 8 = 4). This will result in the substring `CODE`.

Finally, the OutputWriter will print this substring followed by a newline character.
