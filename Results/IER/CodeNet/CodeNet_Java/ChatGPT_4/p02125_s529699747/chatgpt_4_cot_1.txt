<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized with 2 according to the input.
The for loop starts with i = 0 and will iterate until i is less than 100.
Inside the for loop, there is an if condition that checks if num is greater than or equal to 2^i - 1.
For i = 0, 2^0 - 1 equals 0, and since 2 is greater than 0, the loop continues with the next iteration.
For i = 1, 2^1 - 1 equals 1, and since 2 is greater than 1, the loop continues with the next iteration.
For i = 2, 2^2 - 1 equals 3, and since 2 is not greater than or equal to 3, the else block is executed, and the loop breaks.
The loop breaks when i is 2, and the output is i - 1, which is 1.
