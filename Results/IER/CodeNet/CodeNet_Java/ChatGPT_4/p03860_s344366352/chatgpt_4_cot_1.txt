<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads three strings (a, b, c) from the input, which are "AtCoder", "Beginner", and "Contest" respectively. The code then prints the first character of each of these strings concatenated together. The first character of "AtCoder" is 'A', the first character of "Beginner" is 'B', and the first character of "Contest" is 'C'. Therefore, the output will be the concatenation of 'A', 'B', and 'C', which is "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
