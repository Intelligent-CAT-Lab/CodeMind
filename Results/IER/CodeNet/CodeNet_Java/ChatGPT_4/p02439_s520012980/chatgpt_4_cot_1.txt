<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array of integers with a size of 3. It then enters a for loop to take 3 integer inputs from the user. According to the given input, the array is filled with the integers 4, 5, and 3 respectively.

After the input is taken, the code sorts the array in ascending order using Arrays.sort(). The sorted array will be [3, 4, 5].

Finally, the code prints the first and the last elements of the sorted array, which are the smallest and the largest numbers in the original input. Since the sorted array is [3, 4, 5], the output will be "3 5".
<<<Output>>>
3 5
