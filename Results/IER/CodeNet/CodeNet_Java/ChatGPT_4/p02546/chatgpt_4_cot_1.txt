<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single word from the input using a Scanner object. The input word is stored in the string variable `s`. The input provided is "apple".

The code then checks if the string `s` ends with the character "s" using the `endsWith` method. If it does, it appends "es" to the string `s` and prints the result. If it does not, it appends "s" to the string `s` and prints the result.

Since the input string "apple" does not end with "s", the else block is executed, appending "s" to "apple" and printing the new string "apples".
<<<Output>>>
apples
