The variables N, d1, and x are initialized with 1, 3.0, and 3.0 respectively according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0.0.

The for loop will run only once because N is initialized with 1.

In the first and only iteration of the loop:
- ans is updated to ans + d1 + (N-0.5)*x which is 0.0 + 3.0 + (1-0.5)*3.0 = 3.0 + 0.5*3.0 = 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5
- d1 is updated to ((2*N+2)*d1 + 5*x)/(2*N) which is ((2*1+2)*3.0 + 5*3.0)/(2*1) = (6.0 + 15.0)/2 = 21.0/2 = 10.5
- x is updated to ((double)N+2)/N*x which is ((double)1+2)/1*3.0 = 3.0/1*3.0 = 3.0*3.0 = 9.0

Since N is decremented after each iteration, the loop ends as N becomes 0.

Finally, the program prints the value of ans which is 4.5.

<<<Output>>>
4.5
