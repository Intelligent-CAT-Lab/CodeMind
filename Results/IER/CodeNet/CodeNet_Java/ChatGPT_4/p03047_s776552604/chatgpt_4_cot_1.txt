The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, n and k, from the input. According to the given input, n is assigned the value 3 and k is assigned the value 2. The code then calculates the expression n - k + 1, which is 3 - 2 + 1, and prints the result to the standard output. The result of the expression is 2.
