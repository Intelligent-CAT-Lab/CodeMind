The variables A, B, and K are initialized with 8, 12, and 2 respectively according to the input. An array s with a size of A+B (which is 20) is created to store the common divisors of A and B.

The variables z and y are initialized with 1 and 0 respectively. A while loop is used to find all common divisors of A and B. The loop runs as long as z is less than or equal to both A and B.

Inside the loop, it checks if z is a common divisor of A and B by using the modulo operator. If z is a common divisor (i.e., A%z==0 and B%z==0), it stores z in the array s at index y and increments y by 1. Then, z is incremented by 1 to check the next potential common divisor.

The common divisors of 8 and 12 are 1, 2, and 4. These are stored in the array s at indices 0, 1, and 2 respectively. The value of y after finding all common divisors is 3.

After the loop, the program prints the value of the array s at index y-K, which is s[3-2] = s[1]. Since the common divisors were stored in ascending order, s[1] contains the second largest common divisor, which is 2.
