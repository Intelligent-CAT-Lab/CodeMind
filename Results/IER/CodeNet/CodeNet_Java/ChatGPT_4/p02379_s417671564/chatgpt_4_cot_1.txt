<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four double values from the input, which represent the coordinates of two points in a 2D plane: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). The input provided is `0 0 1 1`, so x1 = 0, y1 = 0, x2 = 1, and y2 = 1.

The code then calculates the distance between these two points using the distance formula: sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). In this case, it calculates sqrt((1 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2), which simplifies to sqrt(1 + 1) or sqrt(2).

Finally, the code prints the result using printf with a format specifier "%.8f", which means it will print the floating-point number with 8 decimal places.

The result of sqrt(2) is approximately 1.41421356 when rounded to 8 decimal places.
