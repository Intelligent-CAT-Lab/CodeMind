The input provided is `5 2`, which initializes `n` with 5 and `K` with 2. The variable `ans` is initialized with 0.

The outer for loop starts with `i = K + 1`, which is 3 in this case, and runs until `i <= n`, which is 5. So, it will iterate for `i` values 3, 4, and 5.

For `i = 3`:
- The inner for loop starts with `j = 0` and runs while `j * i <= n`, which is 5. So, it will iterate for `j` values 0 and 1.
  - For `j = 0`: `i * (j + 1) - 1` is `2`. Since `2 <= n`, `ans` is incremented by `i - K`, which is `1`. Now `ans = 1`.
  - For `j = 1`: `i * (j + 1) - 1` is `5`. Since `5 <= n`, `ans` is incremented by `i - K`, which is `1`. Now `ans = 2`.

For `i = 4`:
- The inner for loop starts with `j = 0` and runs while `j * i <= n`, which is 5. So, it will iterate for `j` value 0 only.
  - For `j = 0`: `i * (j + 1) - 1` is `3`. Since `3 <= n`, `ans` is incremented by `i - K`, which is `2`. Now `ans = 4`.

For `i = 5`:
- The inner for loop starts with `j = 0` and runs while `j * i <= n`, which is 5. So, it will iterate for `j` value 0 only.
  - For `j = 0`: `i * (j + 1) - 1` is `4`. Since `4 <= n`, `ans` is incremented by `i - K`, which is `3`. Now `ans = 7`.

After the outer loop finishes, the condition `if (K == 0)` is checked. Since `K` is not 0, this condition is not executed.

The final value of `ans` is 7, which is printed as the output.
