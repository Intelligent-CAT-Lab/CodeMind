<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object. The input provided is `2 5`, so a is assigned the value 2 and b is assigned the value 5. The code then calculates the product of a and b by multiplying them together, which results in 2 * 5 = 10. Finally, the code prints the result of the multiplication to the standard output using System.out.println().
<<<Output>>>
10
