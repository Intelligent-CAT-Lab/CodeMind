The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads two integers, n and m, which are 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. It also initializes an array x of long integers with a size of 100001 and a constant a with the value 1000000007.

The code checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than 1. Since n and m are both 2, their difference is 0, so the code does not print '0' and does not return early.

Next, the code sets the first element of the array x (x[0]) to 1. It then enters a for loop to calculate the factorial of numbers from 1 to 100000 modulo a and stores the results in the array x. The factorial is calculated iteratively, and each result is stored in the corresponding index of the array x.

After the loop, the code calculates the product of x[n] and x[m] modulo a. Since n and m are both 2, it calculates x[2] * x[2] % a. The value of x[2] is the factorial of 2 modulo a, which is 2 * 1 % a = 2.

The code then checks if n is equal to m. Since they are equal, it multiplies the result by 2 modulo a. So the final answer is (2 * 2) % a * 2 % a = 4 * 2 % a = 8 % a = 8.

Finally, the code prints the result, which is 8, and returns.
