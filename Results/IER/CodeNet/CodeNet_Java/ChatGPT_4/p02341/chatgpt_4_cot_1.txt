<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class that implements `Runnable` and contains the `main` method. The `main` method starts a new thread with a stack size of 16 MB and runs the `run` method of the `Main` class.

The `run` method creates an instance of `FastScanner`, which is a custom scanner class designed to read input from `System.in`. It uses a buffer to read bytes and provides methods to parse those bytes into different data types like `int`, `long`, `String`, etc.

The `FastScanner` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. In this case, the input is `5 10`, so `n` is assigned the value `5` and `k` is assigned the value `10`.

The code then checks if `n` is less than or equal to `k`. Since `5` is less than `10`, the condition is true, and the program prints `1`.

If `n` were greater than `k`, the program would print `0`, but this is not the case with the given input.
