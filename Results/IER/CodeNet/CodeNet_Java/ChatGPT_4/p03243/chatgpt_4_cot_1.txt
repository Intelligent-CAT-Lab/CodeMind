<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 111 according to the input.
The code enters a for loop starting from the value of n (which is 111) and continues until it reaches 1000.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current value of i is divisible by 111 without any remainder.
Since 111 is the first number in the loop and it is divisible by 111 with no remainder (111 % 111 == 0), the condition is immediately met.
The code then prints the current value of i, which is 111, and returns from the main method, ending the program.
<<<Output>>>
111
