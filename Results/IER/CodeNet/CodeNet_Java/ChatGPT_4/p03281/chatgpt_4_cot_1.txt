The variable n is initialized with 105 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The code enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to 105 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it first checks if the current integer i is odd (i % 2 == 1). If i is odd, it initializes a variable divcount to 0 and enters another for loop to count the number of divisors of i.
The inner for loop iterates from 1 to 105 and increments divcount by 1 for each k that divides i without a remainder (i % k == 0).
After the inner loop finishes, it checks if divcount is equal to 8. If it is, it increments ans by 1.
The outer loop continues until all odd numbers from 1 to 105 have been checked.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output, which is the count of odd numbers between 1 and 105 that have exactly 8 divisors.

Let's manually calculate the odd numbers between 1 and 105 that have exactly 8 divisors:
