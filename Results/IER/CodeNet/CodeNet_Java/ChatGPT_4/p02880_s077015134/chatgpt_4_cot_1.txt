<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer `n` from the input, which is `10` in this case. It then checks if `n` matches any of the numbers in a series of OR conditions. These conditions are checking if `n` is equal to any of the numbers from 1 to 9, and then again for multiples of 2 up to 18, multiples of 4 up to 27, multiples of 6 up to 36, multiples of 8 up to 45, multiples of 10 up to 54, multiples of 12 up to 63, multiples of 14 up to 72, and multiples of 16 up to 81.

The number `10` is present in the conditions (n == 10), so the condition will evaluate to true. Therefore, the program will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
