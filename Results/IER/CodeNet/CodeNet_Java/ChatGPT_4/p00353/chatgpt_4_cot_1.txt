<<<Analysis>>>
The input is split into three parts and assigned to variables m, f, and b with values 1000, 3000, and 3000 respectively. The code then checks if b is greater than the sum of m and f, which it is not in this case (3000 is not greater than 4000). Next, it checks if b is greater than m, which it is (3000 is greater than 1000). Since this condition is true, the code executes the statement inside the else if block, which calculates b - m (3000 - 1000) and prints the result. Therefore, the output will be 2000.
