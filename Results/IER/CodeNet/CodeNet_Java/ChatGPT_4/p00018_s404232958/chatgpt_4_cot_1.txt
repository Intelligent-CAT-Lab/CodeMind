<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `nums` of size 5 to store integers. It then enters a loop to read 5 integers from the input and stores them in the array `nums`. The input provided is `3 6 9 7 5`, so the array `nums` will be filled with these values in the order they are given.

After reading the input, the code calls `Arrays.sort(nums)` to sort the array in ascending order. The sorted array will be `[3, 5, 6, 7, 9]`.

Next, the code enters another loop to print the elements of the sorted array in reverse order (i.e., descending order). It checks if the current index `i` is 0, which is the last iteration of the loop, and if so, it prints the last element followed by a newline. Otherwise, it prints the element followed by a space.

The loop starts with `i = nums.length - 1`, which is 4, and decrements `i` in each iteration. The elements are printed in the following order: `9 7 6 5 3`.

9 7 6 5 3
