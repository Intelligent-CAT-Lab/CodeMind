<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "uncopyrightable" is converted to a character array c. The array c is then sorted alphabetically by the Arrays.sort method. The sorted array will look like this: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'e', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'r', 't', 'u', 'y'].

The program then enters a for loop that checks for duplicate characters in the sorted array. It starts from the second character (index 1) and compares it with the previous character (index i-1). If any two consecutive characters are the same, it sets the boolean variable bl to false and breaks out of the loop.

Since the sorted array does not contain any duplicate characters (each character appears only once), the boolean variable bl remains true throughout the loop.

After the loop, the program prints "yes" if bl is true, and "no" if bl is false. In this case, since bl is true, the output will be "yes".
