The variables N and M are initialized with 1 and 6 respectively according to the input. The variable res is initialized with 0.
The if condition checks if N multiplied by 2 is greater than or equal to M. In this case, 1*2 is not greater than or equal to 6, so the else block is executed.
In the else block, the expression (M - 2*N) / 4 is calculated. Substituting the values, we get (6 - 2*1) / 4, which simplifies to (6 - 2) / 4, and then to 4 / 4, which equals 1.
The result of this expression is then added to N, which is 1, so res becomes 1 + 1, which equals 2.
The final value of res, which is 2, is then printed to the console.
