<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate the number of surjections from a set of size `n` onto a set of size `k`. A surjection is a function that covers every element of the target set at least once. The input `4 3` means we want to find the number of surjections from a set of size 4 onto a set of size 3.

The `Combinatrics` class is initialized with `k` which is 3. This initialization creates tables for factorial, inverse, and factorial inverse up to `k+1` which is 4 in this case.

The `surjection` method calculates the number of surjections using the inclusion-exclusion principle. It iterates from 1 to `k` (which is 3), alternating the sign for each term, and calculates the sum of `combination(k, i) * iterationPow(i, n)` for each `i`. The `iterationPow` method calculates `i^n` using the repeated squaring method under modulo `mod`.

Let's calculate the output step by step:

1. For `i = 1`, `combination(3, 1)` is 3, and `iterationPow(1, 4)` is 1. The term is `3 * 1 = 3`.
2. For `i = 2`, `combination(3, 2)` is 3, and `iterationPow(2, 4)` is 16. The term is `-3 * 16 = -48`.
3. For `i = 3`, `combination(3, 3)` is 1, and `iterationPow(3, 4)` is 81. The term is `1 * 81 = 81`.

Adding these up: `3 - 48 + 81 = 36`. Since we are working under modulo `mod = 1000000007`, we don't need to apply the modulo operation as the result is already less than `mod`.

Therefore, the output is 36.
