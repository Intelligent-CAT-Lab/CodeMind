<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable 'l'. Given the input is `3`, the value of 'l' is set to 3.0 (since it is stored as a double).

The next line calculates the cube of one third of 'l' using the Math.pow function. The expression 'l / 3' computes to 1.0 (since 3.0 / 3 is 1.0), and then Math.pow(1.0, 3) computes the cube of 1.0, which is 1.0.

Finally, the result of the Math.pow function, which is 1.0, is printed to the standard output.

The Scanner is then closed to prevent resource leaks.

1.0
