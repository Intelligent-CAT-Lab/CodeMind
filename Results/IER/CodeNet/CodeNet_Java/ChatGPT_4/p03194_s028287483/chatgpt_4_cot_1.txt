<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and p are initialized with 3 and 24 respectively according to the input. The Scanner is then closed as it is no longer needed.

The code checks if n is equal to 1, which it is not, so it skips the if block.

The variable ans is initialized with 1.

The code enters a for loop with i starting from 2 and incrementing by 1 until it reaches a value less than p (24 in this case).

Inside the for loop, the code calculates t as i raised to the power of n (i^n). It then checks if p is divisible by t. If it is, ans is updated to the current value of i.

The loop also has a break condition if t becomes greater than p, to avoid unnecessary calculations.

Let's go through the loop iterations:
- i = 2: t = 2^3 = 8, p % t = 24 % 8 = 0, so ans is updated to 2.
- i = 3: t = 3^3 = 27, since t > p, the loop breaks.

The loop ends and the final value of ans, which is 2, is printed as the output.
