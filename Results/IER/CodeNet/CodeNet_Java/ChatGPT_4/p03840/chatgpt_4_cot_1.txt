<<<Analysis>>>
The input values are assigned to the variables as follows:
- ai = 2
- ao = 1
- at = 1
- aj = 0
- al = 0
- as = 0
- az = 0

The variable ans is initialized with 0 and then the value of ao (which is 1) is added to it.

The code then checks the parity (even or odd) of the values of ai, aj, and al and sums their remainders when divided by 2. Since ai is 2 (even), aj is 0 (even), and al is 0 (even), their remainders when divided by 2 are 0, 0, and 0 respectively. The sum of these remainders is 0.

The condition that checks if the sum of remainders is 3 is not met, so it moves to the next condition.

The condition that checks if the sum of remainders is 2 is not met, so it moves to the next condition.

The condition that checks if the sum of remainders is 1 is not met, so it moves to the next condition.

The condition that checks if the sum of remainders is 0 is met. Since all three values are even, it adds the values of ai, aj, and al to ans. However, since aj and al are 0, only ai (which is 2) is effectively added to ans.

Therefore, the final value of ans is 1 (initial value from ao) + 2 (from ai) = 3.

The out.println(ans) statement will print the value of ans, which is 3.
