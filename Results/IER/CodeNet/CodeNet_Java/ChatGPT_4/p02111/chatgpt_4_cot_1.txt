<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 0 according to the input. The variable minute is calculated as 12 * 60 * n / 360, which simplifies to 12 * 60 * 0 / 360. This results in minute being 0 because any number multiplied by 0 is 0.
The output is then calculated as (minute / 60) and (minute % 60). Since minute is 0, both (minute / 60) and (minute % 60) will be 0.
Therefore, the output will be "0 0", representing 0 hours and 0 minutes.
<<<Output>>>
