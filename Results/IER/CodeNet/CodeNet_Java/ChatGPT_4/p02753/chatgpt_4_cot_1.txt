<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main class `Main` with a `main` method that reads a string `S` from the standard input. It then checks if the first, second, and third characters of the string are the same. If they are, it prints "No", otherwise it prints "Yes".

The `Reader` class is used to facilitate reading from the standard input. It uses a `BufferedReader` and a `StringTokenizer` to read and tokenize the input line.

The `println` method is a helper method that prints an object followed by a newline to the standard output. The `print` method is similar but does not append a newline.

Given the input `ABA`, the program will check if the first (`S.charAt(0)`), second (`S.charAt(1)`), and third (`S.charAt(2)`) characters are the same. Since the characters are 'A', 'B', and 'A' respectively, they are not all the same. Therefore, the condition `S.charAt(0) == S.charAt(1) && S.charAt(1) == S.charAt(2)` is false, and the program will print "Yes".

Finally, the `Reader` and `PrintWriter` objects are closed using the `close` method.
