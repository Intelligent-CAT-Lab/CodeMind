<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers n, a, and b from the input, which are initialized with 5, 2, and 4 respectively. It then checks if the difference between b and a is even by calculating (b - a) % 2 and comparing it to 0. If the result is 0, it means the difference is even, and it prints "Alice". Otherwise, it prints "Borys".

In this case, the difference between b (4) and a (2) is 2, which is even. Therefore, the condition (b - a) % 2 == 0 is true.

<<<Output>>>
Alice
