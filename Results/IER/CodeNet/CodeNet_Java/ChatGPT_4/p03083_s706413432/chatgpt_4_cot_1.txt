The input `2 1` initializes the variables `a` and `b` with the values 2 and 1, respectively. The `precalc` method is called to initialize the `fact`, `inv`, and `invFact` arrays used for calculating combinations and modular inverses.

The `solve` method then initializes an array `ans` of size `a + b` (which is 3 in this case) to store the final answers. It also initializes `aEnded` and `bEnded` to keep track of the probabilities that a sequence ends with `a` or `b`, respectively.

The first element of `ans` is set to `inv(2)` which is the modular inverse of 2 under the modulus `MOD`. Since `inv[2]` is precalculated in the `precalc` method, `inv(2)` will return `inv[2]` which is `500000004` (since `MOD` is `1e9 + 7`).

The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i = a + b - 1` (which is 2 in this case). Inside the loop, it calculates `aEndsHere` and `bEndsHere` which are the probabilities that a sequence of length `i` ends with `a` or `b`, respectively. These are calculated using the combination function `C` and the `inv` function to find the modular inverse of `2^i`.

After calculating `aEndsHere` and `bEndsHere`, the loop updates `aEnded` and `bEnded` with these values. Then it calculates the probability that the sequence does not end with `a` or `b` and adds half of this probability to `ans[i]` (since we are considering a fair coin).

The `if` statement after the calculation ensures that if `ans[i]` is negative, it is brought back to the positive range by adding `MOD`.

Finally, the loop prints out each element of `ans`.

Let's calculate the values for `ans`:
- `ans[0] = inv(2) = 500000004`
- For `i = 1`:
  - `aEndsHere = C(0, 1) * inv(2) = 0 * inv(2) = 0`
  - `bEndsHere = C(0, 0) * inv(2) = 1 * inv(2) = 500000004`
  - `aEnded = 0 + 0 = 0`
  - `bEnded = 0 + 500000004 = 500000004`
  - `ans[1] = bEnded + (1 - aEnded - bEnded) * inv(2) = 500000004 + (1 - 0 - 500000004) * 500000004 = 500000004 + 500000004 * 500000004 = 750000006`
- For `i = 2`:
  - `aEndsHere = C(1, 1) * inv(4) = 1 * inv(4) = 250000002`
  - `bEndsHere = C(1, 0) * inv(4) = 1 * inv(4) = 250000002`
  - `aEnded = 0 + 250000002 = 250000002`
  - `bEnded = 500000004 + 250000002 = 750000006`
  - `ans[2] = bEnded + (1 - aEnded - bEnded) * inv(2) = 750000006 + (1 - 250000002 - 750000006) * 500000004 = 750000006 + 250000002 * 500000004 = 875000005`

The output will be the elements of `ans` array, which are `500000004`, `750000006`, and `875000005`.
