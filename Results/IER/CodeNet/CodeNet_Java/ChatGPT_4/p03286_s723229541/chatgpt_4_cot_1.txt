<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to convert a decimal number into its equivalent in base -2. The input `-9` is read and stored in the variable `n`. The `StringBuilder` object `sb` is used to build the base -2 representation of the number.

The code checks if `n` is 0, in which case it would print `0` and return. Since `n` is `-9`, it skips this check and enters the while loop.

The while loop continues until `n` becomes 0. Inside the loop, the code checks the remainder of `n` when divided by `-2`. If the remainder is 0, it appends "0" to `sb` and divides `n` by `-2`. If the remainder is not 0 (which means it is 1, since we are dealing with integers), it appends "1" to `sb`. If `n` is negative, it increments `n` after dividing by `-2` to handle the negative base conversion correctly.

Let's go through the steps for `-9`:
1. `-9 % -2` is 1 (since -10 is the next multiple of -2), so "1" is appended to `sb`, and `n` becomes `(-9 / -2) + 1 = 5`.
2. `5 % -2` is 1, so "1" is appended to `sb`, and `n` becomes `(5 / -2) = -2`.
3. `-2 % -2` is 0, so "0" is appended to `sb`, and `n` becomes `(-2 / -2) = 1`.
4. `1 % -2` is 1, so "1" is appended to `sb`, and `n` becomes `(1 / -2) = 0` (since we are dealing with integer division).

The loop ends, and the `StringBuilder` contains the string "1101" in reverse order. The `reverse()` method is called on `sb` to reverse the string, resulting in "1011".

Finally, the code prints out the string "1011", which is the base -2 representation of `-9`.
