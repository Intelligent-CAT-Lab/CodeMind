The input is a single number `3`. The `solve` method of the `Task` class is called with this input. The `solve` method calls the `func` method with parameters `N` and `N`, both set to `3`.

The `func` method is a recursive method that calculates a value based on the input parameters `S` and `X`. It uses a `TreeMap` called `dp` to memoize the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the recursive calls:

1. `func(3, 3)` is called.
2. Since `S` is not `0`, it checks if there is a `TreeMap` for `S = 3` in `dp`. There isn't, so it creates one.
3. It then calls `func(3 / 2, 3 / 2)` which is `func(1, 1)`.
4. In `func(1, 1)`, since `S` is not `0`, it checks if there is a `TreeMap` for `S = 1` in `dp`. There isn't, so it creates one.
5. It then calls `func(1 / 2, 1 / 2)` which is `func(0, 0)`.
6. `func(0, 0)` returns `1` because `S` is `0`.
7. It then calls `func((1 - 1) / 2, (1 - 1) / 2)` which is `func(0, 0)` and gets `1`.
8. Since `S` is not greater than or equal to `2`, it doesn't call `func((S - 2) / 2, X / 2)`.
9. The result for `func(1, 1)` is `(1 + 1) % MOD` which is `2`.
10. It then calls `func((3 - 1) / 2, (3 - 1) / 2)` which is `func(1, 1)` and gets `2`.
11. It then calls `func((3 - 2) / 2, 3 / 2)` which is `func(0, 1)`.
12. `func(0, 1)` returns `1` because `S` is `0`.
13. The result for `func(3, 3)` is `(2 + 2 + 1) % MOD` which is `5`.

The final result of `func(3, 3)` is `5`, and this is what the `solve` method prints out.
