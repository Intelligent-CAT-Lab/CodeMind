<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to read three integers from the input, calculate their square roots with a precision of 50 decimal places, and then check if the sum of the square roots of the first two numbers is less than the square root of the third number.

Here are the steps the code follows with the given input `2 3 9`:

1. The Scanner object `sc` is created to read from the standard input.
2. The square root of the first input number (2) is calculated with a precision of 50 decimal places using the `sqrt` method. The initial approximation of the square root is obtained using `Math.sqrt(a.doubleValue())`, which is then refined in the loop.
3. The square root of the second input number (3) is calculated in the same way.
4. The square root of the third input number (9) is calculated, which should be exactly 3 with no need for the approximation loop since 9 is a perfect square.
5. The BigDecimal objects `a` and `b` representing the square roots of 2 and 3 are added together, and the result is compared to the BigDecimal object `c` representing the square root of 9 using the `compareTo` method.
6. If the sum of `a` and `b` is less than `c`, the output will be "Yes". Otherwise, the output will be "No".
7. The Scanner object `sc` is closed.

Let's calculate the square roots:
- sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414213562373095 (and more digits)
- sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732050807568877 (and more digits)
- sqrt(9) is exactly 3.

The sum of sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) is approximately 3.146264369941972 (and more digits), which is greater than 3. Therefore, the condition `a.add(b).compareTo(c)==-1` will not be satisfied.
