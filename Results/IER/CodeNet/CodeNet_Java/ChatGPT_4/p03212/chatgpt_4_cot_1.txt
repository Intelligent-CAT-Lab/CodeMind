<<<Analysis>>>
The input N is initialized with 575. The program initializes a HashSet named set, a Queue named queue, and a count variable set to 0. It also defines an array of characters ch containing '3', '5', and '7'.

The queue is pre-populated with permutations of "357" which are "357", "375", "537", "573", "735", and "753".

The program checks if N is less than 1000, which it is in this case since N is 575. It then iterates over the queue and checks if the long value of each string in the queue is less than or equal to N. If it is, it increments the count.

The strings "357", "375", "537", and "573" are all less than or equal to 575, so the count is incremented by 4.

Since N is less than 1000, the program does not proceed to the while loop and prints the count, which is 4.
