<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is initialized with "SENW". The variable ans is initialized with "No".
The program checks if the string S contains "N", "S", "E", and "W" using the contains method. Since the input string "SENW" contains all four characters, the first if condition is satisfied, and ans is set to "Yes".
The subsequent if conditions are not checked because the first condition has already been satisfied and the ans variable has been updated.
Finally, the program prints the value of ans, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
