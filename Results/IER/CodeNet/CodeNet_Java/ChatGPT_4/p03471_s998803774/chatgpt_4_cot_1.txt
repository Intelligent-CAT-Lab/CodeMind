<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to solve a problem where it tries to find the combination of three different types of bills (10000 yen, 5000 yen, and 1000 yen) that sum up to a certain amount (y) given a total number of bills (n). The input provided is `9 45000`, which means we have 9 bills in total that should sum up to 45000 yen.

The `TaskC` class has a `solve` method that takes the number of bills (n) and the total amount (y) as inputs. It then uses two nested for loops to iterate through all possible combinations of the 10000 yen and 5000 yen bills (denoted by i and j, respectively). The remaining number of bills is calculated as `n - i - j`, and these are assumed to be 1000 yen bills.

For each combination, the code calculates the total amount as `10000L * i + 5000L * j + 1000L * (n - i - j)`. If this amount equals the input amount y, it prints out the combination of bills and returns, ending the method execution.

If no combination is found that sums up to the input amount y, the code prints out "-1 -1 -1".

Let's analyze the input `9 45000`:
- The first combination that will satisfy the condition `10000L * i + 5000L * j + 1000L * (n - i - j) == y` is when i = 4, j = 0. This is because `10000L * 4 + 5000L * 0 + 1000L * (9 - 4 - 0)` equals `40000 + 0 + 5000`, which is 45000.
- The code will then print "4 0 5" and return.

Therefore, the output will be "4 0 5".
