<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 2^4 - 1 (which is 15), inclusive. For each iteration, it assigns the current loop index i to the variable temp and prints the value of i followed by a colon.

Inside the nested for loop, it checks if the least significant bit of temp is 1 (meaning if temp % 2 equals 1). If it is, it prints the value of j, which represents the position of the bit that is set to 1. After each iteration, temp is divided by 2 (right-shifted by one bit).

The output will be a list of numbers from 0 to 15, each followed by a colon and the positions of the bits that are set to 1 in their binary representation.

Let's go through the first few iterations to illustrate:
- For i = 0, binary is 0000, so no positions are printed.
- For i = 1, binary is 0001, so position 0 is printed.
- For i = 2, binary is 0010, so position 1 is printed.
- For i = 3, binary is 0011, so positions 0 and 1 are printed.
- ...
- This continues until i = 15, binary is 1111, so positions 0, 1, 2, and 3 are printed.
