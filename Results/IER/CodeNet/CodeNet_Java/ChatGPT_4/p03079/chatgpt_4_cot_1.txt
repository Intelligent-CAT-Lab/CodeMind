<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `main` method that creates an instance of `Main` and calls its `solve` method. The `solve` method creates an instance of the nested class `FastScanner` to read input from the standard input stream.

The `FastScanner` class is designed to tokenize input lines and provide methods to read different types of data, such as `nextInt` for integers.

In the `solve` method, three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` are read using the `nextInt` method of the `FastScanner` instance.

The code then checks if all three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal. If they are, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Given the input `2 2 2`, the code will read these three integers, find that they are all equal, and therefore print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
