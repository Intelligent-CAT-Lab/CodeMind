<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main method that reads a line of input and splits it into three parts, which are then converted into integers a, b, and c. The input provided is "1 3 8".

The integers are assigned as follows:
- a = 1
- b = 3
- c = 8

The code then checks if a is less than b and b is less than c. Since 1 is less than 3 and 3 is less than 8, the condition (a < b && b < c) is true.

Therefore, the code will print "Yes" to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
