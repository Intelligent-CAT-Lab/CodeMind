The variables K, A, and B are initialized with 4000, 2000, and 500 respectively according to the input.

The first if condition checks if A is greater than or equal to K. Since A (2000) is not greater than or equal to K (4000), it moves to the next condition.

The second if condition checks if A is less than or equal to B. Since A (2000) is greater than B (500), it moves to the next condition.

The third if condition checks if the remainder of (K - A) divided by (A - B) is 0. The calculation is as follows:
(K - A) = 4000 - 2000 = 2000
(A - B) = 2000 - 500 = 1500
The remainder of 2000 divided by 1500 is not 0, so it moves to the else block.

The else block calculates the output as follows:
((K - A) / (A - B)) * 2 + 3
= ((4000 - 2000) / (2000 - 500)) * 2 + 3
= (2000 / 1500) * 2 + 3
= 1 * 2 + 3 (since integer division truncates the decimal part)
= 2 + 3
= 5

Therefore, the output of the code will be 5.
