<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main method and a helper method sumDigits. The main method reads an integer n from the input, which is 12 in this case. It then calls the sumDigits method with n as the argument to calculate the sum of its digits.

The sumDigits method initializes a sum variable to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as n is not 0. Inside the loop, it adds the rightmost digit of n to sum (n % 10) and then removes the rightmost digit from n (n /= 10). For the input 12, the sum of digits would be calculated as follows:
- First iteration: sum = 0 + (12 % 10) = 2, n = 12 / 10 = 1
- Second iteration: sum = 2 + (1 % 10) = 3, n = 1 / 10 = 0
The loop ends because n is now 0.

The sumDigits method returns the sum, which is 3. Back in the main method, it checks if the original number n (12) is divisible by the sum of its digits (3). Since 12 is divisible by 3, the condition (n % a == 0) is true, and the program prints "Yes".
