<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input. Variables odd and notOdd are initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to 4. For each iteration, it checks if the current integer i is even (i % 2 == 0). If it is even, it increments notOdd; otherwise, it increments odd.
The loop runs four times with i taking the values 1, 2, 3, and 4. When i is 1 and 3, odd is incremented (since 1 and 3 are odd numbers). When i is 2 and 4, notOdd is incremented (since 2 and 4 are even numbers).
At the end of the loop, odd is 2 and notOdd is 2, because there are two odd numbers (1 and 3) and two even numbers (2 and 4) between 1 and 4.
The program then prints the result of odd / n, which is 2 / 4 = 0.5.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
