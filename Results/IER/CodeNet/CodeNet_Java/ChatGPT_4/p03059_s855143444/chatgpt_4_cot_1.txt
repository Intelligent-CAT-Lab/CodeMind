<<<Analysis>>>
The input `3 5 7` initializes the variables a, b, and t with the values 3, 5, and 7 respectively. The method `solve_abc125_a()` is called, which uses these values to calculate the output.

The calculation is as follows:
- It calculates the number of times the event occurs within the time t by dividing t by a (7 / 3), which results in 2 when cast to an integer because integer division truncates the decimal part.
- It then multiplies this number by b to get the total number of biscuits (2 * 5), which equals 10.

The output is the total number of biscuits, which is 10 in this case.

<<<Output>>>
10
