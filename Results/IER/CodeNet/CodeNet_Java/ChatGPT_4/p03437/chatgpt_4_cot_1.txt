<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two long variables x and y with the values 8 and 6 respectively according to the input. It then checks if x is divisible by y using the modulo operator. Since 8 % 6 is not equal to 0, the condition x % y == 0 is false. Therefore, the else block is executed, and the value of x, which is 8, is printed as the output.
<<<Output>>>
8
