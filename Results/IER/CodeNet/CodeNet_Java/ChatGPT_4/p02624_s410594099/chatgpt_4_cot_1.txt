The input provided is `4`. The main method reads this input and initializes `n` with the value `4`. Then, it initializes the array `arr` with a size of `n+1`, which is `5` in this case.

The `compute` method is called to fill the array `arr`. Initially, all elements of `arr` are filled with `1`. Then, a nested loop is used to count the number of divisors for each number from `2` to `n` (inclusive). For each `i` from `2` to `arr.length/2` (which is `2` in this case), it increments the count of divisors for multiples of `i` by iterating through the array and incrementing `arr[j]` for each multiple `j` of `i`. After this loop, for the remaining elements from `i` to `arr.length` (which are `3` and `4` in this case), it increments their divisor count by `1`.

After the `compute` method is finished, the array `arr` will have the following values:
- `arr[0]` is not used.
- `arr[1]` will be `1` (1 has one divisor: itself).
- `arr[2]` will be `2` (2 has two divisors: 1 and itself).
- `arr[3]` will be `2` (3 has two divisors: 1 and itself).
- `arr[4]` will be `3` (4 has three divisors: 1, 2, and itself).

Next, the main method calculates the sum `ans` by iterating from `1` to `n` (inclusive) and adding the product of `i` and `arr[i]` to `ans`. The calculation will be as follows:
- For `i = 1`: `ans += 1 * arr[1]` which is `1`.
- For `i = 2`: `ans += 2 * arr[2]` which is `4`.
- For `i = 3`: `ans += 3 * arr[3]` which is `6`.
- For `i = 4`: `ans += 4 * arr[4]` which is `12`.

The final value of `ans` will be the sum of the above, which is `1 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 23`.

Finally, the program prints the value of `ans` and flushes the output.
