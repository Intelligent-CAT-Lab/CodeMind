<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "BBBWW". The length of `s` is 5, so the `str` array is also initialized with a length of 5. The `counter` variable is initialized with 0.

The first for loop iterates over the length of the string `s` and fills the `str` array with individual characters of the string `s`. After this loop, `str` will contain ["B", "B", "B", "W", "W"].

The second for loop iterates from 0 to 3 (since `str.length - 1` is 4) and compares each character with the next one. If they are not equal, `counter` is incremented by 1.

- `str[0]` equals `str[1]` ("B" == "B"), so `counter` remains 0.
- `str[1]` equals `str[2]` ("B" == "B"), so `counter` remains 0.
- `str[2]` does not equal `str[3]` ("B" != "W"), so `counter` is incremented to 1.
- `str[3]` equals `str[4]` ("W" == "W"), so `counter` remains 1.

Finally, the program prints the value of `counter`, which is 1.
