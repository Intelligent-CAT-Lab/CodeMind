<<<Analysis>>>
The input `3 1` sets N to 3 and K to 1. The code is designed to calculate some form of combinatorial value based on these inputs.

The memo array is initialized to -1 for all values. This array is used for memoization to store intermediate results of the recursive function `rec`.

The `rec` function is a recursive function that calculates some value based on the parameters x, y, and p. The base cases are when x >= N or y < 0. The recursive calls depend on the values of x, y, and p, and the function is used to fill the `tmp` array with values for each possible y up to a certain limit.

The `dp` array is used to store dynamic programming values. Initially, dp[0] is set to 1, and the rest are implicitly initialized to 0. The `tmp` array is used to store temporary values for the current iteration.

The main loop iterates M times, where M is the minimum of 2*K and N. In each iteration, it calculates a value y based on the current index i, N, and K. It then calculates the sum of all y's up to the current point.

The inner loop updates the `dp` array using the values from the `tmp` array and the previous values of `dp`. This loop is essentially performing a convolution of the `tmp` array with the `dp` array.

After the main loop, the code calculates factorials up to N and stores them in the `fact` array.

Finally, the code calculates the answer by alternatingly adding and subtracting the product of the factorial of (N-i) and dp[i], modulo `mod`.

The answer is then printed, ensuring that it is positive by adding `mod` and taking the result modulo `mod` again.

Given the input `3 1`, the code will go through these steps and calculate the final answer based on the described algorithm.
