<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then declares two integer variables, d and c.

The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner object and assigns them to the variables d and c, respectively. According to the given input, d is assigned the value 20 and c is assigned the value 2.

The code then calculates the product of d and c by multiplying them together and prints the result to the standard output. The multiplication of 20 and 2 is 40.

Therefore, the output of the code will be the result of the multiplication, which is 40.
<<<Output>>>
40
