<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `S` is initialized with "aabbaa". A `Stack<String>` named `stack` is created to store strings.

The first character of `S` is taken as `before` and pushed onto the stack. So `before` is "a" and the stack now contains ["a"].

The second character of `S` is taken as `candidate` and compared with `before`. Since `candidate` is also "a", it is concatenated with the third character of `S`, which is "b", resulting in `before` being "ab". This new `before` is pushed onto the stack, so the stack now contains ["a", "ab"].

The variable `start` is set to 3, and `candidate` is set to null.

The for loop starts from index 3 of `S`. The `candidate` is built by concatenating characters until it is different from `before`. The loop processes the remaining characters "baa".

- At index 3, `candidate` is "b". It is different from `before` ("ab"), so it is pushed onto the stack and becomes the new `before`. The stack is now ["a", "ab", "b"].
- At index 4, `candidate` is "a". It is different from `before` ("b"), so it is pushed onto the stack and becomes the new `before`. The stack is now ["a", "ab", "b", "a"].
- At index 5, `candidate` is "a". It is the same as `before` ("a"), so it is concatenated with the next character. However, there are no more characters to process, so the loop ends.

The size of the stack is printed, which is 4.
