<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables SideA, SideB, and SideC.

An integer array arr is created with the values of SideA, SideB, and SideC. The Arrays.sort() method is called to sort the array in ascending order.

After sorting, the code checks if the first element of the array is 5, the second element is 5, and the third element is 7. If this condition is true, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the input `5 5 7`, the array after sorting will still be [5, 5, 7] because the input is already in ascending order. Therefore, the condition (arr[0] == 5 && arr[1] == 5 && arr[2] == 7) will be true.

As a result, the code will print "YES".
