<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `90`, which is assigned to the variable `x`. The variable `deg` is initialized with `360`, and `ans` is initialized with `0`.

The code enters a while loop that continues until `deg % x` equals `0`. In each iteration of the loop, the following steps occur:

1. `ans` is incremented by `deg / x`. Since `deg` is `360` and `x` is `90`, `deg / x` is `4`. So `ans` becomes `4` in the first iteration.
2. `deg` is updated to `360 + deg % x`. Since `deg % x` is `0` (`360 % 90`), `deg` remains `360`.
3. The loop condition is checked again. Since `deg % x` is `0`, the loop terminates.

After the loop, `ans` is incremented one more time by `deg / x`, which is `4`. However, since the loop has already terminated due to `deg % x` being `0`, this step is redundant and does not change the outcome.

The final value of `ans` is `4`, which is then printed out.
