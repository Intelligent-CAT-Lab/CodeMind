<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is initialized with "ASSA". A HashMap m is created to store characters and their frequencies.
The for loop iterates over each character in the string "ASSA".
- The first character 'A' is not in the map, so it is added with a frequency of 1.
- The second character 'S' is not in the map, so it is added with a frequency of 1.
- The third character 'S' is already in the map, so its frequency is incremented to 2.
- The fourth character 'A' is already in the map, so its frequency is incremented to 2.

After the loop, the map contains 2 keys ('A' and 'S') with their respective frequencies (2 for 'A' and 2 for 'S').
Since the size of the map is 2, which means there are exactly 2 distinct characters in the string, the condition m.size() == 2 is true.
Therefore, the program prints "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
