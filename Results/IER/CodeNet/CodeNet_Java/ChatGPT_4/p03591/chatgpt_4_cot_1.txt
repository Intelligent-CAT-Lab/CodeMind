<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "YAKINIKU" is read and stored in the variable s. The length of the string is checked to be less than 4, but since "YAKINIKU" has a length of 8, the condition is false and the program does not print "No" or return early.

Next, the program creates a substring of the first 4 characters of the input string, which is "YAKI", and stores it in the variable s2. It then checks if s2 is equal to the string "YAKI". Since s2 is indeed "YAKI", the condition is true.

Therefore, the program prints "Yes" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
