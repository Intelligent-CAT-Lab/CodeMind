<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer from the input using a Scanner object. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as there is an integer to read from the input. Inside the loop, it reads the integer N, which is 5700 according to the input.

The code then calculates `N - (N % 500)`. For the input 5700, the modulo operation `5700 % 500` gives 200, because 5700 divided by 500 is 11 with a remainder of 200. The code then subtracts this remainder from N, resulting in `5700 - 200`, which equals 5500.

The result of this calculation, 5500, is then printed to the console.

Since there is no additional input provided, the while loop will terminate after processing the single input of 5700.

<<<Output>>>
5500
