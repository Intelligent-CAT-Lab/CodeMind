<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a new Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, A and B, from the input using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object. The input provided is `2 5`, so A is assigned the value 2 and B is assigned the value 5. The code then calculates the product of A and B by multiplying them together, which results in 2 * 5 = 10. Finally, the code prints the result of the multiplication to the standard output using System.out.println(). Therefore, the output will be the product of the two input numbers, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
