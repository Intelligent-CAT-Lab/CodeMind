The input string is "A??C". The length of the string is 4. The 2D array `d` is initialized with dimensions [5][4], and `d[0][0]` is set to 1.

The for loop iterates over the characters of the string, and for each character, it calculates the values for `d[i][0]`, `d[i][1]`, `d[i][2]`, and `d[i][3]` based on the character at the current position and the values from the previous position.

1. For the first character 'A':
   - `n` is set to 1 because the character is not a '?'.
   - `a` is set to 1 because the character is 'A'.
   - `b` and `c` are set to 0 because the character is not 'B' or 'C'.
   - `d[1][0]` is calculated as `d[0][0] * n % N` which is `1 * 1 % 1_000_000_007` = 1.
   - `d[1][1]` is calculated as `d[0][1] * n % N + a * d[0][0]` which is `0 * 1 % 1_000_000_007 + 1 * 1` = 1.
   - `d[1][2]` and `d[1][3]` remain 0 because `b` and `c` are 0.

2. For the second character '?':
   - `n` is set to 3 because the character is '?'.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are set to 1 because the character is '?'.
   - `d[2][0]` is calculated as `d[1][0] * n % N` which is `1 * 3 % 1_000_000_007` = 3.
   - `d[2][1]` is calculated as `d[1][1] * n % N + a * d[1][0]` which is `1 * 3 % 1_000_000_007 + 1 * 1` = 4.
   - `d[2][2]` is calculated as `d[1][2] * n % N + b * d[1][1]` which is `0 * 3 % 1_000_000_007 + 1 * 1` = 1.
   - `d[2][3]` remains 0 because `c` is 1 but `d[1][2]` is 0.

3. For the third character '?':
   - `n` is set to 3 again.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are set to 1 again.
   - `d[3][0]` is calculated as `d[2][0] * n % N` which is `3 * 3 % 1_000_000_007` = 9.
   - `d[3][1]` is calculated as `d[2][1] * n % N + a * d[2][0]` which is `4 * 3 % 1_000_000_007 + 1 * 3` = 15.
   - `d[3][2]` is calculated as `d[2][2] * n % N + b * d[2][1]` which is `1 * 3 % 1_000_000_007 + 1 * 4` = 7.
   - `d[3][3]` is calculated as `d[2][3] * n % N + c * d[2][2]` which is `0 * 3 % 1_000_000_007 + 1 * 1` = 1.

4. For the fourth character 'C':
   - `n` is set to 1.
   - `c` is set to 1 because the character is 'C'.
   - `a` and `b` are set to 0 because the character is not 'A' or 'B'.
   - `d[4][0]` is calculated as `d[3][0] * n % N` which is `9 * 1 % 1_000_000_007` = 9.
   - `d[4][1]` is calculated as `d[3][1] * n % N + a * d[3][0]` which is `15 * 1 %
