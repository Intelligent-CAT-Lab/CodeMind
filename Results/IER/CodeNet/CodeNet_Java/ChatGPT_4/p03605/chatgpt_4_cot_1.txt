<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `29`. The code reads this input and assigns it to the variable `N`. It then calculates the remainder (`amari`) of `N` when divided by 10, which is `9`, and the quotient (`sho`) when `N` is divided by 10, which is `2`.

The code then checks if either `amari` or `sho` is equal to `9`. In this case, `amari` is `9`, so the first condition is true. Therefore, the code will print "Yes" and will not check the second condition.

The rest of the code defines some utility functions, but these are not used in the main method for the given input.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
