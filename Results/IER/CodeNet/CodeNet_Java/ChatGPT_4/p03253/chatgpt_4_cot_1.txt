<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `2 6`, so `n` is initialized to 2 and `m` to 6. The variable `res` is also set to 6, and `ans` is initialized to 1.

The code enters a for loop with `i` starting at 2 and continues as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `res`. The loop will check for prime factors of `res` and calculate the number of combinations for each prime factor's power plus `n - 1` choose `n - 1`.

For `i = 2`, `res % i` is 0, so `cnt` is incremented to 1 and `res` is divided by `i` to become 3. The loop continues until `res % i` is not 0, which happens immediately after since `res` is now 3.

`ans` is multiplied by `calcComb(cnt + n - 1, n - 1)`, which is `calcComb(1 + 2 - 1, 2 - 1)` or `calcComb(2, 1)`. The `calcComb` function calculates the combination of `n` choose `k` using the formula `(n! / (k! * (n - k)!)) % MOD`. In this case, it calculates `2! / (1! * 1!) % MOD`, which is `2`.

`ans` is now `1 * 2 % MOD`, which is `2`.

The loop ends because `i * i` is no longer less than or equal to `res`.

Since `res` is not 1, the code multiplies `ans` by `calcComb(n, 1)`, which is `calcComb(2, 1)`. This is the same calculation as before, so `ans` is multiplied by `2` again.

`ans` is now `2 * 2 % MOD`, which is `4`.

The final value of `ans` is printed, which is `4`.
