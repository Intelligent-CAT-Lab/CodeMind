<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "atcoder beginner contest" is read and split into an array of strings ["atcoder", "beginner", "contest"] based on spaces.
A StringBuilder object `sb` is created to build the resulting string.
The program enters a for-each loop that iterates over each element of the array.
For each string element in the array, the first character is extracted, converted to uppercase, and appended to the StringBuilder `sb`.
The first character of "atcoder" is 'a', which is converted to 'A' and appended to `sb`.
The first character of "beginner" is 'b', which is converted to 'B' and appended to `sb`.
The first character of "contest" is 'c', which is converted to 'C' and appended to `sb`.
After the loop, the StringBuilder `sb` contains the string "ABC".
The content of `sb` is converted to a string and printed out.
<<<Output>>>
ABC
