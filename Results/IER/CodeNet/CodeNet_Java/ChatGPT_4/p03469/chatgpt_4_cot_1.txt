<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in).
It reads a line of text from the input and stores it in the String variable S. Given the input, S is initialized with the value "2017/01/07".
The toCharArray() method is called on the String S, which converts the string into a character array and stores it in the char array c.
The code then prints "2018" without a newline character.
A for loop is initiated with the index i starting from 4, which corresponds to the character after "2017" in the input string.
The loop iterates over the remaining characters in the char array c, starting from the character at index 4 to the end of the array, and prints each character without a newline.
Given the input, the characters from index 4 to the end are "/01/07".
Therefore, the output will be "2018" followed by "/01/07", resulting in "2018/01/07".
