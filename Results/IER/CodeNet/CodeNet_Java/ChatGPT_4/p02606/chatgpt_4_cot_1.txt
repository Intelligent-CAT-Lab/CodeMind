<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read from standard input. It then reads three integers L, R, and d, which are set to 5, 10, and 2 respectively according to the input.

The variable Ans is initialized to 0. A for loop is then used to iterate from L (5) to R (10) inclusive. For each integer i in this range, the code checks if i is divisible by d (2) without a remainder using the modulus operator (i % d == 0). If the condition is true, Ans is incremented by 1.

The loop will check the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Among these, 6, 8, and 10 are divisible by 2, so Ans will be incremented three times.

After the loop finishes, the final value of Ans, which is 3, is printed to the standard output.
