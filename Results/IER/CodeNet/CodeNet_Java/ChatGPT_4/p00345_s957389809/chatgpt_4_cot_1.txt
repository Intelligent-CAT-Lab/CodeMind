<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `0.(3)`. The program starts by initializing variables o, p, l, d to -1 and strings all and sub to empty strings. It then enters a for loop to iterate over each character of the input string.

1. The first character '0' is not a '.', '(', or ')', so it is appended to the string all.
2. The second character '.' sets o to 1 (the index of '.').
3. The third character '(' sets p to 2 (the index of '(') and assigns the current value of all to sub, which is "0".
4. The fourth character '3' is appended to all, making all = "03".
5. The fifth character ')' does not change any variables.

After the loop, the program calculates d as the length of the input string minus o minus 1, which is 5 - 1 - 1 = 3. It calculates l as p - o - 1, which is 2 - 1 - 1 = 0.

Since p is not -1 (it is 2), the program enters the else block. It adjusts d by subtracting 2 for the parentheses, so d becomes 3 - 2 = 1. The program then calls the print method with the following arguments:

- Integer.parseInt(all) - Integer.parseInt(sub), which is 3 - 0 = 3.
- (int)Math.pow(10, d) - (int)Math.pow(10, l), which is 10^1 - 10^0 = 10 - 1 = 9.

Inside the print method, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 3 and 9, which is 3. It then prints the fraction 3/9 reduced by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the gcd, resulting in 1/3.
