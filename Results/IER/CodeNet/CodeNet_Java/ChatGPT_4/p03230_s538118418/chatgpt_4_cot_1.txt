<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3`. The variable `n` is initialized with the value `3`. The variable `els` is initialized with `0`.

The first `if` statement checks if `n` is equal to `1`. Since `n` is `3`, this condition is not met, and the program does not enter this block.

The program then initializes a variable `canner` with `1` and enters a `for` loop that will iterate until `canner` is greater than `100000`. In each iteration, `canner` is incremented by `i`, which starts at `2` and increases by `1` each iteration.

The loop checks if `canner` is equal to `n` after each increment. On the first iteration, `canner` becomes `3` (`1 + 2`), which is equal to `n`. Therefore, the program prints "Yes", sets `els` to `2` (the current value of `i`), and breaks out of the loop.

Since `els` is now `2`, the program does not enter the second `if` statement that checks if `els` is `0`.

The program then prints `els + 1`, which is `3`.

Next, the program initializes a 2D array `table` with dimensions `els` by `els + 1`, which is `2` by `3`.

The program then enters a nested loop to fill the `table` array. The outer loop runs from `offset = 0` to `els - 1` (which is `1`), and the inner loops run from `x = offset` to `els - 1` and from `y = offset + 1` to `els`. The `table` array is filled with a sequence of numbers starting from `1`, incrementing by `1` for each cell, and wrapping around to the next row when reaching the end of the current row.

After filling the `table`, the program uses a `StringBuilder` to construct the output string. It iterates over the `table` array and appends the values to the `StringBuilder`, formatting the output as specified.

Finally, the program prints the content of the `StringBuilder`.

The expected output will be "Yes", followed by the number `3`, and then the `table` array formatted as specified in the code.
