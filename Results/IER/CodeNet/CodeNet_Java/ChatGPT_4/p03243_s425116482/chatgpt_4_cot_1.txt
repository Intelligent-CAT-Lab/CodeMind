<<<Analysis>>>
The input "111" is read as a string and stored in the variable `n`. The first character of the string '1' is extracted using `n.charAt(0)` and converted to its integer value by subtracting 48 (the ASCII value of '0') to get the integer 1, which is stored in the variable `san`.

The variable `ok` is calculated by multiplying `san` by 100, adding `san` multiplied by 10, and then adding `san` again. This results in `ok` being 111.

The program then checks if the integer value of the input string `n` (which is 111) is less than or equal to `ok` (which is also 111). Since 111 is equal to 111, the condition is true, and the program prints the value of `ok`, which is 111.

The `out.flush()` method is called to ensure that the output is sent to the console.
