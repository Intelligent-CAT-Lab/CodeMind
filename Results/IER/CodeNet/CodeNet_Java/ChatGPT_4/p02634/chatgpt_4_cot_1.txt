<<<Analysis>>>
The input `1 1 2 2` initializes A, B, C, and D with 1, 1, 2, and 2 respectively. The cell array is a 2x2 array since C and D are 2.

The constructor initializes the cell array with all zeros and then sets cell[0][0] to 1 because A and B are 1, so A-1 and B-1 are 0. The loops in the constructor fill the first row and the first column of the cell array with the values according to the given formula. Since A and B are 1, the loops do not change the values because they start from A and B, which are equal to C and D respectively.

The `calc` method is supposed to calculate the values for the rest of the cells, but since A, B, C, and D are all 2, there are no other cells to calculate. The `calc` method would only affect cells if C and D were greater than A and B respectively.

Finally, the `showResult` method prints the value of the bottom-right cell, which is cell[1][1] (since C and D are 2). This cell has not been changed from its initial value of 0.

Therefore, the output of the code execution will be 0.
