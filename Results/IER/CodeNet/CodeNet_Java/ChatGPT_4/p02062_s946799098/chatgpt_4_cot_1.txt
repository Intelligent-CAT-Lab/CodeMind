<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `?&?|?&?|?&?` is read and converted to a character array S. The program then parses this array to build a tree-like structure representing the logical expression, where `|` represents OR operations and `&` represents AND operations. The `?` represents a term in the expression.

The parsing starts with `parseOr()` which creates an `ExprOr` object and adds the first AND expression parsed by `parseAnd()`. The `parseOr()` function continues to parse AND expressions separated by `|` until the end of the array is reached.

The `parseAnd()` function creates an `ExprAnd` object and adds the first term parsed by `parseTerm()`. It continues to parse terms separated by `&` until the next character is not `&`.

The `parseTerm()` function checks if the current character is `(`, which is not the case in our input. Since the input only contains `?`, it simply creates a `Term` object and increments `pos`.

After parsing, the program calculates the cost of the expression. The cost is calculated by traversing the tree structure and combining the costs of subexpressions. The cost of a term is 1 for both cost0 and cost1. The cost of an AND expression is the minimum of the sum of cost1 of all terms and the sum of cost0 of all terms plus cost1 of one term. The cost of an OR expression is the minimum of the sum of cost1 of all AND expressions and the sum of cost0 of all AND expressions plus cost1 of one AND expression.

The input expression is equivalent to `(?&?)|(?&?)|(?&?)`. Each `?&?` has a cost0 of 2 (since both terms have cost0 of 1) and a cost1 of 1 (since we can choose one term with cost1 and add the cost0 of the other term). There are three such AND expressions separated by OR.

For the OR expression, the cost1 is the minimum of the cost1 of all AND expressions, which is 1. The cost0 is the sum of the cost0 of all AND expressions, which is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Therefore, the final output should be the cost0 and cost1 of the OR expression, which is "6 1".
