<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that creates an instance of `Main` and calls its `solve` method. The `solve` method uses a `FastScanner` class to read two characters, `X` and `Y`, from the input.

The ASCII values for the characters are compared to determine their lexicographical order. If `X` is less than `Y`, the answer is set to "<". If `X` is greater than `Y`, the answer is set to ">". If they are equal, the answer remains "=".

Given the input `A B`, the ASCII value for `A` is 65 and for `B` is 66. Since 65 (A) is less than 66 (B), the answer will be set to "<".

The `out` method is then called with the answer, which prints the result to the `PrintWriter` `pw`. Finally, `pw.close()` is called in the `main` method to flush the output stream and close the `PrintWriter`.

Therefore, the output will be "<" because `A` is lexicographically less than `B`.
