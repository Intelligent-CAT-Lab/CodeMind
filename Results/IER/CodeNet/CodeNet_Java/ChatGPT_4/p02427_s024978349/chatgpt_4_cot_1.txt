<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input. The variable factorial is calculated as 2 raised to the power of n, which is 2^4 = 16.

The program then enters a for loop that iterates from i = 0 to i = 15 (since factorial is 16). In each iteration, it converts the current value of i to its binary string representation using Integer.toBinaryString(i).

The inner for loop iterates over the length of the binary string representation of i. It assigns each character of the binary string to the corresponding index in the character array cha.

After the inner for loop, the program prints the current value of i followed by a colon.

Then, another for loop iterates over the length of the binary string representation of i again. This time, it checks if the character at the index (str.length() - j - 1) in the array cha is '1'. If it is, it prints the index j. This effectively prints the positions of the bits that are set to '1' in the binary representation of i, but in reverse order (from least significant bit to most significant bit).

The program prints a new line after each iteration of the outer for loop.

Given the input 4, the program will print the binary representations of the numbers 0 to 15, along with the positions of the bits that are set to '1', in reverse order.
