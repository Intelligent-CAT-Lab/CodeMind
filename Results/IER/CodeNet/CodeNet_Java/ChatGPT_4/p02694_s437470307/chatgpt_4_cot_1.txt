<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 103 according to the input. The variable P is initialized with 100, and the variable cnt (count) is initialized with 0.
The code enters a while loop that will continue to execute as long as P is less than X.
Inside the while loop, P is increased by 1% of its current value (P/100), and cnt is incremented by 1.
The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: P = 100 + 100/100 = 100 + 1 = 101, cnt = 1
- Second iteration: P = 101 + 101/100 = 101 + 1 = 102, cnt = 2
- Third iteration: P = 102 + 102/100 = 102 + 1 = 103, cnt = 3
- The loop condition is now P < X (103 < 103), which is false, so the loop terminates.

The final value of cnt is 3, which is the number of years it took for the initial amount P to reach at least X.
