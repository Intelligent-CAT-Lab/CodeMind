<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads the first token of input and assigns it to the variable 'string'. The next token of input is read and assigned to the variable 'tString'. The Scanner's next() method is used, which reads input until it encounters a space, so it will read "oder" as 'string' and "atc" as 'tString'. The code then prints the concatenation of 'tString' and 'string', which results in "atcoder". Finally, the Scanner is closed with in.close().
<<<Output>>>
atcoder
