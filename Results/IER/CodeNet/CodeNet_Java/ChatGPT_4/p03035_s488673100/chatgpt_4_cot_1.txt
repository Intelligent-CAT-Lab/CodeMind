<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `30 100`. The FastScanner class reads the input and assigns the value 30 to variable A and 100 to variable B.

The main method then checks the value of A:
- If A is greater than or equal to 13, it prints the value of B.
- If A is greater than 5 but less than 13, it prints half the value of B.
- If A is less than or equal to 5, it prints 0.

Since A is 30, which is greater than or equal to 13, the condition `A >= 13` is true. Therefore, the program will print the value of B without any modifications.

<<<Output>>>
100
