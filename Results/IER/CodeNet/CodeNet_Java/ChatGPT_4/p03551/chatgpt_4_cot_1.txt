<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable base is calculated as n*100+m*1800, which is 1*100+1*1800 = 100+1800 = 1900.
The expression `base << m` performs a left bit shift on the value of base by m positions. Since m is 1, this means that the value of base (1900) will be shifted left by 1 bit.
In binary, 1900 is 11101101100. Shifting this left by 1 bit results in 111011011000, which is 3800 in decimal.
Therefore, the output will be 3800.
<<<Output>>>
3800
