<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `3`, which initializes the variable `n` with the value 3.

The code initializes an array `ex` of size 1001 with all elements set to 0. This array will be used to store the exponents of the prime factors of each number from 2 to `n`.

The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive). For each iteration, it calls the `primeFactorize` method to get the prime factors and their exponents for the current number `i`.

The `primeFactorize` method works as follows:
- It initializes an empty list `res` to store the prime factors and their exponents.
- It then enters a for loop, checking each number `a` from 2 up to the square root of `n`.
- If `n` is divisible by `a`, it counts how many times `a` divides `n` (this is the exponent `ex`) and divides `n` by `a` each time.
- It then adds a map with the prime factor `a` and its exponent `ex` to the list `res`.
- If after this process `n` is not 1, it means `n` is a prime number and it adds `n` with an exponent of 1 to the list `res`.

For the input `3`, the prime factorization will be as follows:
- For `i = 2`: prime factor is 2 with exponent 1.
- For `i = 3`: prime factor is 3 with exponent 1.

The exponents of the prime factors are then added to the corresponding index in the `ex` array. After the loop, the `ex` array will have the following values:
- `ex[2] = 1` (since 2 is a prime factor of 2 with exponent 1)
- `ex[3] = 1` (since 3 is a prime factor of 3 with exponent 1)

The code then initializes a variable `ans` with the value 1 and enters another for loop from 2 to `n` (inclusive). In each iteration, it multiplies `ans` by `ex[i] + 1` and takes the result modulo `MOD` (which is 1000000007).

The calculation of `ans` will be as follows:
- For `i = 2`: `ans *= ex[2] + 1` which is `ans *= 1 + 1` so `ans = 2`.
- For `i = 3`: `ans *= ex[3] + 1` which is `ans *= 1 + 1` so `ans = 2 * 2 = 4`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`, which is 4.
