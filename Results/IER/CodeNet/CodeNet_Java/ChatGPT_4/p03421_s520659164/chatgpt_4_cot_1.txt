The variables n, A, and B are initialized with 5, 3, and 2 respectively according to the input.

The method `check` is called with the arguments 5, 3, and 2. Inside the `check` method:
- It first checks if A or B is greater than n, which is not the case here.
- Then it calculates the shortest possible length of the subsequence that can be formed by dividing n by A and taking the ceiling of the result. In this case, `shortest` is calculated as `(5/3)+1` which equals 2.
- It then checks if B is greater than or equal to `shortest`. Since B is 2, which is equal to `shortest`, the check passes and returns true.

Since the check method returns true, the program does not print -1 and does not exit. It proceeds to the main part of the program.

The variables `lowerBound` and `start` are initialized to 0 and 1 respectively.

A for loop is initiated with `cnt` ranging from 1 to A (3 in this case). Inside the loop:
- It calculates `len` as the minimum of B (2) and `n-start-A+cnt+1`. For the first iteration, `len` is the minimum of 2 and `5-1-3+1+1`, which is 2.
- Another for loop is initiated with `j` ranging from 0 to `len` (2 in this case). Inside this loop, it prints `lowerBound+len-j` followed by a space. For the first iteration, it prints `2 1 `.
- `start` is then incremented by `len` (becomes 3), and `lowerBound` is also incremented by `len` (becomes 2).

The for loop continues for `cnt` 2 and 3. In the second iteration, `len` is the minimum of 2 and `5-3-3+2+1`, which is 1. It prints `3 `.
In the third iteration, `len` is the minimum of 2 and `5-4-3+3+1`, which is 1. It prints `4 `.

Finally, the program flushes the output, which contains the sequence of numbers printed.
