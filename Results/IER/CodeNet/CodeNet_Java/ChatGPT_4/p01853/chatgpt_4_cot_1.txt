<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with the `main` method and a `FastScanner` class to read input. The `FastScanner` class is designed to read input more efficiently than the standard `Scanner` class in Java.

The `main` method creates an instance of `FastScanner` and reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input. In this case, `n` is 3 and `m` is 100.

The code then checks if `n` is even. If `n` is even, it prints a sequence of `n/2 + 1` zeros followed by `n/2 - 1` occurrences of `m`. If `n` is odd, it prints the same sequence as if `n` were even. This is because the if and else blocks contain the same code.

Since `n` is 3, which is odd, the code will execute the else block. However, as mentioned, the if and else blocks are identical, so the output would be the same regardless.

The output will start with a 0, followed by `n/2` (which is 1) more zeros, and then `n/2` (which is 1) occurrences of `m` (which is 100). Since `n` is 3, there will be a total of 2 zeros and 1 occurrence of 100 in the output.
