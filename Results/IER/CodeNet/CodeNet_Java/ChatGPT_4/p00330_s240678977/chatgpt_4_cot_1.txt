<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read from the standard input. In the main method, it reads an integer from the input using sc.nextInt() and multiplies it by 32. The result of this multiplication is then printed to the standard output using out.println().

Given the input `4`, the code will read this integer and multiply it by 32, which results in 128. Therefore, the output will be 128.
<<<Output>>>
128
