<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and X are initialized with 180, 100, and 2400 respectively according to the input.

The variable T is calculated as X / 500, which is 2400 / 500 = 4.
The variable n is calculated as X / 1000, which is 2400 / 1000 = 2.

The if condition checks if X % 1000 == 0, which is false for 2400, so O is calculated as A * (n + 1), which is 180 * (2 + 1) = 540.

The if condition checks if X % 500 == 0, which is true for 2400, so G is calculated as B * T, which is 100 * 4 = 400.

The variable mini is initialized with a large number 99999999 to find the minimum value in the upcoming loop.

The for loop iterates 1000 times, and for each iteration, it calculates the cost nedan for a combination of 1000-yen and 500-yen bills that sum up to at least X yen.

For i = 0 to i = 2 (since X >= i * 1000 is false for i > 2), the following calculations occur:
- For i = 0: z = 2400, y = 4, nedan = 0 * 180 + 4 * 100 = 400, mini = 400 (since 400 <= 99999999).
- For i = 1: z = 1400, y = 2, nedan = 1 * 180 + 3 * 100 = 480, mini = 400 (since 480 > 400).
- For i = 2: z = 400, y = 0, nedan = 2 * 180 + 1 * 100 = 460, mini = 400 (since 460 > 400).

After the loop, mini remains 400.

The final if-else conditions check which of O, G, or mini is the smallest:
- O is 540, G is 400, and mini is 400.
- Since G and mini are equal and less than O, the output will be the value of G or mini, which is 400.
