<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in).
It then reads an integer value from the input and stores it in the variable 'a'. According to the given input, 'a' is assigned the value 4.
Next, the code calculates the square of 'a' (which is 4 * 4 = 16) and then multiplies it by 3 (16 * 3 = 48).
Finally, the result of this calculation (48) is printed to the standard output.
<<<Output>>>
48
