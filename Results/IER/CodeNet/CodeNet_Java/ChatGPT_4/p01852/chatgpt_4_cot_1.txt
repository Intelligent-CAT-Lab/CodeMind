<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 0 according to the input. The variable count is initialized with 0.
The code checks if n is greater than 0, which it is not, so the while loop is not executed.
Since the condition of the if statement is not met, the count is not incremented.
The program then prints the value of count, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
