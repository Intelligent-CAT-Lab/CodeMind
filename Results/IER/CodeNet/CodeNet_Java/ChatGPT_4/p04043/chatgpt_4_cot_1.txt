<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three integer variables a, b, and c with the input values. According to the input, a is set to 5, b is set to 5, and c is set to 7.
It then checks if the combination of a, b, and c is either 5, 7, 5 or 5, 5, 7 or 7, 5, 5. If any of these conditions are true, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, the input matches the second condition (a == 5, b == 5, c == 7), so the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
