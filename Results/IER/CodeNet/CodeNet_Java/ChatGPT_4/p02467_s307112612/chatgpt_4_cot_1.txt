The input is `12`. The `solve` method is called, which reads this input as an integer `n` using the `ni()` method. The `primeFactorize` method is then called with `n` as the argument.

The `primeFactorize` method creates an instance of the `Prime` class with the square root of `n` plus 1 as the argument, which in this case is `sqrt(12) + 1 = 3.46 + 1 = 4.46`, so an integer value of `4` is passed to the `Prime` constructor.

The `Prime` constructor initializes an array `isPrime` of size `n + 1` (which is 5 in this case) and an `ArrayList` of integers called `primes`. It then calls the `sieve` method to populate the `primes` list with prime numbers up to `n` (4 in this case). The `sieve` method uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to `n`. The primes up to 4 are `2` and `3`.

The `primeFactorize` method then iterates over the list of primes and checks if `n` (12) is divisible by each prime. It finds that 12 is divisible by 2, and it counts how many times 2 divides 12 (which is 2 times, as 12/2 = 6 and 6/2 = 3). It then adds the prime number 2 and its count 2 to the `TreeMap` `ret`. The loop continues and checks the next prime, which is 3. It finds that 3 divides the remaining quotient (3) once, so it adds the prime number 3 and its count 1 to the `TreeMap`.

Since there are no more primes in the list and the remaining quotient is 1, the `primeFactorize` method returns the `TreeMap` containing `{2=2, 3=1}`.

Back in the `solve` method, the `TreeMap` is iterated over, and the output is constructed by appending each prime and its count to the string "12:". The output for each prime is the prime number followed by a space, repeated as many times as the count. Therefore, the output for the prime 2 is " 2 2" (since the count is 2), and the output for the prime 3 is " 3" (since the count is 1).

Finally, the `solve` method prints the constructed output and a newline character.
