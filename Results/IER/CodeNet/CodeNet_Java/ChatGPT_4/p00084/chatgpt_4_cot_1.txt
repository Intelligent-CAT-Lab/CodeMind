<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and processes it as follows:

1. The input string "Rain, rain, go to Spain." is read.
2. The string is modified by replacing all occurrences of '.' with ',' resulting in "Rain, rain, go to Spain,".
3. Then, all occurrences of ',' are replaced with a space, resulting in "Rain  rain  go to Spain ".
4. The string is split into tokens based on spaces, resulting in an array of strings: ["Rain", "", "rain", "", "go", "to", "Spain", ""].
5. The code then iterates over each token in the array and checks if the length of the token is between 3 and 6 characters inclusive.
6. If a token meets the length condition, it is printed. If it's not the first token that meets the condition, a space is printed before it.
7. The tokens "Rain", "rain", "Spain" meet the length condition and are printed with spaces between them.

The output will be the tokens that have a length between 3 and 6 characters inclusive, separated by spaces.

<<<Output>>>
Rain rain Spain
