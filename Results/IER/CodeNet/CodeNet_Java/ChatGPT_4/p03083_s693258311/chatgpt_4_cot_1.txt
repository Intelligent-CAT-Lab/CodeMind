<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to solve a problem related to probabilities, but the actual mathematical problem is not described in the provided code. However, we can analyze the code execution step by step based on the given input `2 1`.

The input `2 1` initializes `b` with 2 and `w` with 1. The `ModMath` class is used to perform modular arithmetic with a default modulus of 1_000_000_007 (MOD). The `Exponentiation` and `Factorial` classes are used to compute powers and factorials modulo MOD, respectively.

The `solve` method in the `EBlackOrWhite` class performs the following steps:
1. It creates an instance of `ModMath` and uses it to create `Exponentiation` and `Factorial` objects with a maximum value of `b + w + 1`, which is 4 in this case.
2. It initializes two long variables `p` and `q` to 0.
3. It enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to `b + w`, which is 3 in this case.
4. Inside the loop, it calculates a value using the formula `(1 - p + q + MOD) % MOD * exp.pow(-1) % MOD` and prints it using `out.ansln`.
5. It updates the values of `p` and `q` using the `ncr` method of the `Factorial` class and the `pow` method of the `Exponentiation` class. The `ncr` method calculates the binomial coefficient (n choose r) modulo MOD.

The `ncr` method will return 0 if `n < r`, which will happen when `i - 1 < b - 1` or `i - 1 < w - 1`. Since `b` is 2 and `w` is 1, the `ncr` method will return non-zero values only when `i` is 2 or 3.

The `pow` method of the `Exponentiation` class calculates the power of 2 modulo MOD. When the exponent is negative, it uses the precomputed reverse array to find the modular multiplicative inverse.

The `out.ansln` method prints the calculated value followed by a newline.

Given the complexity of the code and the mathematical operations involved, it is not feasible to manually calculate the exact output without running the code. The output will consist of 3 lines of numbers, each representing the calculated value for each iteration of the loop.
