<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads three integers a, b, and c from the input, which are 5, 7, and 5 respectively.

The code then has three if statements to check if any two of the three integers are equal. If two integers are equal, it prints the third integer.

1. The first if statement checks if a is equal to b (5 == 7), which is false.
2. The second if statement checks if b is equal to c (7 == 5), which is also false.
3. The third if statement checks if c is equal to a (5 == 5), which is true.

Since the third condition is true, the code prints the value of b, which is 7.

Finally, the code prints an empty line with `System.out.println("");`.

<<<Output>>>
7
