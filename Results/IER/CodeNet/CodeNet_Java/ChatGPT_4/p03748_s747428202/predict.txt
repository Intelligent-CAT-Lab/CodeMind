<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 3` initializes `n` with 2 (the total number of blocks) and `m` with 3 (the number of operations).

The code initializes a 3-dimensional array `dp` with dimensions [2][n + 1][2]. This array is used to store the number of paths to reach a certain block after a certain number of operations, with the last dimension indicating whether the left end has been reached (1) or not (0).

The initial state of `dp` is set such that `dp[0][i][0]` is 1 for all `i` except when `i` is 0, in which case `dp[0][i][1]` is set to 1. This represents the starting condition where there is one way to be at each block without having reached the left end, except for the leftmost block where there is one way to be there having reached the left end.

The code then enters a loop that runs `m` times, representing the number of operations. Inside this loop, it calculates the number of paths to each block after each operation. It considers moving left, moving right, and moving left then back to the original position, and moving right then back to the original position.

After each operation, the code resets the `dp` array for the previous operation to all zeros to prepare for the next iteration.

Finally, the code sums up all the paths that end at any block having reached the left end after `m` operations and prints this sum modulo `MODULO`.

Let's calculate the number of paths manually:

After the first operation (m=1), we can move from block 1 to 2, from block 2 to 1 or 3, and from block 3 to 2. We also consider moving left and then back to the original position, and moving right then back to the original position. The `dp` array after the first operation will look like this:

dp[1][0][0] = 0
dp[1][0][1] = 0
dp[1][1][0] = 2 (from block 2 to 1 and back, from block 3 to 2 and back)
dp[1][1][1] = 1 (from block 1 to 2 and back)
dp[1][2][0] = 2 (from block 1 to 2 and back, from block 3 to 2 and back)
dp[1][2][1] = 0
dp[1][3][0] = 1 (from block 2 to 3)
dp[1][3][1] = 0

After the second operation (m=2), we repeat the process, and the `dp` array will look like this:

dp[0][0][0] = 0
dp[0][0][1] = 0
dp[0][1][0] = 3 (from block 2 to 1 and back, from block 3 to 2 and back, from block 2 to 1)
dp[0][1][1] = 3 (from block 1 to 2 and back, from block 2 to 3 and back, from block 1 to 2)
dp[0][2][0] = 4 (from block 1 to 2 and back, from block 3 to 2 and back, from block 1 to 2, from block 3 to 2)
dp[0][2][1] = 0
dp[0][3][0] = 2 (from block 2 to 3, from block 2 to 3 and back)
dp[0][3][1] = 0

After the third operation (m=3), we repeat the process again, and the `dp` array will look like this:

dp[1][0][0] = 0
dp[1][0][1] = 0
dp[1][1][0] = 6 (from block 2 to 1 and back, from block 3 to 2 and back, from block 2 to 1, from block 2 to 1 and back, from block 3 to 2, from block 2 to 1)
dp[1][1][1] = 6 (from block 1 to 2 and back, from block 2 to 3 and back, from block 1 to 2, from block 1 to 2 and back, from block 2 to 3, from block 1 to 2)
dp[1][2][0] = 9 (from block 1 to 2 and back,
