The variable n is initialized with 575 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The main method calls the dfs method with the string "0" as its initial argument.

The dfs method is a recursive method that generates numbers by appending "3", "5", or "7" to the current string value. It stops generating new numbers when the current number (converted from string to long) exceeds n, which is 575.

The dfs method checks if the current string contains "3", "5", and "7". If it does, it increments the ans variable by 1. This is to count numbers that include at least one of each of the digits 3, 5, and 7.

The dfs method is called three times within itself, each time appending "3", "5", or "7" to the current string value. This creates a tree of recursive calls that generate all possible combinations of the numbers 3, 5, and 7 up to the limit of 575.

The numbers that contain at least one "3", one "5", and one "7" and are less than or equal to 575 are:
- 357
- 375
- 537
- 573
- 735
- 753

Each of these numbers will result in the ans variable being incremented by 1 when they are generated in the dfs method.

Therefore, the final value of ans after all recursive calls have completed will be 6.
