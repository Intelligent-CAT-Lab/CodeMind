<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the value 2 according to the input. The code then enters a nested loop structure with two loops, one iterating over i and the other over j, both ranging from 1 to 3509.

Inside the inner loop, the code calculates two long values, si and bo, based on the current values of i, j, and n. The formula for si is n * i * j, and for bo, it is 4 * i * j - n * j - n * i.

The code then checks if bo is less than or equal to 0, and if it is, it continues to the next iteration of the inner loop without executing the following if statement. This is because a non-positive value of bo would lead to division by zero or a negative denominator, which is not allowed.

If bo is positive, the code checks if si is divisible by bo (si % bo == 0). If this condition is true, it means that the values of i, j, and si / bo are a valid solution to the problem, and the code prints these three values and returns, ending the program.

For the input `2`, the code will find the first combination of i and j where si % bo == 0. This will happen when i = 1 and j = 1, as the calculations will be as follows:

si = n * i * j = 2 * 1 * 1 = 2
bo = 4 * i * j - n * j - n * i = 4 * 1 * 1 - 2 * 1 - 2 * 1 = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0

Since bo is 0, the code will continue to the next iteration without checking divisibility. The next combination where bo is positive and si is divisible by bo is when i = 1 and j = 2:

si = n * i * j = 2 * 1 * 2 = 4
bo = 4 * i * j - n * j - n * i = 4 * 1 * 2 - 2 * 2 - 2 * 1 = 8 - 4 - 2 = 2

Since si % bo == 0 (4 % 2 == 0), the code will print the values of i, j, and si / bo, which are 1, 2, and 2 respectively, and then return.
