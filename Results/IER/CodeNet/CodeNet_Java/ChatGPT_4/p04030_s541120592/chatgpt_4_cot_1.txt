The input string `s` is initialized with "01B0". The string `t` is initialized as an empty string.
The for loop iterates over each character of the string `s`.

1. In the first iteration, `i=0`, `s.charAt(i)` is '0'. Since it is not 'B', it is appended to `t`. Now `t` is "0".
2. In the second iteration, `i=1`, `s.charAt(i)` is '1'. Since it is not 'B', it is appended to `t`. Now `t` is "01".
3. In the third iteration, `i=2`, `s.charAt(i)` is 'B'. Since it is 'B', and `t.length()` is not 0, the last character of `t` is removed. Now `t` is "0".
4. In the fourth iteration, `i=3`, `s.charAt(i)` is '0'. Since it is not 'B', it is appended to `t`. Now `t` is "00".

After the loop finishes, the final value of `t` is "00", which is printed as the output.
