<<<Analysis>>>
The variable val is initialized with 12 according to the input. The variable a is initialized with 2.
The code prints "12:" without a newline.
It enters a while loop that continues as long as val is greater than or equal to the square of a.
Inside the while loop, it checks if val is divisible by a. If it is, it prints " " followed by the value of a, and then divides val by a. This process is repeated as long as val is divisible by a.
For the input 12, the loop runs as follows:
- 12 is divisible by 2, so it prints " 2" and val becomes 6.
- 6 is still divisible by 2, so it prints " 2" again and val becomes 3.
- 3 is not divisible by 2, so a is incremented to 3.
- 3 is divisible by 3, so it prints " 3" and val becomes 1.
- The loop condition is no longer met because 1 is not greater than or equal to 3*3.

After the loop, it prints " " followed by the final value of val, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
12: 2 2 3 1
