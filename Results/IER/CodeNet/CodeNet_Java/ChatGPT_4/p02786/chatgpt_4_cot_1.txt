<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a single long integer `2`. The FastReader class is used to read this input. The variable `h` is initialized with the value `2`. The program checks if `h` is equal to `1`, which it is not, so it skips the `if` block and goes to the `else` block.

Inside the `else` block, a variable `count` is initialized with the value `1` and a variable `sum` is initialized with the value `0`. The program enters a `while` loop that will continue as long as `h` is greater than `1`.

In the first iteration of the `while` loop:
- `h` is `2`, which is greater than `1`, so the loop continues.
- `h` is divided by `2` and becomes `1`.
- `sum` is incremented by `2^count`, which is `2^1 = 2`.
- `count` is incremented to `2`.

The loop condition is checked again, and since `h` is now `1`, the loop terminates.

Finally, the program prints `sum + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`.
