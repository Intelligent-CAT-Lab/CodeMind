<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with the `main` method that creates an instance of `Main` and calls the `run` method on it. The `run` method reads an integer `S` from the standard input using a `Scanner` object. In this case, the input is `2`.

The variable `S` is then used to calculate the cube of the number by multiplying `S` by itself three times, which is stored in the variable `ans`. The calculation for the input `2` would be `2 * 2 * 2`, which equals `8`.

Finally, the code prints out the value of `ans` to the standard output, which is the result of the cube of the input number.

<<<Output>>>
8
