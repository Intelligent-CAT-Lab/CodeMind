<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided initializes n with 5 and k with 3. The program then creates an ArrayList of Pair objects to store pairs of integers.

The for loop adds pairs (1, i) for i from 2 to n (inclusive) to the list l. This results in the following pairs being added to l: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5).

The variable now is calculated as (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2, which is (5 - 1) * (5 - 2) / 2 = 4 * 3 / 2 = 6. This represents the maximum number of edges that can be removed from a complete graph to still have a connected graph.

Since now (6) is not less than k (3), the program does not print "-1" and continues.

The program enters a while loop that will run as long as now is greater than k. The loop adds new pairs (from, to) to the list l and decrements now each time. The loop is designed to add edges between other vertices (not vertex 1) to reduce the number of edges that can be removed while still maintaining a connected graph.

The loop runs until now equals k. In this case, since now is 6 and k is 3, the loop will run 3 times. The pairs added will be (2, 3), (2, 4), and (2, 5) because the conditions inside the loop will increment 'to' until it equals n, then increment 'from' and reset 'to' to 'from' + 1.

After the loop, the program prints the size of the list l, which is the number of pairs, followed by each pair on a new line.

The final list l contains the pairs: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5). The size of this list is 7.
