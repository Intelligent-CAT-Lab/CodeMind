The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method and a nested `FastScanner` class. The `FastScanner` class is designed to read input efficiently from the `System.in` InputStream.

The `main` method creates an instance of `FastScanner` and a `PrintWriter` for output. It then reads two integers using the `nextInt` method of `FastScanner` and calculates the maximum of the first integer minus the second integer and 0. This result is printed to the console.

The `FastScanner` class has methods to read bytes from the input stream and interpret them as integers. The `nextInt` method reads bytes until it forms a valid integer. If the byte corresponds to a minus sign, it sets a flag to return a negative number. It then reads subsequent bytes, ensuring they are digits, to form the integer. If it encounters a non-digit printable character or the end of the stream, it returns the number formed so far.

Given the input `100 17`, the `nextInt` method will be called twice. The first call will read `100` and the second call will read `17`. The `Math.max` function will then calculate `100 - 17`, which is `83`, and compare it with `0`. Since `83` is greater than `0`, the function will return `83`.

The `PrintWriter` then prints `83` to the console and flushes the stream to ensure the output is written out immediately.
