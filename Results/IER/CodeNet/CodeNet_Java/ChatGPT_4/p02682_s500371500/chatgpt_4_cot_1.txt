<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `FastReader` class for fast input reading, and a `main` method where the actual logic is implemented. The input is read as four long integers: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `k`.

Given the input `2 1 1 3`, the variables are initialized as follows:
- `a` = 2
- `b` = 1
- `c` = 1
- `k` = 3

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

The code then performs the following steps:
1. `ans` is increased by the minimum of `a` and `k`, which is `Math.min(2, 3)` = 2. So `ans` becomes 2.
2. `k` is decreased by the same amount, so `k` becomes `3 - 2` = 1.
3. `k` is further decreased by the minimum of `b` and the new `k`, which is `Math.min(1, 1)` = 1. So `k` becomes `1 - 1` = 0.
4. Since `k` is now 0, the condition `if(k > 0)` is false, and the code inside the if block is not executed.

Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`, which is 2, and closes the output stream.
