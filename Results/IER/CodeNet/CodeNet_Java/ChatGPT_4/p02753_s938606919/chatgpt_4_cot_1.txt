<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a method `solve()` that checks if the input string is either "AAA" or "BBB". If it is, the method prints "No", otherwise it prints "Yes".

The `run()` method sets up the necessary `BufferedReader` and `PrintWriter` for input and output, calls the `solve()` method to perform the check, and then closes the input and output streams.

The `main()` method simply creates an instance of `Main` and calls the `run()` method.

The `nextLine()` method is used to read a line of input from the user, which in this case is expected to be the string `ABA`.

Since `ABA` is neither "AAA" nor "BBB", the `solve()` method will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
