<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is `fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.`. The program will iterate over each character of the string and check if it is a lowercase letter or an uppercase letter. If it is a lowercase letter, it will convert it to uppercase, and if it is an uppercase letter, it will convert it to lowercase. Other characters (such as spaces, commas, and periods) will remain unchanged.

The program processes the input as follows:
- 'f' is lowercase, so it is converted to 'F'.
- 'A' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'a'.
- 'I' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'i'.
- 'R' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'r'.
- ',' remains unchanged.
- ' ' (space) remains unchanged.
- 'L' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'l'.
- 'A' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'a'.
- 'T' is uppercase, so it is converted to 't'.
- 'E' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'e'.
- 'R' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'r'.
- ',' remains unchanged.
- ' ' (space) remains unchanged.
- 'O' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'o'.
- 'C' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'c'.
- 'C' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'c'.
- 'A' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'a'.
- 'S' is uppercase, so it is converted to 's'.
- 'I' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'i'.
- 'O' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'o'.
- 'N' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'n'.
- 'A' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'a'.
- 'L' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'l'.
- 'L' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'l'.
- 'Y' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'y'.
- ' ' (space) remains unchanged.
- 'C' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'c'.
- 'L' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'l'.
- 'O' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'o'.
- 'U' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'u'.
- 'D' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'd'.
- 'Y' is uppercase, so it is converted to 'y'.
- '.' remains unchanged.

After processing each character, the program prints the transformed string followed by a newline character.
