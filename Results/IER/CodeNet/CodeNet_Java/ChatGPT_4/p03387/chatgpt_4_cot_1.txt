<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array x of size 3 and reads three integers from the input, storing them in x[0], x[1], and x[2]. The input provided is 2, 5, and 4, which are stored in the array as follows: x[0] = 2, x[1] = 5, x[2] = 4.

The code then sorts the array x in ascending order. After sorting, the array becomes: x[0] = 2, x[1] = 4, x[2] = 5.

Next, the code calculates the value of the variable temp as 2 times the largest number in the array (x[2]) minus the sum of the other two numbers (x[1] and x[0]). In this case, temp = 2 * 5 - 4 - 2 = 10 - 4 - 2 = 4.

The code then checks if temp is odd. Since temp is 4, which is even, it does not enter the if block and instead calculates ans as temp / 2. Therefore, ans = 4 / 2 = 2.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 2.
