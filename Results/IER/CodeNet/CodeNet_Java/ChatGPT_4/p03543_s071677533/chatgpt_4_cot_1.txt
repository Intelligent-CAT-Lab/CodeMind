<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "1118". The program then enters the first for loop, which checks if there are three consecutive characters that are the same at the beginning of the string.

In the first for loop, the loop starts with `i = 1` and checks if the character at index `i` is different from the character at index `i-1`. The characters at index 0 and 1 are both '1', so the loop continues. The same check is done for `i = 2`, and since the characters at index 1 and 2 are also both '1', the loop continues. When `i` reaches 2, the condition `if(i == 2)` is met, and the program prints "Yes" and returns, ending the execution.

Since the condition for printing "Yes" is met in the first for loop, the second for loop is never executed, and "No" is not printed.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
