<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that creates an instance of `MyInput` to read input from `System.in` and a `PrintWriter` to write output to `System.out`. It then creates an instance of `Solver` with these two instances and calls the `solve` method on it.

The `Solver` class has a `solve` method that reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `X` using the `ni()` method from the `MyInput` instance. In this case, the input is `3 5 4`, so `A` is 3, `B` is 5, and `X` is 4.

The `solve` method then checks if `X` is less than `A` or greater than `A+B`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

For the given input `3 5 4`, `X` is not less than `A` (4 is not less than 3) and `X` is not greater than `A+B` (4 is not greater than 3+5=8). Therefore, the condition to print "NO" is not met, and the method will print "YES".

YES
