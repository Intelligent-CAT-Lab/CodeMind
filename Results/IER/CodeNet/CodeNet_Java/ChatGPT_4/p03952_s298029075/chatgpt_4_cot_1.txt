<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `4 4`. The variables N and X are initialized with 4, and LEN is calculated as `2*4-1`, which is 7.

The `solve()` method is called. Since N is not equal to 2, it does not return `case_2()`.

The condition `if( X <= 2*N-2 &&  X >= 2 )` is evaluated. With the given values, this condition is `if( 4 <= 2*4-2 &&  4 >= 2 )`, which simplifies to `if( 4 <= 6 &&  4 >= 2 )`. This condition is true, so the code inside the if block is executed.

An integer array `ans` of length LEN (7) is created.

Since X is not equal to 2, the else block is executed. The following assignments are made:
- `ans[N-2]` is assigned `X-2`, which is `4-2`, so `ans[2]` is 2.
- `ans[N-1]` is assigned `X`, so `ans[3]` is 4.
- `ans[N]` is assigned `X+1`, so `ans[4]` is 5.
- `ans[N+1]` is assigned `X-1`, so `ans[5]` is 3.

The for loop then fills in the remaining values of the `ans` array, skipping the indices `N-2` to `N+1` (2 to 5). The variable `v` starts at 1 and is incremented each time a value is assigned, skipping the range `X-2` to `X+1` (2 to 5). The final `ans` array is filled as follows:
- `ans[0]` is 1.
- `ans[1]` is 6.
- `ans[2]` is already set to 2.
- `ans[3]` is already set to 4.
- `ans[4]` is already set to 5.
- `ans[5]` is already set to 3.
- `ans[6]` is 7.

The `solve()` method returns the `ans` array, which is `[1, 6, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7]`.

The main method then prints "Yes" followed by each element of the `ans` array on a new line.
