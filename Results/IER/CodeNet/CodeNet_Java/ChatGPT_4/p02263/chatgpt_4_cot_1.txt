<<<Analysis>>>
The input is "1 2 +". The program uses a Scanner to read this line and then splits it into an array of strings ["1", "2", "+"]. It then iterates over this array.

1. The first element is "1", which is not an operator, so it is parsed as an integer and pushed onto the stack.
2. The second element is "2", which is also not an operator, so it is parsed as an integer and pushed onto the stack.
3. The third element is "+", which is an operator. The program pops two values from the stack (2 and 1, in that order), adds them together (resulting in 3), and pushes the result back onto the stack.

After processing all elements, the program prints the top value of the stack, which is the result of the addition operation.

<<<Output>>>
3
