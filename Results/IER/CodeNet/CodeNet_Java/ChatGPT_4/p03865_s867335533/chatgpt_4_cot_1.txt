<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "aba". The length of the string is 3, which is odd.
The code then checks if the length of the string is even or odd. Since the length is odd, it goes to the else block.
Inside the else block, it checks if the first character of the string is the same as the last character. In this case, 'a' (the first character) is the same as 'a' (the last character).
Since the first and last characters are the same and the length of the string is odd, the code prints "Second".
<<<Output>>>
Second
