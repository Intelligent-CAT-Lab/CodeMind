<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable D. The input provided is `25`, so D is set to 25.

The code then has a series of if statements that check the value of D and print out a corresponding message. Since D is 25, the first if statement's condition is true, and it prints out "Christmas". The subsequent if statements are not executed because there are no else or else if statements to chain them together. Therefore, only the first condition that is true will result in an action, and in this case, it's the condition where D equals 25.

<<<Output>>>
Christmas
