<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with `+-++`. The variable `count` is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates over each character of the string `s`.
- On the first iteration, `i = 0`, the character at index 0 is `+`, so `count` is incremented by 1 and becomes 1.
- On the second iteration, `i = 1`, the character at index 1 is `-`, so `count` is decremented by 1 and becomes 0.
- On the third iteration, `i = 2`, the character at index 2 is `+`, so `count` is incremented by 1 and becomes 1.
- On the fourth iteration, `i = 3`, the character at index 3 is `+`, so `count` is incremented by 1 and becomes 2.
After the loop finishes, the final value of `count` is 2, which is printed as the output.
