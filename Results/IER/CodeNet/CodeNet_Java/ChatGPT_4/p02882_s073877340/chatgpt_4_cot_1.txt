<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and x are initialized with 2, 2, and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable bottleCapacity is calculated as a*a*b, which is 2*2*2 = 8.

The if condition checks if x*2 is less than bottleCapacity. Since x*2 is 8, which is equal to bottleCapacity, the condition is false.

Therefore, the else block is executed. The expression inside the Math.atan function is calculated as follows:
2*(bottleCapacity-x)/(a*a*a) = 2*(8-4)/(2*2*2) = 2*4/8 = 1.

The Math.atan function calculates the arctangent of 1, which is π/4 radians. The Math.toDegrees function then converts this radian value to degrees.

The value of π/4 radians in degrees is 45 degrees.

So, the output of the code will be 45.0, as the Math.toDegrees function returns a double value.

<<<Output>>>
45.0
