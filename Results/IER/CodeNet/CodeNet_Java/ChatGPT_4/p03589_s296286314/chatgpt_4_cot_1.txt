<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input. The program then calculates the starting value for variable starth. Since N % 4 is not equal to 0 (2 % 4 equals 2), starth is set to 3*N/4+1, which is 3*2/4+1 = 1.5+1 = 2.5, but since starth is a long type, it will be 2 (fractional part is discarded).

The program enters a nested for loop with the outer loop iterating over h starting from starth (2) to 3500, and the inner loop iterating over w from 1 to 3*N/4 (which is 1.5, but since w is a long type, it will be 1).

Inside the inner loop, the program checks if 4*h*w-N*w-N*h equals 0. If it does not, it calculates the value of n using the formula N*h*w/(4*h*w-N*w-N*h). It then checks if n is greater than 0 and if 4*h*n*w equals N*(h*n+n*w+h*w). If both conditions are true, it prints the values of h, n, and w and returns, thus terminating the program.

Let's go through the iterations:

1. For h=2 and w=1:
   - The condition 4*h*w-N*w-N*h is not equal to 0 (4*2*1-2*1-2*2 = 8-2-4 = 2).
   - The value of n would be N*h*w/(4*h*w-N*w-N*h) = 2*2*1/(8-2-4) = 2/2 = 1.
   - The condition 4*h*n*w == N*(h*n+n*w+h*w) is true (4*2*1*1 == 2*(2*1+1*1+2*1)) (8 == 2*(2+1+2)) (8 == 2*5) (8 == 10) which is false.

2. For h=2 and w=2:
   - The condition 4*h*w-N*w-N*h is equal to 0 (4*2*2-2*2-2*2 = 16-4-4 = 8-4 = 4 which is not 0).
   - The value of n would be N*h*w/(4*h*w-N*w-N*h) = 2*2*2/(16-4-4) = 8/8 = 1.
   - The condition 4*h*n*w == N*(h*n+n*w+h*w) is true (4*2*1*2 == 2*(2*1+1*2+2*2)) (16 == 2*(2+2+4)) (16 == 2*8) (16 == 16) which is true.

Since the condition is met, the program prints the values of h, n, and w, which are 2, 1, and 2 respectively, and then terminates.
