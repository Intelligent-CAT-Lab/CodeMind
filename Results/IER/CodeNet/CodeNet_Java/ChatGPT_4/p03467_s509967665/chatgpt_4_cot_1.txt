<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "011". A HashMap `cache` is created to store intermediate results to avoid recalculating the same subproblems.

The `doit` function is called with the string "011" and the empty cache. The function checks if the string length is 0, which it is not, so it proceeds. It then checks the cache for the current string, which is also empty, so it continues.

The function calls itself recursively with the substring "11" (the original string without the first character '0'). This recursive call will continue until the base case is reached (empty string), at which point it will return 1.

The variable `woFirst` is assigned the result of `doit("11", cache)`. The variable `res` is initialized with the value of `woFirst`.

Since the first character of the original string is '0', the condition `if (s.charAt(0) == '1')` is false, and `res` is not incremented.

The for loop starts with `len = 1`. Since `len * 2 <= s.length()` is true (2 <= 3), the loop continues. A character array `cand` of length 1 is created and filled with '1'.

The inner for loop with `rep = 0` checks if `len * (rep + 1) <= s.length()`, which is true (1 <= 3). It then checks each character of the original string at positions that are multiples of `len`. Since `s.charAt(0)` is '0', `cand[0]` is set to '0'.

Since `rep` is 0, the condition `if (rep >= 1)` is false, and no further action is taken.

The for loop increments `len` to 2, but now `len * 2 <= s.length()` is false (4 <= 3), so the loop terminates.

The result `res` is then taken modulo `MODULO` (998244353), and the cache is updated with the key "011" and the value of `res`.

The final result is the value of `res`, which is the same as `woFirst` since no additional value was added to `res` in the loop.

The value of `woFirst` is the result of `doit("11", cache)`. This call will also go through a similar process, eventually breaking down to calls to `doit("1", cache)` and `doit("", cache)`, both of which will return 1. The result for `doit("11", cache)` will be 2 (since the first character is '1', it will add `woFirst` to `res`).

Therefore, the final result for `doit("011", cache)` will be 2, which is the result of `doit("11", cache)`.

The `solve` method then prints this result.
