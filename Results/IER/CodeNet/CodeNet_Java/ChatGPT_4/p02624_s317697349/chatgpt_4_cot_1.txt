The input is `4`, which is read and stored in the variable `n`. The `solve` method is called with the `inputReader` and `printWriter`.

The `spf` (Smallest Prime Factor) array and `composite` boolean array are initialized with size `n + 1` (5 in this case).

The `spf` array is initialized with `spf[1] = 1`, and then the `sieve` method is called to fill in the `spf` array for all numbers up to `n` (4 in this case).

The `sieve` method marks all composite numbers and fills the `spf` array with the smallest prime factor for each number. The loop runs from 2 to the square root of `n` (which is 2 in this case), marking multiples of each prime number as composite and setting their smallest prime factor if it hasn't been set before. After the loop, it ensures that all numbers greater than the square root of `n` and up to `n` that are not marked as composite have their `spf` set to themselves.

After the sieve is completed, the `solve` method calculates the sum of the product of each number `i` from 1 to `n` and the number of divisors of `i`. The `numDivisors` method calculates the number of divisors of `i` by repeatedly dividing `i` by its smallest prime factor until `i` becomes 1, and for each prime factor, it multiplies the result by `pow + 1`, where `pow` is the number of times the prime factor divides `i`.

The calculation for each `i` from 1 to `n` (4) is as follows:
- For `i = 1`: `numDivisors(1)` returns 1, so `ans += 1 * 1`.
- For `i = 2`: `numDivisors(2)` returns 2, so `ans += 2 * 2`.
- For `i = 3`: `numDivisors(3)` returns 2, so `ans += 3 * 2`.
- For `i = 4`: `numDivisors(4)` returns 3, as 4 is 2^2, so `ans += 4 * 3`.

The final sum `ans` is the sum of all these products, which is `1*1 + 2*2 + 3*2 + 4*3 = 1 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 23`.

The `solve` method then prints the result using `out.println(ans)`.
