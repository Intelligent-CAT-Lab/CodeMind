<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized with 2, 5, and 4 respectively according to the input. The variable M is calculated as the maximum of A, B, and C, which is 5 in this case.

The if condition checks if the sum of A, B, and C (which is 11) modulo 2 is equal to M (which is 5) modulo 2. Since 11 % 2 is 1 and 5 % 2 is also 1, the condition is true.

Therefore, the code executes the first branch of the if statement, which calculates (3*M - (A+B+C)) / 2. Substituting the values, we get (3*5 - (2+5+4)) / 2 = (15 - 11) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2.

So, the output of the code will be 2.
