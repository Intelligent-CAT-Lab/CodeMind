<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to solve a problem related to binary strings with wildcards. The input string consists of characters '0', '1', and '?', where '?' can be replaced by either '0' or '1'. The goal is to find the minimum possible value of a certain function after replacing all '?' with '0' or '1'.

The `StarrySkyTreeL` class is a segment tree implementation that supports range addition and range minimum queries. It is used to efficiently calculate the minimum value of the function as the input string is processed from right to left.

The `solve` method processes the input string character by character, starting from the rightmost character. It maintains two pointers, `O` and `Q`, which are used to track the current position in the segment tree and the range of possible positions for '?', respectively.

For each character in the input string:
- If the character is '1', the code updates the segment tree to reflect the addition of '1' to the binary string. It adjusts the pointers and updates the tree accordingly.
- If the character is '0', the code updates the segment tree to reflect the addition of '0' to the binary string. It finds the last position in the tree where the value is less than or equal to -1 and updates the tree.
- If the character is '?', the code considers both possibilities ('0' and '1') and updates the segment tree and pointers accordingly.

After processing all characters, the code finds the minimum value in the segment tree and prints it as the output.

Given the input `0??`, the code will process it as follows:
- The first character '0' will shift the `O` pointer to the right and update the segment tree.
- The next character '?' will consider both '0' and '1', update the `Q` pointer, and make the necessary changes to the segment tree.
- The last character '?' will again consider both '0' and '1', update the `Q` pointer, and make the necessary changes to the segment tree.

Finally, the code will find the minimum value in the segment tree and print it.
