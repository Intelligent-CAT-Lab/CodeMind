<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "hihi" is read and stored in the variable str. The program then creates a new string called last by replacing all occurrences of "hi" in str with an empty string using the replaceAll method. Since "hihi" consists only of the substring "hi", after the replacement, the last string becomes empty. The length of the last string is then checked. If it is 0, which it is in this case, the program prints "Yes". If it were not 0, it would print "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
