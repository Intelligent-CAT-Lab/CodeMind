<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the value 12 according to the input. The variable X is also set to the same value as N, which is 12. The variable fx is initialized with 0.

The code enters a while loop that continues as long as N is greater than or equal to 10. Inside the loop, the last digit of N is added to fx (N % 10), and then N is divided by 10 (N /= 10) to remove the last digit.

For the input 12, the while loop will execute only once because after the first iteration, N will be less than 10. In the first iteration, fx will be incremented by 2 (12 % 10), and N will be updated to 1 (12 / 10).

After the loop, fx is incremented by the current value of N, which is 1. So fx becomes 3 (2 + 1).

The code then checks if X (which is 12) is divisible by fx (which is 3). Since 12 is divisible by 3, the condition (X % fx == 0) is true.

Therefore, the program will print "Yes".
