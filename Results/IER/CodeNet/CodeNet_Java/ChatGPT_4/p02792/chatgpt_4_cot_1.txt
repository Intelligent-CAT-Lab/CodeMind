The variable n is initialized with 25 according to the input. The variable result is initialized with 0, and a 2D array named array with dimensions 10x10 is created and initialized with zeros.

The first for loop iterates from 1 to 25. For each iteration, it calculates the head (the first digit of the number) and the tail (the last digit of the number) of the integer i. It then increments the value in the array at the position [head][tail] by 1.

The second for loop also iterates from 1 to 25. For each iteration, it calculates the head and the tail of the integer i again. If the tail is 0, it continues to the next iteration without doing anything. Otherwise, it adds the value from the array at the position [tail][head] to the result.

The purpose of the code is to count the number of pairs (i, j) where the first digit of i is equal to the last digit of j and the last digit of i is equal to the first digit of j, for all 1 <= i, j <= n.

Let's calculate the array values for n = 25:
- For i = 1 to 25, the head and tail are calculated and the array is updated accordingly.
- The array will have the following non-zero values:
  - array[1][1] = 3 (for numbers 1, 11, and 21)
  - array[1][2] = 1 (for number 12)
  - array[1][3] = 1 (for number 13)
  - array[1][4] = 1 (for number 14)
  - array[1][5] = 1 (for number 15)
  - array[2][2] = 2 (for numbers 2 and 22)
  - array[2][3] = 1 (for number 23)
  - array[2][4] = 1 (for number 24)
  - array[2][5] = 1 (for number 25)
  - array[3][3] = 1 (for number 3)
  - array[4][4] = 1 (for number 4)
  - array[5][5] = 1 (for number 5)

Now, for the second loop:
- For i = 1 to 25, we add array[tail][head] to result if tail is not 0.
- The result will be incremented as follows:
  - For i = 1, result += array[1][1] (3 times)
  - For i = 2, result += array[2][2] (2 times)
  - For i = 3, result += array[3][3] (1 time)
  - For i = 4, result += array[4][4] (1 time)
  - For i = 5, result += array[5][5] (1 time)
  - For i = 11, result += array[1][1] (3 times)
  - For i = 12, result += array[2][1] (1 time)
  - For i = 13, result += array[3][1] (1 time)
  - For i = 14, result += array[4][1] (1 time)
  - For i = 15, result += array[5][1] (1 time)
  - For i = 21, result += array[1][2] (1 time)
  - For i = 22, result += array[2][2] (2 times)
  - For i = 23, result += array[3][2] (1 time)
  - For i = 24, result += array[4][2] (1 time)
  - For i = 25, result += array[5][2] (1 time)

Adding up all the increments, the final result is 17.
