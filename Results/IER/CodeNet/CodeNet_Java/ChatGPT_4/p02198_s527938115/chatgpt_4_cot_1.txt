<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, n and m, from the input. According to the given input, n is assigned the value 3 and m is assigned the value 4. The code then calculates the product of n and m by multiplying them together. The result of the multiplication, which is 3 * 4, is then printed to the standard output. Therefore, the output will be the product of 3 and 4, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
