<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and M are initialized with 1 each according to the input. The Scanner object is then closed as it is no longer needed.

The variable X is calculated as 1900 * M + 100 * (N - M). Since both N and M are 1, the calculation becomes 1900 * 1 + 100 * (1 - 1), which simplifies to 1900 + 0, resulting in X being 1900.

The variable rate is initialized with 1. A for loop is then executed, which runs from 1 to M (inclusive). Since M is 1, the loop will run only once. Inside the loop, rate is multiplied by 2. Therefore, rate becomes 1 * 2, which is 2.

Finally, the program prints the product of rate and X, which is 2 * 1900, resulting in 3800.

<<<Output>>>
3800
