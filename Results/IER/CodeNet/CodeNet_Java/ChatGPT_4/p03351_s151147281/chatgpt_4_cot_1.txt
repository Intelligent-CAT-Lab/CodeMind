<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `main` method and a class `hayami` that implements `Closeable` and is used for input parsing. The `main` method creates an instance of `hayami` and reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using the `saori_hayami` method of the `hayami` class.

The input provided is `4 7 9 3`, so `a` is set to 4, `b` to 7, `c` to 9, and `d` to 3.

The code then checks two conditions using the absolute differences between `a`, `b`, and `c`:
1. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is greater than `d` or the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is greater than `d`, it sets `flg` to `false`. Otherwise, `flg` remains `true`.
2. If `flg` is `false` from the first condition, it checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is less than or equal to `d`. If it is, `flg` is set back to `true`.

For the given input:
- `Math.abs(a - b)` is `Math.abs(4 - 7)` which is `3`. This is not greater than `d` which is `3`.
- `Math.abs(b - c)` is `Math.abs(7 - 9)` which is `2`. This is not greater than `d` which is `3`.

Since neither of the first two conditions are true, `flg` remains `true` and is not set to `false`.

Therefore, the code will print "Yes" because `flg` is `true`.

Finally, the `saori` instance is closed using the `close` method.
