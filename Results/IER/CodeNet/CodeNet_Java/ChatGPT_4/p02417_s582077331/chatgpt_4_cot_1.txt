<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two strings `low_az` and `up_az` containing the lowercase and uppercase alphabets respectively. It also initializes an empty string `str` and an integer array `cnt` of length 26 (the number of letters in the English alphabet), setting all elements to 0.

The code then creates a `Scanner` object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in).

The `while` loop reads input lines until there is no more input. For the given input "This is a pen.", the loop will execute once, reading this line into `str`.

Inside the `while` loop, there are two nested `for` loops. The outer loop iterates over each character in the input string `str`. The inner loop iterates over each character in the `low_az` and `up_az` strings.

For each character in `str`, the inner loop checks if it matches any character in `low_az` or `up_az`. If a match is found, the corresponding index in the `cnt` array is incremented. This counts the occurrences of each letter, regardless of case.

After the input is processed, the code iterates over the `cnt` array and prints the count of each letter in the format "letter : count".

For the input "This is a pen.", the counts are as follows:
- 'T' and 't' count as 1 for 't'
- 'H' and 'h' count as 1 for 'h'
- 'I' and 'i' count as 2 for 'i'
- 'S' and 's' count as 2 for 's'
- 'A' and 'a' count as 1 for 'a'
- 'P' and 'p' count as 1 for 'p'
- 'E' and 'e' count as 1 for 'e'
- 'N' and 'n' count as 1 for 'n'

All other letters have a count of 0.

Finally, the `Scanner` is closed and the program ends.
