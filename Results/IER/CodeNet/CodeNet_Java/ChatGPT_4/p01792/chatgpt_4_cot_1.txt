<<<Analysis>>>
The input `60 2 3` initializes the variables p, m, and n with the values 60, 2, and 3 respectively. The Casino object is created with the debug flag set to false.

The `printProb` method of the Casino class is called with these values. Since p is 60, which is greater than 50 but not equal to 0, 50, or 100, the `else if (p > 50)` block is executed.

Inside this block, the `getProbLarge` method is called with the values 0.6 (60/100), 2, and 3. The `getProbLarge` method calculates the probability of reaching the goal n starting from m when the probability of winning each bet is greater than 50%. Since m is 2 and n is 3, the method will calculate the probability of going from 2 to 3 with a winning probability of 60%.

The `getProbLarge` method initializes an array f to store the probabilities of going from i to i+1. It starts with f[0] = 0 and calculates each subsequent f[i] using the formula f[i] = p / (1 - pf * f[i - 1]). Since n is 3, the loop will run for i = 1 and i = 2. The result is the product of f[2] and f[1].

After calculating the probabilities, the method returns the result, which is the probability of reaching 3 from 2 with a winning chance of 60% for each bet.

The `printProb` method then prints the result of `getProbLarge` and prints "1" twice, which represents the best bet in this scenario (betting 1 each time).

The output will be the probability calculated by `getProbLarge` followed by "1" on two separate lines.
