<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate the expected number of minutes required to solve N problems, with M problems requiring a compilation time of 1900 minutes due to the possibility of a compile error, and the remaining N-M problems requiring a compilation time of 100 minutes with no possibility of a compile error. The probability of a compile error is 50% for each of the M problems.

Given the input `1 1`, the variables N and M are both set to 1. The variable c is calculated as 1900.0 * 1 + 100.0 * (1 - 1), which simplifies to 1900.0. The variable p is initialized to 1.0 and is then multiplied by 0.5 for each of the M problems, resulting in p = 0.5. The variable q is initialized to 1.0.

The code then enters a loop that runs for a very large number of iterations (up to 2,999,999). In each iteration, it calculates a partial expected value by multiplying the iteration number (i), the cost per problem (c), the probability of reaching that iteration (p), and the probability of not having finished in the previous iterations (q). After each iteration, it updates the probability q by multiplying it by (1 - p), which is the probability of not solving the problem in that iteration.

Since the input is `1 1`, the loop will effectively calculate the expected number of minutes to solve one problem that has a 50% chance of requiring 1900 minutes to solve due to a compile error. The expected number of minutes is the sum of the expected values for each iteration.

The loop is designed to run until the change in the expected value is negligible (less than eps, which is set to 0.0000001). Once the loop completes, the final expected value is stored in the variable res.

The code then adds a small epsilon value to res to avoid issues with floating-point arithmetic when casting to an integer. It then casts the result to an integer using Math.floor to round down to the nearest integer and prints the result.

Given the input `1 1`, the expected number of minutes is 3800, which is the sum of 1900 minutes for the 50% chance that the problem requires a recompile and 1900 minutes for the 50% chance that it compiles successfully on the first try.

3800
