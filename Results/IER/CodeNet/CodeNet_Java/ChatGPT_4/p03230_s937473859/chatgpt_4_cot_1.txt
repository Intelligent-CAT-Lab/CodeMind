<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check if there is an integer i such that the sum of the first i natural numbers (i.e., i * (i + 1) / 2) equals n.

In the first iteration, i is 1, and the sum is 1 * (1 + 1) / 2 = 1, which is not equal to 3.
In the second iteration, i is 2, and the sum is 2 * (2 + 1) / 2 = 3, which is equal to n.

Since the condition is met, it prints "Yes" and then prints the value of i + 1, which is 3.
Next, it initializes a 2D array with dimensions (i + 1) x i, which in this case is a 3x2 array.

It then enters a nested loop to fill the array. The outer loop runs from j = 0 to j = i (inclusive), and the inner loop runs from k = j to k = i - 1 (inclusive). The variable a starts at 1 and increments with each assignment. The array is filled in such a way that array[j][k] and array[k + 1][j] are set to the same value of a.

After filling the array, another nested loop is used to print the array. The outer loop runs from j = 0 to j = i (inclusive), and the inner loop runs from k = 0 to k = i - 1 (inclusive). Before printing the array values, it prints the value of i followed by a space.

The expected array to be printed is:
```
1 2
3 1
2 3
```
However, the array is printed with the value of i (which is 2) at the beginning of each row, followed by the array values. So the actual output will be:
```
2 1 2 
2 3 1 
2 2 3 
```
After printing the array, the program returns, so it does not print "No".
