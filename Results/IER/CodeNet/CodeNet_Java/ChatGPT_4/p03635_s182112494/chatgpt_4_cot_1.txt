<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using a Scanner object. The input provided is `3 4`.
The first integer read is `3`, and the second integer read is `4`.
The code then calculates the expression `(sc.nextInt()-1)*(sc.nextInt()-1)`, which translates to `(3-1)*(4-1)` after substituting the input values.
This simplifies to `2*3`, which equals `6`.
Finally, the code prints the result of the calculation, which is `6`.
<<<Output>>>
6
