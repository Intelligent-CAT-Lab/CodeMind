<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 100 according to the input. The array a is initialized with the values {25, 10, 5, 1}, representing coin denominations. The variable count is initialized with 0.

The code enters a for loop that iterates over the array a. In each iteration, it checks if n is not 0. If n is not 0, it performs two operations:
1. It adds to count the result of the integer division of n by the current coin denomination a[i].
2. It updates n to be the remainder of the division of n by the current coin denomination a[i].

The loop iterates over the denominations in the following order: 25, 10, 5, 1.

For the input 100, the following operations occur:
- In the first iteration (i=0), n is 100 and a[i] is 25. The division 100 / 25 equals 4, so count is increased by 4 and n becomes 100 % 25, which is 0.
- Since n is now 0, the if condition will not be true for the remaining iterations, and the loop will complete without further changes to count.

After the loop finishes, the final value of count, which is 4, is printed as the output.
