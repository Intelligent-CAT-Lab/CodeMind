<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three integers N, A, and B with the values 10, 3, and 5 respectively according to the input. It then prints two values separated by a space:
1. The minimum of A and B, which is the minimum of 3 and 5, so it prints 3.
2. The maximum of 0 and (A + B - N), which is the maximum of 0 and (3 + 5 - 10), so it prints the maximum of 0 and -2, which is 0.

The output is therefore the minimum of A and B followed by the maximum of 0 and (A + B - N).
<<<Output>>>
