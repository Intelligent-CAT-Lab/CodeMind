<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input, which are assigned to variables a and b with the values 30 and 100 respectively. It then checks the value of a with a series of if-else statements:
- If a is less than or equal to 5, it prints 0.
- Else if a is less than or equal to 12, it prints half of b (cast to an integer).
- Else, it prints the value of b.

Since the value of a is 30, which is greater than 12, the code will execute the last else block and print the value of b, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
