<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two integer variables, int1 and int2, with the values 3 and 4 respectively according to the input. The commented lines are ignored as they are not executed. The variable temp_int1 is initialized but not used in the code. The variable ans_int is initialized to 0 and the String variable ans is initialized but not used in the code.

The code then calculates the value of ans_int by subtracting 1 from both int1 and int2, and then multiplying the results. This calculation is (3-1) * (4-1), which equals 2 * 3, resulting in 6.

A PrintWriter object is created to write the output to the system output stream. The value of ans_int, which is 6, is printed to the console. The PrintWriter is then flushed to ensure the output is written out immediately. Finally, the Scanner object is closed.
