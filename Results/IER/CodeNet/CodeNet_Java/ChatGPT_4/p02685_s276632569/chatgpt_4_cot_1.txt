<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3 2 1`, which corresponds to the variables N, M, and K respectively. The code is designed to calculate a certain mathematical expression involving combinations and modular exponentiation, and then output the result.

The code initializes the combination utility with `COMinit()`, which precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to a certain limit defined by `MAX`.

The main calculation is done in a loop that iterates from `k=0` to `k=K` (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates a temporary value `tmp` as follows:
1. `tmp` is initialized to 1.
2. It multiplies `tmp` by the combination of (N-1) choose k, modulo MOD (`COM(N-1,k)%MOD`).
3. It then multiplies `tmp` by `modPow(M-1, N-1-k, MOD)%MOD`, which is the modular exponentiation of (M-1) to the power of (N-1-k), modulo MOD.
4. The result is then added to the accumulator `ans`, which is also taken modulo MOD.

After the loop, the final answer is multiplied by M and taken modulo MOD once more. The result is then printed.

Given the input `3 2 1`, the loop will run for k=0 and k=1. The MOD value is a constant `998244353`.

Let's calculate the output step by step:
- For k=0:
  - `tmp = COM(2, 0) % MOD = 1 % MOD = 1`
  - `tmp *= modPow(1, 2, MOD) % MOD = 1 % MOD = 1`
  - `ans += tmp % MOD = 1`
- For k=1:
  - `tmp = COM(2, 1) % MOD = 2 % MOD = 2`
  - `tmp *= modPow(1, 1, MOD) % MOD = 1 % MOD = 1`
  - `ans += tmp % MOD = (1 + 2) % MOD = 3`

Finally, the answer is multiplied by M and taken modulo MOD:
- `ans *= M % MOD = 3 * 2 % MOD = 6`

Therefore, the output of the code should be `6`.
