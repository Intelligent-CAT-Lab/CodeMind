<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value N from the input, which is 3 in this case.

The variable total is initialized to 0. A for loop is set up to run from i = 1 to i = N (inclusive). In each iteration, the current value of i is added to the total. The loop runs three times with i taking the values 1, 2, and 3.

In the first iteration, i = 1, so total becomes 0 + 1 = 1.
In the second iteration, i = 2, so total becomes 1 + 2 = 3.
In the third iteration, i = 3, so total becomes 3 + 3 = 6.

After the loop finishes, the final value of total, which is 6, is printed to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
6
