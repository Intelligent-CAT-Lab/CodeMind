<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "3776". The boolean variable `flag` is set to true initially.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 2 (inclusive) to check each pair of adjacent characters in the string `s`.
In the first iteration (i=0), it checks if the substring from index 0 to 1 ("3") is equal to the substring from index 1 to 2 ("7"). They are not equal, so `flag` remains true.
In the second iteration (i=1), it checks if the substring from index 1 to 2 ("7") is equal to the substring from index 2 to 3 ("7"). They are equal, so `flag` is set to false.
In the third iteration (i=2), it checks if the substring from index 2 to 3 ("7") is equal to the substring from index 3 to 4 ("6"). They are not equal, but `flag` is already false from the previous iteration.
After the loop, the program checks the value of `flag`. Since `flag` is false, it prints "Bad".
