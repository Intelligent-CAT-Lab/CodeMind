<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable n. The input provided is `1`, so n is set to 1.

Next, the code checks if n is equal to 0 using an if statement. Since n is 1, the condition n==0 is false. Therefore, the else block is executed, and the code prints "0" to the standard output.

The program does not have any other statements or loops, so after printing "0", the program will terminate.
<<<Output>>>
0
