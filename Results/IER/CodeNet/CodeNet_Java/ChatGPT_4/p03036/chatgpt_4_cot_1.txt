<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to simulate the growth of algae based on the formula `x = r * x - d`, where `r` and `d` are constants, and `x` is the initial state of the algae. The simulation runs for 10 iterations.

The variables `r`, `d`, and `x` are initialized with the values 2, 10, and 20 respectively according to the input.

The for loop runs 10 times, and in each iteration, it updates the value of `x` using the formula `x = r * x - d`. The updated value of `x` is then printed out.

Let's calculate the value of `x` for each iteration:
1. x = 2 * 20 - 10 = 40 - 10 = 30
2. x = 2 * 30 - 10 = 60 - 10 = 50
3. x = 2 * 50 - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90
4. x = 2 * 90 - 10 = 180 - 10 = 170
5. x = 2 * 170 - 10 = 340 - 10 = 330
6. x = 2 * 330 - 10 = 660 - 10 = 650
7. x = 2 * 650 - 10 = 1300 - 10 = 1290
8. x = 2 * 1290 - 10 = 2580 - 10 = 2570
9. x = 2 * 2570 - 10 = 5140 - 10 = 5130
10. x = 2 * 5130 - 10 = 10260 - 10 = 10250

These values are printed out one per line.
