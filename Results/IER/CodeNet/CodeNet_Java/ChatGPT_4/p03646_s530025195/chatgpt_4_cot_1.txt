<<<Analysis>>>
The input K is initialized with 0. The constant N is set to 50.

The solve function is called with the value of K, which is 0.

Inside the solve function, an array a of length N (50) is created and filled with the value N - 1 + K / N. Since K is 0, K / N is 0, so each element in the array a is initialized to N - 1, which is 49.

Next, the code enters a loop that runs K % N times. Since K is 0, K % N is also 0, so the loop does not execute at all.

The function then returns a formatted string that contains the length of the array a and the elements of the array a joined by spaces. The length of the array is 50, and since the loop did not execute, the elements of the array are all still 49.

Therefore, the output will be "50" followed by a newline, and then 50 occurrences of "49" separated by spaces.
