The variables X and Y are initialized with 3 and 20 respectively according to the input. The variable i is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop that continues as long as X is less than or equal to Y.
Inside the while loop, i is incremented by 1, and X is doubled (multiplied by 2).
The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: X = 3 * 2 = 6, i = 1
- Second iteration: X = 6 * 2 = 12, i = 2
- Third iteration: X = 12 * 2 = 24, i = 3
Now X (24) is greater than Y (20), so the loop terminates.
The final value of i, which is 3, is printed as the output.
