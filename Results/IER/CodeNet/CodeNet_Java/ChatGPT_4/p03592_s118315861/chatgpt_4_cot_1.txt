<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to read three integers N, M, and K from the input, which are 2, 2, and 2 respectively in this case. It then initializes a 2D array `b` of size N by M, which is 2 by 2, and fills it with the value 1.

The main part of the code is a nested loop that iterates over all possible combinations of i (from 0 to N inclusive) and k (from 0 to M inclusive). For each combination, it checks if the equation `K == (M * i + N * k - 2 * i * k)` holds true. If it finds a combination where this equation is true, it prints "Yes" and exits the program.

Let's analyze the equation for the given input values (N = 2, M = 2, K = 2):

For i = 0 and k = 0:
K == (2 * 0 + 2 * 0 - 2 * 0 * 0) => 2 == 0 (false)

For i = 0 and k = 1:
K == (2 * 0 + 2 * 1 - 2 * 0 * 1) => 2 == 2 (true)

Since the equation holds true for i = 0 and k = 1, the program will print "Yes" and terminate without checking further combinations.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
