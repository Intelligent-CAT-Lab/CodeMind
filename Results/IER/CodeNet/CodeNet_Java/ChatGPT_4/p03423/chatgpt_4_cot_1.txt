<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a single number '8'. The BufferedReader reads this input and the StringTokenizer is used to tokenize the input string. Since there is only one token, it is the number '8'. This token is then parsed into an integer using Integer.parseInt(). The parsed integer is then divided by 3 using integer division, which results in 2 because integer division truncates the decimal part. The Math.floor() function is redundant here because the result of the integer division is already a whole number. Finally, the result, which is 2, is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
2
