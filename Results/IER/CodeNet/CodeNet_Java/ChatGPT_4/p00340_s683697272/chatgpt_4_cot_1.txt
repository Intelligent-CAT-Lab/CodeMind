<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads four integers a, b, c, and d from the input, which are 1, 1, 3, and 4 respectively according to the given input.

The code then checks if any two pairs of these integers are equal. It does this by checking three conditions using logical OR (||) operators:
1. a == b && c == d
2. a == c && b == d
3. a == d && b == c

For the given input, the first condition (a == b && c == d) is evaluated as follows:
- a == b is true because 1 == 1.
- c == d is false because 3 != 4.

Since the first condition involves an AND (&&) operator, the entire condition is false because one of the operands is false.

The second condition (a == c && b == d) is evaluated as follows:
- a == c is false because 1 != 3.
- b == d is false because 1 != 4.

Again, since both operands are false, the entire condition is false.

The third condition (a == d && b == c) is evaluated as follows:
- a == d is false because 1 != 4.
- b == c is false because 1 != 3.

Once again, both operands are false, so the entire condition is false.

Since all three conditions are false, the code will execute the else block and print "no".
