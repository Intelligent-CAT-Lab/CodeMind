The input provided is `11 2`, which means N is 11 and K is 2.

The `solve` method is called, which initializes N with 11 and K with 2.

The variable `base` is initialized with 1 and `cnt` with 0.

A while loop is used to determine how many times the number K can be multiplied by itself before it exceeds N.

The loop runs as follows:
1. `base` is 1, which is less than or equal to N (11), so `cnt` is incremented to 1 and `base` is updated to `base * K` which is 2.
2. `base` is now 2, which is still less than or equal to N (11), so `cnt` is incremented to 2 and `base` is updated to `base * K` which is 4.
3. `base` is now 4, which is still less than or equal to N (11), so `cnt` is incremented to 3 and `base` is updated to `base * K` which is 8.
4. `base` is now 8, which is still less than or equal to N (11), so `cnt` is incremented to 4 and `base` is updated to `base * K` which is 16.
5. `base` is now 16, which is greater than N (11), so the loop ends.

The final value of `cnt` is 4, which is the number of times 2 can be multiplied by itself before it exceeds 11.

The `out.println(cnt)` statement prints the value of `cnt` to the standard output.
