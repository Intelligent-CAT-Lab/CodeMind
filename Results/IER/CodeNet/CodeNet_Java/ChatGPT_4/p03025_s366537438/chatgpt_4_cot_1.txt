<<<Analysis>>>
The input values are N=1, A=25, B=25, and C=50. The MOD value is a constant set to 1e9 + 7, which is 1000000007.

The solve method calculates the probabilities of A winning (Awin) and B winning (Bwin) using the modpow method to find the modular inverse of (A + B) and then multiplying by A and B respectively.

The num variable is calculated as the product of (A + B + C) and the modular inverse of (A + B), modulo MOD.

The ret variable is initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate the result.

The for loop iterates from i=0 to i=N-1, which in this case is just one iteration since N=1.

Inside the loop, the ret variable is updated twice, once for the case where A wins and once for the case where B wins. The comb method is used to calculate the binomial coefficient (combination), and modpow is used to calculate the powers of Awin and Bwin.

The comb method initializes the xs and ys arrays if they haven't been initialized before. xs[i] contains i! modulo MOD, and ys[i] contains the modular inverse of i! modulo MOD.

After the loop, the final result is calculated by multiplying ret by num and taking the result modulo MOD.

The out.println statement prints the final result.

Given that N=1, the loop will only run once, and the calculations will be relatively straightforward. The comb method will calculate comb(1, 0), which is 1, and the modpow method will calculate the powers of Awin and Bwin, which will be Awin^1 and Bwin^0 (which is 1) for the first addition to ret, and Bwin^1 and Awin^0 (which is 1) for the second addition to ret.

Finally, the result is printed out.
