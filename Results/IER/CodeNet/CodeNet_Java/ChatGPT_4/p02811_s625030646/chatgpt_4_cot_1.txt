<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input. The first integer is multiplied by 500 and assigned to the variable `coins`. The second integer is read directly from the input.

Given the input `2 900`, the first integer `2` is multiplied by 500, resulting in `coins` being equal to 1000. The second integer `900` is read and compared to `coins`.

The if statement checks if `coins` (which is 1000) is greater than or equal to 900. Since 1000 is indeed greater than 900, the condition is true.

Therefore, the code will print "Yes" as the output because the condition of the if statement is satisfied.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
