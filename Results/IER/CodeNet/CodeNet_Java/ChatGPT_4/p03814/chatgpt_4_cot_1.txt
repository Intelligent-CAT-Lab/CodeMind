The input string is "QWERTYASDFZXCV". The length of the string (n) is 14.

The code initializes two integer variables, from and to, which are used to find the positions of the first 'A' and the last 'Z' in the string, respectively.

The first for loop starts from the beginning of the string and looks for the first occurrence of the character 'A'. It finds 'A' at index 6 (0-based index), so from is set to 6.

The second for loop starts from the end of the string and looks for the last occurrence of the character 'Z'. It finds 'Z' at index 11 (0-based index), so to is set to 11.

The code then calculates the length of the substring from the first 'A' to the last 'Z' by subtracting from from to and adding 1. This results in 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.

The output is the length of this substring, which is 6.
