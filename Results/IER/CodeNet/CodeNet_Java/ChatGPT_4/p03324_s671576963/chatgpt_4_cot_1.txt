<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input. The input provided is `0 5`, so a is initialized with 0 and b with 5.

The code then checks if b is equal to 100. If it is, b is set to 101. However, in this case, b is 5, so this condition is not met and b remains 5.

Next, the code checks the value of a. If a is 0, it prints the value of b. Since a is indeed 0 in this case, the code will execute the line `System.out.println(b);` and print the value of b, which is 5.

The else if and else blocks are not executed because the condition for the if block is met.

<<<Output>>>
5
