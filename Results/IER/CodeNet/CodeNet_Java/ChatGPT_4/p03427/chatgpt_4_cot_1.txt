<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads a long integer value from the input and stores it in the variable N, adding 1 to it immediately.

Given the input `100`, the value of N becomes `101`.

The Scanner is then closed as it is no longer needed.

The code converts the value of N to a String and stores it in the variable s. The length of this string is then calculated, which represents the number of digits in N. For the input `101`, the length is `3`.

The first digit of the string s is extracted using substring and converted back to an integer, which is stored in the variable c. For `101`, c is `1`.

The code then calculates the variable max, which is the sum of the first digit minus one (`c - 1`) and nine times the number of remaining digits (`9 * (length - 1)`). For `101`, this calculation is `(1 - 1) + 9 * (3 - 1)`, which simplifies to `0 + 9 * 2`, resulting in `18`.

Finally, the code prints out the value of max.
