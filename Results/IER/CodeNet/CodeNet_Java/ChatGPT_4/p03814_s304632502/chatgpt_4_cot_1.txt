<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "QWERTYASDFZXCV". The variable `A` is initialized with the index of the first occurrence of 'A' in the string, which is 6 (0-based index).
The variable `Z` is initialized with 0, and a for loop is used to iterate over the characters of the string. The loop updates the value of `Z` to the index of the last occurrence of 'Z' in the string. The character 'Z' is found at index 11.
After the loop, the program calculates `Z - A + 1`, which is `11 - 6 + 1 = 6`.
The output is the length of the substring from the first 'A' to the last 'Z' in the string, which is 6 characters long.
