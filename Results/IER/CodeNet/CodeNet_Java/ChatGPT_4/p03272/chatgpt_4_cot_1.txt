The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two integers, N and K, from the input. According to the given input, N is assigned the value 4 and K is assigned the value 2.

The code then calculates the expression N-K+1, which is 4-2+1, and the result is 3.

Finally, the code prints the result of the calculation, which is 3.
