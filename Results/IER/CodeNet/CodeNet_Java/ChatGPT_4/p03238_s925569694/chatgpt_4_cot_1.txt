<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by reading an integer from the input, which is assigned to the variable `n`. Since the input is `1`, `n` is set to `1`.
Next, the code initializes two variables `a` and `b` to `0`.
The code then checks if `n` is equal to `2`. If it is, it would read two more integers from the input and assign them to `a` and `b`. However, since `n` is `1`, this block is skipped.
Finally, the code prints the result of a ternary operator. The condition of the ternary operator checks if `n` is equal to `1`. Since `n` is indeed `1`, the ternary operator evaluates to the string "Hello World", which is then printed to the output.
<<<Output>>>
Hello World
