<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method and a nested `FastScanner` class for fast input reading. The `main` method creates an instance of `FastScanner` and reads three integers: `w`, `a`, and `b`.

The input values are:
- `w` = 3
- `a` = 2
- `b` = 6

The `FastScanner` class is used to read these values efficiently from the standard input stream.

The code then checks the relative positions of two ranges defined by the values of `a`, `b`, and `w`. The first range is from `a` to `a+w` and the second range is from `b` to `b+w`.

The conditions checked are as follows:
1. If `a` is less than or equal to `b` and `b` is less than or equal to `a+w`, it means the two ranges overlap or touch, and the output should be 0.
2. If `a` is less than or equal to `b+w` and `b+w` is less than or equal to `a+w`, it also means the two ranges overlap or touch, and the output should be 0.
3. If `a+w` is less than `b`, it means there is a gap between the two ranges, and the output should be the distance between `b` and the end of the first range, which is `b-a-w`.
4. Otherwise, the gap is between `a` and the end of the second range, and the output should be `a-b-w`.

Given the input values, the first range is from 2 to 5 (2+3), and the second range is from 6 to 9 (6+3). Since `a+w` (which is 5) is less than `b` (which is 6), the third condition is true, and the output should be the distance between `b` and the end of the first range, which is `b-a-w` = `6-2-3` = `1`.
