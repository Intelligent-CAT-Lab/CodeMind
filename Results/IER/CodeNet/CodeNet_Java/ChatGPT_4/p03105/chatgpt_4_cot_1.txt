<<<Analysis>>>
The Scanner object `entrada` is used to read three integers from the input. The variables A, B, and C are initialized with the values 2, 11, and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable N is calculated by dividing B by A, which results in 11 / 2 = 5 (since N is an integer, the result is truncated).
The if statement checks if N is greater than C. Since N is 5 and C is 4, the condition is true.
Therefore, the program prints the value of C, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
