<<<Analysis>>>
The input "0 0 1 1" is read and split into an array of strings ["0", "0", "1", "1"]. A double array `list` of size 4 is created to store these values as doubles.

The while loop runs 4 times (since n starts at 4 and decrements to 0), parsing each string in the `lines` array to a double and storing it in the corresponding index of the `list` array. After the loop, `list` contains the values [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0].

The program then calculates the distance between the points (0,0) and (1,1) using the distance formula: sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2), which in this case is sqrt((1 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2).

The output is the result of this calculation, which is the square root of 2.
