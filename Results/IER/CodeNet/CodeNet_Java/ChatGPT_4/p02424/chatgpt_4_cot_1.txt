<<<Analysis>>>
The input values are 8 and 10, which are assigned to long variables a and b respectively. The program then performs bitwise operations on these two numbers and prints the results as binary strings.

First, it calculates the bitwise AND of a and b (8 & 10). The binary representation of 8 is 1000 and of 10 is 1010. The bitwise AND operation results in 1000, which is 8 in decimal.

Second, it calculates the bitwise OR of a and b (8 | 10). The binary representation of 8 is 1000 and of 10 is 1010. The bitwise OR operation results in 1010, which is 10 in decimal.

Third, it calculates the bitwise XOR of a and b (8 ^ 10). The binary representation of 8 is 1000 and of 10 is 1010. The bitwise XOR operation results in 0010, which is 2 in decimal.

The toString method converts these decimal results back into a 32-bit binary string. The method constructs a StringBuilder, then iterates 32 times, each time appending the least significant bit of the number (x % 2) and then dividing the number by 2 (x /= 2). After the loop, it reverses the StringBuilder to get the binary representation in the correct order.

For the number 8 (1000 in binary), the 32-bit binary string will be "00000000000000000000000000001000".
For the number 10 (1010 in binary), the 32-bit binary string will be "00000000000000000000000000001010".
For the number 2 (0010 in binary), the 32-bit binary string will be "00000000000000000000000000000010".

These strings are then printed as the output of the program.
