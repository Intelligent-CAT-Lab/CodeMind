The variables H1, M1, H2, M2, and K are initialized with 10, 0, 15, 0, and 30 respectively according to the input.
The code calculates the difference in time between two moments (H1:M1 and H2:M2) in minutes and then subtracts K from this difference.
The difference in hours is calculated as (H2 - H1) which is (15 - 10) = 5 hours.
The difference in minutes is calculated as (M2 - M1) which is (0 - 0) = 0 minutes.
The total difference in time is (5 * 60) + 0 = 300 minutes.
Then, K (which is 30) is subtracted from this total difference, resulting in 300 - 30 = 270 minutes.
The final answer, which is the total difference in time minus K, is printed as the output.
<<<Output>>>
270
