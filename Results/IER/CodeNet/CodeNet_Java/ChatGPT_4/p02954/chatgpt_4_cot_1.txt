The input string S is initialized with "RRLRL". The length of S, N, is 5. An integer array ans of size N is created to store the final results.

The variable curIndex is initialized to 0 and is used to iterate over the characters of the string S.

The first while loop starts and counts the number of 'R' characters until it encounters a character that is not 'R'. It finds 2 'R' characters, so numRight is set to 2, and curIndex is now 2.

The second while loop starts and counts the number of 'L' characters until it encounters a character that is not 'L'. It finds 1 'L' character, so numLeft is set to 1, and curIndex is now 3.

The variable R is set to curIndex - 1, which is 2 - 1 = 1.

The if condition checks if the sum of left and right is even. Since 1 + 2 = 3 is odd, it goes to the else block.

In the else block, since numRight is odd, right is set to the integer division of sum / 2, which is 3 / 2 = 1. Then left is set to sum - right, which is 3 - 1 = 2.

The values of left and right are assigned to ans[R] and ans[R+1], which are ans[1] and ans[2]. So ans[1] is set to 2, and ans[2] is set to 1.

The if condition checks if curIndex is N - 1, which is not true since curIndex is 3 and N - 1 is 4.

The first while loop starts again and counts the number of 'R' characters. It finds 1 'R' character, so numRight is set to 1, and curIndex is now 4.

The second while loop starts and counts the number of 'L' characters. It finds 1 'L' character, so numLeft is set to 1, and curIndex is now 5.

The variable R is set to curIndex - 1, which is 4 - 1 = 3.

The if condition checks if the sum of left and right is even. Since 1 + 1 = 2 is even, it goes to the if block.

In the if block, the sum of left and right is divided by 2, so left and right are both set to 1.

The values of left and right are assigned to ans[R] and ans[R+1], which are ans[3] and ans[4]. So ans[3] is set to 1, and ans[4] is set to 1.

The if condition checks if curIndex is N - 1, which is true since curIndex is 5 and N - 1 is 4. The loop breaks.

The final array ans is [0, 2, 1, 1, 1], as the first element was never updated and remains 0.

The for loop prints out the elements of ans separated by spaces.
