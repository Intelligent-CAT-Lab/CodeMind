<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `ans` with five elements, all set to 1. It also initializes a `count` variable to 0. The code then enters a while loop that reads integers from the input using a Scanner object until five integers have been read.

As each integer is read, it is stored in the `ans` array at the index specified by `count`, and `count` is incremented. Once `count` reaches 5, indicating that five integers have been read, the `strkn` method is called with the `ans` array as an argument.

The `strkn` method sorts the `ans` array in reverse order using `Arrays.sort` with a `Comparator.reverseOrder()`. After sorting, the method constructs a string `result` by concatenating the elements of the sorted array with spaces in between.

Given the input `3 6 9 7 5`, the `ans` array will be updated to `{3, 6, 9, 7, 5}`. After sorting in reverse order, the array will be `{9, 7, 6, 5, 3}`. The `strkn` method will then return the string `"9 7 6 5 3"`.

Finally, the main method prints the result returned by `strkn`, which is the sorted array in string format.
