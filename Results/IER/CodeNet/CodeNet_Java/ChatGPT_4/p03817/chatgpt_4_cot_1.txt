The input is a single long integer `7`. The Scanner class reads this input and assigns it to the variable `x`.

The main calculation is done in the following line:
`long ans = x / 11 * 2 + x % 11 / 7 + Math.min(x % 11, 1);`

Let's break down the calculation step by step:
1. `x / 11 * 2` calculates how many complete sets of 11 are in the number `x` and multiplies that by 2. Since `7 / 11` is 0 (integer division), this part of the expression evaluates to 0.
2. `x % 11 / 7` calculates the remainder of `x` divided by 11, which is then divided by 7. Since `7 % 11` is 7 and `7 / 7` is 1, this part of the expression evaluates to 1.
3. `Math.min(x % 11, 1)` takes the minimum of the remainder of `x` divided by 11 and 1. Since `7 % 11` is 7, the minimum is 1.

Adding these parts together, we get `0 + 1 + 1`, which equals 2.

Therefore, the output of the code will be `2`.
