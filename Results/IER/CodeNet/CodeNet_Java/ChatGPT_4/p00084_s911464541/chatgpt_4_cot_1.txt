<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "Rain, rain, go to Spain." is read and split into an array of strings using the regex pattern "[,. ]" which matches commas, periods, and spaces. This results in the array arr containing the following elements: ["Rain", "", "rain", "", "go", "to", "", "Spain", ""].

The StringBuilder sb is used to build the output string. The for-each loop iterates over each element of the array arr. The if condition checks if the length of the string s is greater than 2 and less than 7. If the condition is true, the string s is appended to sb followed by a space.

The strings "Rain", "rain", and "Spain" have lengths greater than 2 and less than 7, so they are appended to sb. The strings "go" and "to" have lengths less than or equal to 2, so they are not appended.

After the loop, the StringBuilder sb contains "Rain rain Spain ". The trim() method is called to remove any leading or trailing spaces, and the resulting string is printed.

<<<Output>>>
Rain rain Spain
