<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads three strings, a, b, and c, from the input. According to the given input, the values of a, b, and c are "AtCoder", "Beginner", and "Contest" respectively.

The code then creates a new string, ans, by concatenating the first character of each of these strings. It does this by using the substring method of the String class, which returns a new string that is a substring of the original string. The substring method is called with the arguments 0 and 1, which means it will return the substring starting at index 0 and ending before index 1, effectively returning the first character of the string.

The first character of "AtCoder" is 'A', the first character of "Beginner" is 'B', and the first character of "Contest" is 'C'. Therefore, the concatenation of these characters will result in the string "ABC".

Finally, the code prints the value of ans to the standard output.

ABC
