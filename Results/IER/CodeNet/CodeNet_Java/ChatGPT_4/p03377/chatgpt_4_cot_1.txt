<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads three integers a, b, and x from the input, which are 3, 5, and 4 respectively according to the given input.

The if statement checks whether the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to x and whether a is less than or equal to x. For the given input, the sum of a and b is 3 + 5 = 8, which is greater than x (4), and a (3) is less than x (4). Since both conditions are true, the if block will execute, and the program will print "YES".

If either of the conditions were false, the else block would execute, and the program would print "NO".

<<<Output>>>
YES
