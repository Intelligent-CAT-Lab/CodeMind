<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two integers, n and k, from the input and assigns them the values 3 and 2 respectively according to the given input. The Scanner is then closed as it is no longer needed.

The main method then prints the result of a ternary operation. The condition of the ternary operation checks if k is equal to 1. If k is equal to 1, it will print 0; otherwise, it will print the result of the expression n - k.

In this case, since k is not equal to 1 (k is 2), the ternary operation will evaluate to the else part, which is n - k. Therefore, it will calculate 3 - 2, which equals 1.

The methods arrayInt, arrayLong, and arrayDouble are not called in the main method, so they do not affect the output.
