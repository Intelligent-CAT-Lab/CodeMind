<<<Analysis>>>
The input "3 8 1" is read as a single string and then split into an array of strings ["3", "8", "1"] using the split method.
The array is then sorted using Arrays.sort, which sorts the array in ascending order, resulting in the array ["1", "3", "8"].
The sorted array elements are then parsed into integers and assigned to intNumSmall, intNumMiddle, and intNumlarge respectively, with intNumSmall being the smallest number (1), intNumMiddle being the middle number (3), and intNumlarge being the largest number (8).
Finally, the program prints out the sorted numbers in ascending order, separated by spaces.
<<<Output>>>
1 3 8
