<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the double variable L. The input provided is `3`, so L is set to 3.0 (since it's a double).

The Scanner is then closed as it's no longer needed.

The code proceeds to calculate the cube of one third of L, which is (L/3)^3. Since L is 3, (L/3) is 1.0, and the cube of 1.0 is 1.0.

Finally, the result of the calculation, which is 1.0, is printed to the console.

<<<Output>>>
1.0
