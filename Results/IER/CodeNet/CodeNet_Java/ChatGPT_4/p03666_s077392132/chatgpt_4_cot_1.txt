<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided initializes the variables n, a, b, c, and d with the values 5, 1, 5, 2, and 4 respectively.

The variable diff is calculated as the absolute difference between a and b, which is |1 - 5| = 4.

The boolean variable isOK is initialized as false.

A for loop is executed with the variable i ranging from 0 to n-2 (since n is 5, i will range from 0 to 3).

Inside the loop, two variables dw and up are calculated for each iteration of i:
- dw is calculated as c * (n-1-i) - d * i.
- up is calculated as -c * i + d * (n-1-i).

The loop checks if the value of diff lies between dw and up (inclusive). If it does, isOK is set to true and the loop breaks.

Let's calculate dw and up for each iteration of i:

For i = 0:
dw = 2 * (5-1-0) - 4 * 0 = 8
up = -2 * 0 + 4 * (5-1-0) = 16
Since diff (4) is between dw (8) and up (16), isOK is set to true and the loop breaks.

Since isOK is true, the output will be "YES".
