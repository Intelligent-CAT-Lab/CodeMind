<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to generate and print all the combinations of n binary digits where exactly k bits are set to 1. The input `5 3` means that n is 5 and k is 3.

The code uses a for loop to iterate through all possible combinations of 5 binary digits (from 0 to 2^5 - 1, which is 0 to 31). For each number i in this range, it creates an array `bitArray` of size n (5 in this case) to represent the binary digits of i.

Inside the loop, another variable `temp` is used to manipulate the value of i without changing i itself. A nested for loop is used to convert the number `temp` into its binary representation and store it in `bitArray`. The least significant bit is stored at the beginning of the array (index 0). The variable `count` is used to keep track of the number of bits set to 1.

After the binary representation is obtained, the code checks if the number of bits set to 1 (`count`) is equal to k (3 in this case). If it is, the code prints the decimal number i followed by a colon and then the indices of the bits that are set to 1.

The output will be the decimal numbers (from 0 to 31) that have exactly 3 bits set to 1, followed by the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in each number.

Let's manually compute the combinations:
- 7 (binary 00111) has bits 0, 1, 2 set to 1.
- 11 (binary 01011) has bits 0, 1, 3 set to 1.
- 13 (binary 01101) has bits 0, 2, 3 set to 1.
- 14 (binary 01110) has bits 1, 2, 3 set to 1.
- 19 (binary 10011) has bits 0, 1, 4 set to 1.
- 21 (binary 10101) has bits 0, 2, 4 set to 1.
- 22 (binary 10110) has bits 1, 2, 4 set to 1.
- 25 (binary 11001) has bits 0, 3, 4 set to 1.
- 26 (binary 11010) has bits 1, 3, 4 set to 1.
- 28 (binary 11100) has bits 2, 3, 4 set to 1.
