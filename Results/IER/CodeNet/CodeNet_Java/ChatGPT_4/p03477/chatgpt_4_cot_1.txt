<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables left and right. The first two integers are added together to form the value of left, and the next two integers are added together to form the value of right.

Given the input `3 8 7 1`, the code performs the following operations:
- left = 3 + 8 = 11
- right = 7 + 1 = 8

After calculating the values of left and right, the code compares them using if-else statements:
- Since left (11) is greater than right (8), the condition of the first if statement is true.
- Therefore, the code will print "Left".

<<<Output>>>
Left
