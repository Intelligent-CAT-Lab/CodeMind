<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a FastScanner object to read input from System.in. It then reads three values: n = 4, k = 2, and s = 3.

An array `ans` of long integers with size n (4) is created and initialized with all elements as 0 by default.

A for loop runs from i = 0 to i < k (2), setting the first k elements of the `ans` array to the value of s (3). After this loop, the `ans` array contains the values [3, 3, 0, 0].

Another for loop runs from i = 0 to i < n (4), checking each element of the `ans` array. If an element is 0, it prints either s + 1 or 1, depending on whether s is not equal to 1000000000. Since s is 3, it prints s + 1, which is 4. If an element is not 0, it prints the value of the element.

The output will be the elements of the `ans` array separated by spaces. Since the first two elements are 3 and the last two are 0, the output will be "3 3 4 4" (without quotes).
