<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers from the input, which are 8 and 13, and assigns them to variables a and b, respectively.
It then calculates the expression (b-a)*(b-a+1)/2-b. Let's break down the calculation step by step:
1. b - a = 13 - 8 = 5
2. (b - a + 1) = 5 + 1 = 6
3. (b - a) * (b - a + 1) = 5 * 6 = 30
4. (b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15
5. (b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 - b = 15 - 13 = 2

The result of the calculation is 2, which is then printed to the console.
