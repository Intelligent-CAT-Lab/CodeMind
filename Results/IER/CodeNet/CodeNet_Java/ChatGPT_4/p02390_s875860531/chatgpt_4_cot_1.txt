<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with 46979 according to the input.
The variable hour is calculated by dividing S by 3600, which is the number of seconds in an hour. 46979 / 3600 equals 13 hours.
The variable min is calculated by taking the remainder of S divided by 3600, which gives the remaining seconds not accounted for by full hours, and then dividing that by 60, which is the number of seconds in a minute. (46979 % 3600) / 60 equals 3 minutes.
The variable sec is calculated by taking the remainder of the remaining seconds after accounting for full hours and full minutes. (46979 % 3600 % 60) equals 19 seconds.
The output is formatted as "hour:min:sec" using String.format and printed to the console.
