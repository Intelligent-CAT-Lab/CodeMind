<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array X of size 3 and reads three integers from the input using a Scanner object. The input provided is `1 3 4`. These values are stored in the array X at indices 0, 1, and 2 respectively.

The array X is then sorted using the Arrays.sort() method. After sorting, the array X will contain the values in ascending order, which will be `1 3 4`.

The code then prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted array, which are at indices 0 and 1. The values at these indices are 1 and 3, respectively.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of 1 and 3, which is 4.
