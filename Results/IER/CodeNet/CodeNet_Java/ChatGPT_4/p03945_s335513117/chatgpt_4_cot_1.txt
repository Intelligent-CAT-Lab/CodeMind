<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "BBBWW". A character array `c` is created with the same length as the input string.
The for loop iterates over the length of the string `s`, and each character of the string is assigned to the corresponding index in the character array `c`.

The variable `count` is initialized with 0. Another for loop starts from index 1 and goes up to the length of the string `s`. Inside this loop, the code checks if the current character `c[i]` is different from the previous character `c[i-1]`. If they are different, `count` is incremented.

The input string "BBBWW" has a change from 'B' to 'W' at index 3 (0-based index), so `count` will be incremented once.

After the loop finishes, the final value of `count` is printed, which is 1, as there is only one change in the sequence of characters from 'B' to 'W'.
