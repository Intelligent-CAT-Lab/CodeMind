<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three integer variables L, R, and d with the values 5, 10, and 2 respectively according to the input. It also initializes a counter variable cnt with 0.
It enters a for loop and iterates from L (5) to R (10) inclusive. For each integer i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by d (2) without a remainder using the modulo operator (%).
If the condition (i % d == 0) is true, it increments the counter cnt by 1.
The numbers between 5 and 10 that are divisible by 2 are 6, 8, and 10. Therefore, the counter cnt will be incremented three times.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of cnt, which is 3, as the output.
