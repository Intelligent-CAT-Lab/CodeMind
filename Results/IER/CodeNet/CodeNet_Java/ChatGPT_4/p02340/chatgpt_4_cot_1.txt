<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate the number of ways to distribute a certain number of balls into a certain number of boxes, where each box must contain at least one ball. The calculation is done using a recursive function with memoization.

The `dp` array is initialized with a size of 1005x1005 and all elements are set to -1, which is used to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

The input `5 3` means there are 5 balls and 3 boxes. The `recursive` function is called with these values.

The `recursive` function checks if the result for the current `num_ball` and `num_box` has already been calculated and stored in `dp`. If not, it proceeds with the calculation.

The base cases are:
- If `num_ball` is 0, there is 1 way to distribute the balls (no balls to distribute).
- If `num_box` is 1, there is also 1 way to distribute the balls (all balls go into the one box).

For the input `5 3`, neither base case applies, so the function enters a loop to calculate the number of ways recursively.

The loop iterates over the number of boxes from 1 to `num_box` (3 in this case). For each iteration, it calculates the number of ways to distribute the remaining balls (`num_ball` - `next_box`) into the same number of boxes (`next_box`). The result is added to `ret` and taken modulo `MOD` to prevent overflow.

The recursive calls will explore the following scenarios:
- 5 balls into 1 box, 4 balls into 2 boxes, 3 balls into 3 boxes
- 5 balls into 2 boxes, 3 balls into 3 boxes
- 5 balls into 3 boxes

The results of these recursive calls are added together and stored in `dp[5][3]`.

The final result is the value stored in `dp[5][3]` after all recursive calls have been made and the results have been combined.

The actual calculations are as follows:
- `recursive(5, 3)` calls `recursive(4, 1)`, `recursive(3, 2)`, and `recursive(2, 3)`
- `recursive(4, 1)` returns 1 (base case)
- `recursive(3, 2)` calls `recursive(2, 1)` and `recursive(1, 2)`
- `recursive(2, 1)` returns 1 (base case)
- `recursive(1, 2)` calls `recursive(0, 1)` and `recursive(0, 2)`
- Both `recursive(0, 1)` and `recursive(0, 2)` return 1 (base case)
- `recursive(1, 2)` returns 2 (sum of the two base cases)
- `recursive(3, 2)` returns 3 (sum of `recursive(2, 1)` and `recursive(1, 2)`)
- `recursive(2, 3)` calls `recursive(1, 1)`, `recursive(0, 2)`, and `recursive(0, 3)`
- `recursive(1, 1)` returns 1 (base case)
- Both `recursive(0, 2)` and `recursive(0, 3)` return 1 (base case)
- `recursive(2, 3)` returns 3 (sum of the three base cases)
- `recursive(5, 3)` returns 7 (sum of `recursive(4, 1)`, `recursive(3, 2)`, and `recursive(2, 3)`)

Therefore, the output of the code execution given the input `5 3` will be 7.
