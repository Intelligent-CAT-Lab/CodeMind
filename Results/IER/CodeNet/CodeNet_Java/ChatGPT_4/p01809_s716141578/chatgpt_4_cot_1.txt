<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `solve` method, a `gcd` (Greatest Common Divisor) method, and an `InputReader` class to handle input. The `solve` method is where the main logic of the program resides.

The `main` method initializes the `InputReader` with `System.in` and a `PrintWriter` with `System.out`. It then calls the `solve` method and flushes the output.

The `solve` method reads two integers `p` and `q` using the `InputReader`. In this case, `p` is 1 and `q` is 2.

The first `if` statement checks if `p` is 0, which it is not, so the program continues.

Next, the code calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` using the `gcd` method. Since `p` is 1 and `q` is 2, the GCD is 1.

The variable `a` is then assigned the value of `q` divided by the GCD of `p` and `q`, which is `2 / 1 = 2`.

The variable `ret` is initialized to 1. A `for` loop starts with `i` equal to 2 and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `a`. Since `a` is 2, the square root of `a` is approximately 1.41, and the loop will only execute for `i` equal to 2.

Inside the loop, the code checks if `a` is divisible by `i`. If it is not, the loop continues to the next iteration, but since `a` is 2 and `i` is also 2, `a` is divisible by `i`.

The code multiplies `ret` by `i` (which is 2), so `ret` becomes `1 * 2 = 2`.

Then, while `a` is divisible by `i`, `a` is divided by `i`. In this case, `a` becomes `2 / 2 = 1`.

After the loop, `ret` is multiplied by `a`, which is now 1, so `ret` remains 2.

Finally, the code prints the value of `ret`, which is 2, and exits.
