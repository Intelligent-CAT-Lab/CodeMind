<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `main` method and a `solve` method. The `main` method creates an instance of `Main` and calls the `solve` method, printing its result.

The `solve` method reads three long values from the standard input, which are `a`, `b`, and `n`. According to the input, `a` is 5, `b` is 7, and `n` is 4.

The method then calculates the value of `x` as the minimum of `b-1` and `n`. In this case, `x` will be the minimum of `7-1` (which is 6) and `4`, so `x` will be 4.

Next, the method calculates the value of `up` using the formula `a*(x%b)-(a%b)*(x%b)%b`. Plugging in the values, we get:
`up = 5*(4%7) - (5%7)*(4%7)%7`
`up = 5*4 - 5*4%7`
`up = 20 - 20%7`
`up = 20 - 6`
`up = 14`

Finally, the method returns the value of `up` divided by `b`, which is `14 / 7`.

The result of the `solve` method is then printed by the `main` method.
