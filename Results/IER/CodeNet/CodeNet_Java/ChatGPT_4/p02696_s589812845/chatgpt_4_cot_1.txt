<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three long integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and n respectively. The input values are 5, 7, and 4, so a=5, b=7, and n=4.

The code then calculates the minimum value between (b - 1) and n, which is the minimum between 6 (7 - 1) and 4. The minimum value is 4, so x is assigned the value 4.

Next, the code calculates the value of ans by multiplying a and x, then dividing by b. This is equivalent to (a * x) / b. Substituting the values, we get (5 * 4) / 7, which is 20 / 7.

Since the division is between long integers, the result is the integer part of the division, which is 2 (the fractional part is discarded).

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
