The input provided is `2 3`. The `LightScanner` class reads this input and splits it into two tokens, which are then parsed as doubles `r1` and `r2` with values 2.0 and 3.0 respectively.

The `AEquivalentResistance` class has a method `solve` that calculates the equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel. The formula for the equivalent resistance `R` of two resistors `r1` and `r2` in parallel is `1/R = 1/r1 + 1/r2`. The method calculates this value and then uses the `LightWriter` class to output the result with 10 decimal places.

The calculation is as follows:
1/R = 1/2.0 + 1/3.0
1/R = 0.5 + 0.3333333333
1/R = 0.8333333333
R = 1 / 0.8333333333
R â‰ˆ 1.2

The `LightWriter` class formats the output to display the result with 10 decimal places. It will print the integer part of the number, followed by a decimal point, and then the fractional part up to 10 decimal places. The number is rounded half up to the nearest value at the 10th decimal place.

The output will be the equivalent resistance `R` with 10 decimal places, which is approximately 1.2000000000.
