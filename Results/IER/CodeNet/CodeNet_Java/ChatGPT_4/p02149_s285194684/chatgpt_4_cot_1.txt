<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method and a nested `Methods` class with several utility methods. The `main` method creates a `Scanner` object to read from standard input and a `PrintWriter` object for output. It then calls the `solve` method, passing the `Scanner`, `PrintWriter`, and an instance of the `Methods` class.

The `solve` method reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It initializes an empty string `ans`. It then has three conditional statements to check which of the three integers is the greatest. It assigns the corresponding letter "A", "B", or "C" to `ans` based on which integer is the greatest. Since only one of these conditions can be true, `ans` will contain only one letter.

Given the input `1000 900 850`, the first condition `a > b && a > c` is true because `a` (1000) is greater than both `b` (900) and `c` (850). Therefore, `ans` is set to "A". The other conditions are not checked because they are independent `if` statements and the first condition has already been satisfied.

Finally, the `solve` method prints the value of `ans` using the `PrintWriter` object and then closes both the `Scanner` and `PrintWriter`.

The output will be the value of `ans`, which is "A" in this case.
