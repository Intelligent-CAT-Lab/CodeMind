<<<Analysis>>>
The input `4 4` initializes the variables n and x with the values 4 and 4 respectively. The variables left and right are initialized with 1 and 2 * n - 1 (which is 7 in this case).

The first if condition checks if n is equal to 2, which it is not, so it skips that block.

The second if condition checks if x + 1 is less than or equal to right (which is true, 4 + 1 <= 7) and if left is less than or equal to x - 2 (which is also true, 1 <= 4 - 2). Since both conditions are true, it enters this block.

It prints "Yes" to indicate that it's possible to arrange the numbers.

A TreeSet named set is created and filled with numbers from 1 to 2 * n - 1 (1 to 7). Then, the numbers x (4), x + 1 (5), x - 2 (2), and x - 1 (3) are removed from the set, leaving the set with the numbers {1, 6, 7}.

A StringBuilder named sb is used to build the output string. A for loop runs from 1 to 2 * n - 1 (1 to 7), and within the loop, it checks for specific indices (n - 2, n - 1, n, n + 1) to append the previously removed numbers in a specific order to sb. For other indices, it takes the next available number from the set, appends it to sb, and removes that number from the set.

The specific order for appending is as follows:
- At index n - 2 (which is 2), append x - 2 (which is 2).
- At index n - 1 (which is 3), append x + 1 (which is 5).
- At index n (which is 4), append x (which is 4).
- At index n + 1 (which is 5), append x - 1 (which is 3).

For the remaining indices (1, 6, 7), the numbers from the set are appended in ascending order (1, 6, 7).

After the loop, the StringBuilder sb contains the following sequence of numbers:
1
2
5
4
3
6
7

This sequence is then printed as the output.
