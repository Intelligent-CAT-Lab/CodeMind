<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then creates a HashSet of Integer type called paintCans. The HashSet is a collection that contains no duplicate elements.

The code reads three integers from the input and adds them to the HashSet paintCans. Since a Set does not allow duplicate values, if any of the input integers are the same, they will be counted only once.

The input provided is `3 1 4`. These are three distinct integers, so when they are added to the HashSet, the size of the HashSet will be 3 because there are no duplicates among them.

Finally, the code prints out the size of the HashSet, which is the number of unique integers that were input.

<<<Output>>>
3
