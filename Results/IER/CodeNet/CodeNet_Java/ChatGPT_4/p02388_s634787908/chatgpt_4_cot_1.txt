<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class named Main with a method called solve and the main method. The solve method is where the main logic of the program resides.

1. A new Scanner object is created to read input from the standard input stream (System.in).
2. The program waits for the user to input an integer, which is read by sc.nextInt() and stored in the variable x.
3. The input provided is `2`, so x is set to 2.
4. The variable kakeru is declared without an initial value.
5. The next line calculates the cube of x (2^3) and assigns the result to kakeru. So, kakeru is now 2 * 2 * 2, which equals 8.
6. The program then prints out the value of kakeru, which is 8.

The main method simply creates an instance of the Main class and calls the solve method on that instance, which triggers the execution of the steps described above.
