<<<Analysis>>>
The input is read and split into four strings, which are then parsed into long integers and assigned to variables A, B, C, and K with values 1, 2, 3, and 1 respectively. The variable var is initialized with the value 1000000000000000000L.

The code then checks if the absolute difference between A and B is greater than var. Since the absolute difference between A (1) and B (2) is 1, which is not greater than var, the code does not print "Unfair" and proceeds to the else block.

In the else block, the code checks if K is even. Since K is 1, which is odd, the code executes the else part of this conditional and prints the result of B - A.

Therefore, the output will be 2 - 1, which is 1.
