<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that creates an instance of `Main` and calls its `solve` method. The `solve` method uses a custom `MyScanner` class to read input strings.

The `MyScanner` class is designed to read strings from the standard input using a `BufferedReader`. It has a method `next()` that reads the next string from the input, splitting the input line by spaces if necessary.

In the `solve` method, three strings `A`, `B`, and `C` are read from the input. The program then checks if the last character of `A` is the same as the first character of `B`, and if the last character of `B` is the same as the first character of `C`. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the input `rng gorilla apple`, the program will perform the following checks:
- Compare the last character of `A` ("rng") with the first character of `B` ("gorilla"). The last character of `A` is 'g', and the first character of `B` is also 'g'.
- Compare the last character of `B` ("gorilla") with the first character of `C` ("apple"). The last character of `B` is 'a', and the first character of `C` is also 'a'.

Since both conditions are met, the program will output "YES".
