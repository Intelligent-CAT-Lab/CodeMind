<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads an integer value into the variable n. The input provided is `0`, so n is set to 0.
The code then enters a switch statement with the value of n. Since n is 0, it matches the first case label (case 0) and executes the code block associated with it, which is printing the number 1 to the console. After printing, the break statement is encountered, which exits the switch statement.
The Scanner object is then closed with sc.close(), and the program ends without executing any other case or the default case.
