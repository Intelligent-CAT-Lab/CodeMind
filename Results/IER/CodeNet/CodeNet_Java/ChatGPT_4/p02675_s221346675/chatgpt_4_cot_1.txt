<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that creates a `FastReader` object to read input and a `PrintWriter` object to write output. The `main` method then creates an instance of the `ATherefore` class and calls its `solve` method, passing in the `FastReader` and `PrintWriter` objects.

The `ATherefore` class has a `solve` method that reads a string `a` using the `FastReader` object. It then takes the last character of the string `a`, converts it to an integer `c`, and subtracts the ASCII value of '0' to get the actual numeric value of the last digit.

The `solve` method then checks the value of `c` and prints out a corresponding string based on the value:
- If `c` is 0, 1, 6, or 8, it prints "pon".
- If `c` is 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9, it prints "hon".
- For any other value (which would only be 3), it prints "bon".

Given the input `16`, the last digit is 6. According to the conditions in the `solve` method, the output should be "pon" because the last digit 6 falls into the first group of numbers.

pon
