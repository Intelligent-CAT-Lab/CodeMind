<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and x are initialized with 4, 8, and 2 respectively according to the input.

The variable sum is calculated as (b / x) + 1, which is (8 / 2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.
The variable diff is calculated as (a / x) + 1, which is (4 / 2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.

Then the code checks if a % x is equal to 0. Since 4 % 2 is indeed 0, the condition is true, and diff is decremented by 1, making diff = 3 - 1 = 2.

Finally, the code prints the result of sum - diff, which is 5 - 2 = 3.
