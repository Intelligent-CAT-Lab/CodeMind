<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input. The boolean variable found is initialized with false.
The code enters a nested for loop with two variables h and w, both ranging from 1 to 3500.
Inside the inner loop, it calculates the value of Num as N*h*w and Den as 4*h*w-N*w-N*h.
It then checks if Den is greater than 0 and if Num is divisible by Den without any remainder (Num % Den == 0).
If both conditions are met, it calculates the value of ans as Num / Den, prints the values of h, ans, and w, sets found to true, and breaks out of the inner loop.
If found is true, it also breaks out of the outer loop.
The first combination of h and w that satisfies the conditions is when h=1 and w=1:
Num = 2*1*1 = 2
Den = 4*1*1 - 2*1 - 2*1 = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0
Since Den is not greater than 0, the loop continues.
The next combination that satisfies the conditions is when h=1 and w=2:
Num = 2*1*2 = 4
Den = 4*1*2 - 2*2 - 2*1 = 8 - 4 - 2 = 2
Since Den is greater than 0 and Num % Den == 0 (4 % 2 == 0), the conditions are met.
ans = Num / Den = 4 / 2 = 2
The program prints "1 2 2", sets found to true, and breaks out of both loops.
<<<Output>>>
1 2 2
