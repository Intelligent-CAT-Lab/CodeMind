<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a single character '2', which is converted to an integer value of 2 by subtracting the ASCII value of '0'. This integer value is stored in the variable `n`.

An integer array `base` of size `n` (which is 2) is created and initialized with the values {1, 2}.

The `make` method is called with the initial parameters `value = 0`, `mask = 0`, `base = {1, 2}`, and `size = 2`.

The `make` method is a recursive method that generates all permutations of the numbers in the `base` array. It uses `value` to build the current permutation and `mask` to keep track of which numbers have been used.

The base case of the recursion is when `mask` equals `(1 << size) - 1`, which is `3` for `size = 2`. This means all numbers have been used in the permutation.

The `make` method will generate two permutations for `size = 2`: `12` and `21`. These permutations are added to the `TreeSet` `all`, which automatically sorts them.

After the recursive calls, the `StringBuilder` `sb` is used to build the output string. The `toString` method is called for each value in the `TreeSet` `all` to convert the integer permutations into a character array with spaces between the digits.

The `toString` method takes an integer `x` and the `size` and returns a character array representing the number with spaces inserted between the digits. For example, the integer `12` becomes the character array `{'1', ' ', '2'}`.

The output is then printed to the console.

For the input `2`, the expected output is the permutations of `1` and `2` with spaces between them, sorted in ascending order. This means the output should be:
```
1 2
2 1
```

1 2
