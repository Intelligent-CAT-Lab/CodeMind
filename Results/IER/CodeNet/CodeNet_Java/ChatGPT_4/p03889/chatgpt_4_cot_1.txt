<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "pdbq". The string is converted to a character array `arr` with the characters ['p', 'd', 'b', 'q'].
The for loop iterates over each character in the array and applies the following transformations:
- 'b' is replaced with 'd'
- 'd' is replaced with 'b'
- 'p' is replaced with 'q'
- 'q' is replaced with 'p'

After the loop, the array `arr` will have the characters ['q', 'b', 'd', 'p'].

A StringBuilder `sb` is created with the string "qbdp" and then reversed, resulting in "pdbq".

Finally, the code checks if the original string `s` is equal to the reversed and transformed string `sb.toString()`. Since "pdbq" is equal to "pdbq", the condition is true.

Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
