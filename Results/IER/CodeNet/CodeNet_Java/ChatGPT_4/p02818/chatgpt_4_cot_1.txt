<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three long variables A, B, and K with the input values 2, 3, and 3 respectively. It then checks three conditions:
1. If K is less than or equal to A, it subtracts K from A.
2. If K is greater than A but less than or equal to A+B, it subtracts K-A from B and sets A to 0.
3. If K is greater than A+B, it sets both A and B to 0.

In this case, K (3) is greater than A (2) but less than A+B (2+3=5), so the second condition is true. Therefore, B is set to B-(K-A), which is 3-(3-2) = 3-1 = 2, and A is set to 0. The final values of A and B are 0 and 2 respectively.

The code then prints the values of A and B separated by a space.
