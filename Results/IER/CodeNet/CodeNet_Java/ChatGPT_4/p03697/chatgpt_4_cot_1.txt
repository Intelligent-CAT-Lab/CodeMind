<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input. In this case, a is assigned the value 6 and b is assigned the value 3.

Next, the code checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to 10. Since 6 + 3 equals 9, which is not greater than or equal to 10, the condition of the if statement is false.

Therefore, the else block is executed, and the sum of a and b (which is 9) is printed to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
9
