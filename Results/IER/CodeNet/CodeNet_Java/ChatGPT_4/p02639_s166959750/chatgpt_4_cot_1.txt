<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method and a nested `FastScanner` class to read input. The `main` method creates an instance of `PrintWriter` to output data and an instance of `FastScanner` to read input.

The `FastScanner` class has methods to read different types of data. The `readArray` method reads an array of integers from the input.

In the `main` method, an array `a` of size 5 is read using `fs.readArray(5)`. The input provided is `0 2 3 4 5`, so the array `a` will be `{0, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.

A for loop iterates over the array `a`. The loop checks for the first occurrence of the value `0` in the array. When it finds a `0`, it sets `x` to the index of that `0` plus 1 (since the problem seems to be 1-indexed) and breaks out of the loop.

Since the first element of the array `a` is `0`, the loop sets `x` to `1` (0th index + 1) and breaks immediately.

The value of `x` is then printed, which is `1`.

Finally, the `PrintWriter` is closed using `out.close()`.
