<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two variables n and k with the values 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. It then declares two long arrays min and max with the size of n+1.

The first for loop calculates the minimum possible sum of i elements by adding the current index to the previous value in the min array. The min array after the loop will be [0, 1, 3, 6].

The second for loop calculates the maximum possible sum of i elements by adding the value of (n - current index) to the previous value in the max array. The max array after the loop will be [3, 5, 6, 6].

The variable ans is initialized with 0. Another for loop starts from k-1 (which is 1) to n (which is 3). Inside the loop, it calculates the difference between max[i] and min[i] and adds 1 to it, then adds this value to ans. The loop runs for i = 1, 2, and 3.

For i = 1: ans += max[1] - min[1] + 1 => ans += 5 - 1 + 1 => ans += 5
For i = 2: ans += max[2] - min[2] + 1 => ans += 6 - 3 + 1 => ans += 4
For i = 3: ans += max[3] - min[3] + 1 => ans += 6 - 6 + 1 => ans += 1

The total ans after the loop is 5 + 4 + 1 = 10.

Finally, it prints the value of ans modulo 1000000007, which is 10 % 1000000007 = 10.
