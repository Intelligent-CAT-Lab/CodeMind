<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable n, which in this case is 2. The Scanner is then closed as it is no longer needed.

Next, the code calculates the cube of the number n by using the Math.pow method, which takes two double arguments. The first argument is the base (n, which is cast to a double), and the second argument is the exponent (3). The result of this operation is stored in the variable a.

The Math.pow method returns a double, so the result of cubing 2 (which is 8.0) is stored as a double in variable a.

Finally, the code prints out the result of the calculation by casting the double to an int to remove any decimal points. Since the cube of 2 is 8.0, casting it to an int will result in 8.

<<<Output>>>
8
