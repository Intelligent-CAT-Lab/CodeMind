<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 5 4` is read and split into an array of strings ["2", "5", "4"], which is then parsed into an integer array `arr` with values [2, 5, 4]. The array is sorted to [2, 4, 5].

The variable `step` is initialized to 0. The code checks if the difference between the third and second elements of the sorted array is greater than 3. Since `arr[2] - arr[1]` is `5 - 4 = 1`, which is not greater than 3, the first if condition is not executed.

The code then checks if the difference between the second and first elements of the sorted array is greater than 3. Since `arr[1] - arr[0]` is `4 - 2 = 2`, which is not greater than 3, the second if condition is not executed.

A `Tuple3` object `t` is created with the sorted array values and the current `step` value, which is still 0.

The `bfs` method is called with `t` as the argument. A queue `que` is created and `t` is added to it.

The `bfs` method enters a while loop that continues until the queue is empty. Inside the loop, the first element `cur` is polled from the queue.

The `isEq` method of `cur` checks if all elements of `cur.e` are equal. Since they are not, the loop continues.

The code then checks which element of `cur.e` is the smallest and adds 2 to the smallest element(s), creating new `Tuple3` objects with the updated values and incrementing their `step` by 1. These objects are added to the queue.

For the input `2 4 5`, the first `Tuple3` added to the queue will be `4 4 5` with `step` incremented to 1. The second `Tuple3` added will be `3 5 5` with `step` incremented to 1.

The loop continues, and the next `Tuple3` polled from the queue is `4 4 5`. Since the elements are not equal, the loop continues and adds two new `Tuple3` objects to the queue: `6 4 5` and `5 5 5`, both with `step` incremented to 2.

The next `Tuple3` polled from the queue is `3 5 5`. Since the elements are not equal, the loop continues and adds two new `Tuple3` objects to the queue: `5 5 5` and `4 6 5`, both with `step` incremented to 2.

The next `Tuple3` polled from the queue is `6 4 5`. Since the elements are not equal, the loop continues and adds two new `Tuple3` objects to the queue: `8 4 5` and `7 5 5`, both with `step` incremented to 3.

The next `Tuple3` polled from the queue is `5 5 5`. Since all elements are equal, the `isEq` method returns true, and the loop exits.

The `step` value of the `Tuple3` object `5 5 5` is printed, which is 2.
