The variables A, B, and K are initialized with 5, 4, and 2 respectively according to the input.

The for loop will run for K/2 times, which is 2/2 = 1 time in this case.

In the first iteration of the loop:
- A is halved, so A becomes 5/2 which is 2 (since A is an integer, the result is truncated).
- B is updated to be the half of the sum of the new A and the old B, so B becomes (2+4)/2 which is 3.
- A is then updated to be the sum of the new A and the new B, so A becomes 2+3 which is 5.

Since K is 2, the loop runs only once and the condition K%2==1 is false (because 2%2 equals 0), the if block is not executed.

Finally, the program prints the values of A and B, which are 5 and 3 respectively.
