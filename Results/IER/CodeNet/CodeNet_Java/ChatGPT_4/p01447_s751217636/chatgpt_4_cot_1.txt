<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input value 8, then decremented by 1, resulting in n = 7. The variable count is initialized with 0.

The while loop will execute as long as n is greater than 0. Inside the loop, n is divided by 3 and the result is assigned back to n, and count is incremented by 1.

The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: n = 7 / 3 = 2 (since n is an integer, the fractional part is discarded), count = 1
- Second iteration: n = 2 / 3 = 0 (again, the fractional part is discarded), count = 2

The loop stops because n is no longer greater than 0.

The final value of count, which is 2, is printed as the output.

<<<Output>>>
2
