The variables n and m are initialized with 1 and 6 respectively according to the input. The variable c is initialized with 0.
The if condition checks if n * 2 is less than or equal to m, which is not true in this case (1 * 2 is not less than or equal to 6).
Therefore, the else block is executed, where c is assigned the value of m divided by 2, which is 6 / 2 = 3. Then m is set to 0.
After the else block, c is incremented by m / 4. Since m is now 0, m / 4 is 0, and c remains 3.
The final value of c, which is 3, is printed as the output.
