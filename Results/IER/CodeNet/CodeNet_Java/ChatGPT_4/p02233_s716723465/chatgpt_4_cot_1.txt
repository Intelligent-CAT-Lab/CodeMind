<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `arr` of size 45 and sets the first two elements to 1, which corresponds to the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. It then enters a for loop to calculate the rest of the Fibonacci sequence up to the 45th element. The loop starts from index 2 and goes up to the length of the array (45), and each element `arr[i]` is calculated as the sum of the two preceding elements `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i-2]`.

After the loop, the code reads an integer `n` from the input using a Scanner object. Given the input `3`, the variable `n` is set to 3. The code then prints the value of `arr[n]`, which is the 3rd element in the Fibonacci sequence array.

Since the Fibonacci sequence starts with 1, 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two, the sequence goes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on. Therefore, `arr[3]` is the 4th element in the Fibonacci sequence (since array indices start at 0), which is 3.
