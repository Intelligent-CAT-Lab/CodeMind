<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method and an inner class `FastScanner` that is used to read input from `System.in`. The `FastScanner` class has methods to read different types of data, but in this case, we are only interested in the `nextInt` method, which is used to read integers.

The `main` method creates an instance of `FastScanner` and reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. These integers are assigned the values 10, 30, and 20 respectively according to the given input.

The code then checks if any two of these integers add up to the third one. It does this by evaluating three boolean expressions:
- `i` checks if `a + b` equals `c` (10 + 30 == 20), which is false.
- `j` checks if `a + c` equals `b` (10 + 20 == 30), which is false.
- `k` checks if `b + c` equals `a` (30 + 20 == 10), which is false.

Since none of these conditions are true, the `if` statement evaluates to false, and the code proceeds to the `else` block, which prints "No".
