<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with 4 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The if statement checks if a is greater than or equal to b, which is true in this case (4 >= 3).
Since the condition is true, it enters the first for loop.
The for loop iterates 4 times (from i = 0 to i = 3) because the value of a is 4.
During each iteration, it prints the value of b, which is 3.
Therefore, the number 3 will be printed 4 times in a row without any spaces or newlines between the numbers.
