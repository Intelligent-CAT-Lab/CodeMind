<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two integer variables a and b with the values 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. It then closes the scanner as it is no longer needed.

The variable d is calculated by integer division of a by b, which results in 1 because 3 divided by 2 is 1 with a remainder.

The variable r is calculated by the remainder of the division of a by b, which is 1 because 3 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1.

The variable f is a string that represents the floating-point division of a by b, formatted to 5 decimal places. Since a is cast to a double (1.0 * a), the division results in a floating-point number. The division 3.0 / 2 equals 1.5, and when formatted to 5 decimal places, it becomes "1.50000".

Finally, the code prints the values of d, r, and f using printf. The output will be the integer division result, the remainder, and the floating-point division result formatted to 5 decimal places, separated by spaces.

<<<Output>>>
1 1 1.50000
