<<<Analysis>>>
The input is the number 8. The program first converts this number to its binary representation using `Long.toBinaryString(n)`, which results in the string "1000". The length of this string is 4, so the variable `start` is set to 32 - 4 = 28.

The program then prints four lines of output, each 32 characters long, representing different manipulations of the binary representation of the input number.

1. The first loop prints the binary representation of the number, padded with leading zeros to make it 32 bits long. Since `start` is 28, it will print 28 zeros followed by the binary representation "1000".

2. The second loop prints the bitwise NOT of the binary representation, again padded to 32 bits. It prints 28 ones followed by the bitwise NOT of "1000", which is "0111".

3. The third loop prints the binary representation without the first bit, followed by a zero at the end. It prints 27 zeros (since the loop starts from 1), followed by "100", and then a zero at the end.

4. The fourth loop prints the binary representation without the last bit, preceded by a zero. It prints a zero, followed by 27 zeros, and then "100".
