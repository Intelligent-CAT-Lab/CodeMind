The input provided initializes N with 10 and W with 2. The array `a` is initialized with a size of 21 (10 * 2 + 1).

The first loop initializes `a[1]` with W / 2, which is 1. Then it enters a nested loop structure. The outer loop runs from i = 2 (since W / 2 + 1) to i < W (which is 2), but since 2 is not less than 2, the outer loop does not execute.

The second loop runs for i = W (which is 2) to i <= N (which is 10). It increments `a[i - W + 1]` by 1 and decrements `a[i + 1]` by 1 for each iteration. This loop will run for i values 2 through 10. The changes to the array `a` will be as follows:
- For i = 2: `a[1]` is incremented by 1, `a[3]` is decremented by 1.
- For i = 3: `a[2]` is incremented by 1, `a[4]` is decremented by 1.
- For i = 4: `a[3]` is incremented by 1, `a[5]` is decremented by 1.
- For i = 5: `a[4]` is incremented by 1, `a[6]` is decremented by 1.
- For i = 6: `a[5]` is incremented by 1, `a[7]` is decremented by 1.
- For i = 7: `a[6]` is incremented by 1, `a[8]` is decremented by 1.
- For i = 8: `a[7]` is incremented by 1, `a[9]` is decremented by 1.
- For i = 9: `a[8]` is incremented by 1, `a[10]` is decremented by 1.
- For i = 10: `a[9]` is incremented by 1, `a[11]` is decremented by 1.

The final loop accumulates the values in the array `a` and appends them to a StringBuilder `sb`, separated by spaces. The loop runs from i = 1 to i <= N - W + 1 (which is 9). The array `a` after accumulation will have the following values for indices 1 through 9:
- `a[1]` = 2 (initially 1 + 1 from the second loop)
- `a[2]` = 2 (initially 0 + 1 from the second loop + 1 from the accumulation of `a[1]`)
- `a[3]` = 2 (initially 0 + 1 from the second loop + 1 from the accumulation of `a[2]`)
- `a[4]` = 2 (initially 0 + 1 from the second loop + 1 from the accumulation of `a[3]`)
- `a[5]` = 2 (initially 0 + 1 from the second loop + 1 from the accumulation of `a[4]`)
- `a[6]` = 2 (initially 0 + 1 from the second loop + 1 from the accumulation of `a[5]`)
- `a[7]` = 2 (initially 0 + 1 from the second loop + 1 from the accumulation of `a[6]`)
- `a[8]` = 2 (initially 0 + 1 from the second loop + 1 from the accumulation of `a[7]`)
- `a[9]` = 1 (initially 0 + 1 from the second loop, but no accumulation since `a[10]` was decremented)

The StringBuilder `sb` will contain the string "2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1" after the final loop.
