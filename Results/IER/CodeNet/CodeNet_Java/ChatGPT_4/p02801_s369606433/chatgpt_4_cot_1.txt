<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads a single character from the input and assigns it to the variable 'c'. The input provided is 'a'.

The next line of code calculates the integer value of the next character by adding 1 to the ASCII value of the character stored in 'c'. Since 'a' has an ASCII value of 97, adding 1 to it gives 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'.

The Character.toChars method is then called with the integer value 98, which converts this integer back to a character array containing the character 'b'.

Finally, the code prints the character 'b' to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
b
