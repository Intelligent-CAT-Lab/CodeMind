<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 20 according to the input. An integer array ans of size N (20) is created and initialized with all elements as 0.

The code then enters a triple nested for loop where i, j, and k iterate from 1 to the square root of N (inclusive). For each combination of i, j, and k, it calculates the value of n using the formula n = i*i + j*j + k*k + i*j + j*k + k*i.

If the calculated value of n is less than or equal to N (20 in this case), it increments the value at index n-1 in the ans array by 1.

After all iterations, the code prints the values in the ans array from index 0 to N-1 (19 in this case).

Let's calculate the values manually:

For i=1, j=1, k=1: n = 1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6, ans[5]++
For i=1, j=1, k=2: n = 1+1+4+1+2+2 = 11, ans[10]++
For i=1, j=2, k=2: n = 1+4+4+2+4+4 = 19, ans[18]++
For i=2, j=2, k=2: n = 4+4+4+4+4+4 = 24, which is greater than N, so it's not counted.

The rest of the combinations will either repeat the above results or exceed the value of N, so they won't affect the ans array.

The final ans array will have the following counts:
- ans[5] = 1 (from i=1, j=1, k=1)
- ans[10] = 1 (from i=1, j=1, k=2)
- ans[18] = 1 (from i=1, j=2, k=2)
- All other indices will remain 0.

The output will be the values of the ans array from index 0 to 19, printed on separate lines.
