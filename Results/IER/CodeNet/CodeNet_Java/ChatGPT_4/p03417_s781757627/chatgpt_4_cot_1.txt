<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two long variables n and m with the values 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. Then it calculates the absolute value of the expression (n-2)*(m-2), which in this case is (2-2)*(2-2) = 0*0 = 0. Since the absolute value of 0 is still 0, the variable ans is set to 0. Finally, the code prints out the value of ans, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
