<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer from the input, which is `2` in this case, and stores it in the variable `a`. It then calculates the expression `a + a * a + a * a * a`. For `a = 2`, this expression evaluates as follows:
- `a * a` is `2 * 2`, which equals `4`.
- `a * a * a` is `2 * 2 * 2`, which equals `8`.
- Adding these together along with `a` itself gives `2 + 4 + 8`, which equals `14`.

The result of the calculation is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
14
