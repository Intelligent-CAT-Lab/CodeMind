<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 432 according to the input.
The program enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to 432 to find an integer i such that when i is multiplied by 1.08 (which represents an 8% tax), the result is exactly 432.
Inside the for loop, the variable wk is calculated as the integer part of i multiplied by 1.08.
The program checks if wk is equal to N (432). If it finds such an i, it prints i and returns, ending the method.
If the loop finishes without finding such an i, the program prints ":(".
To find the correct i, we can manually check a few values:
For i = 400, wk = (int)(400 * 1.08) = 432, which is equal to N.
Therefore, the loop will terminate when i is 400, and the program will print 400.
<<<Output>>>
400
