The input string is `?&?|?&?|?&?`.

The `Parser` class is used to parse the input string into a tree of `Node` objects. The `getFormula` method starts the parsing process, which constructs the tree based on the operators and terms in the input string.

The `getOrExpr` method is called first, which calls `getAndExpr` to get the left-hand side of the first OR (`|`) operator. The `getAndExpr` method calls `getTerm` twice, which recognizes the `?` character and creates two `VarNode` objects. These are combined into an `AndNode`.

The `getOrExpr` method then sees the OR (`|`) operator and calls `getAndExpr` again to get the right-hand side of the OR operator. This process repeats, creating another `AndNode` from two `VarNode` objects.

Finally, the two `AndNode` objects are combined into an `OrNode`. This process repeats once more for the last segment of the input string, resulting in a tree structure that represents the input formula.

The `Node` class and its subclasses (`VarNode`, `AndNode`, `OrNode`) implement methods `calc0` and `calc1` to calculate the cost of setting the entire expression to 0 or 1, respectively.

The `VarNode` has a cost of 1 for both `calc0` and `calc1` since it's a single variable that can be set to either 0 or 1 with a cost of 1.

The `AndNode` calculates `calc0` as the minimum of setting the left child to 0 or setting the left child to 1 and the right child to 0. It calculates `calc1` as the sum of setting both the left and right children to 1.

The `OrNode` calculates `calc0` as the sum of setting both the left and right children to 0. It calculates `calc1` as the minimum of setting the left child to 1 or setting the left child to 0 and the right child to 1.

The final output is the cost of setting the entire expression to 0 and to 1, which is calculated by calling `get0` and `get1` on the root node of the tree.

Let's calculate the costs for the given input:

1. For the first `AndNode` created from `?&?`, the cost of setting it to 0 is 1 (set the left `VarNode` to 0), and the cost of setting it to 1 is 2 (set both `VarNode` to 1).
2. For the second `AndNode` created from `?&?`, the costs are the same as the first `AndNode`.
3. The first `OrNode` created from `?&?|?&?` has a cost of setting it to 0 as 2 (sum of setting both `AndNode` to 0), and the cost of setting it to 1 is 1 (set the left `AndNode` to 1, which is cheaper than setting the right `AndNode` to 1).
4. For the third `AndNode` created from `?&?`, the costs are the same as the first `AndNode`.
5. The second `OrNode` created from the entire expression `?&?|?&?|?&?` has a cost of setting it to 0 as 3 (sum of setting the first `OrNode` and the third `AndNode` to 0), and the cost of setting it to 1 is 2 (set the first `OrNode` to 1 and the third `AndNode` to 0).

Therefore, the output will be the cost of setting the entire expression to 0 and to 1, which is 3 and 2, respectively.
