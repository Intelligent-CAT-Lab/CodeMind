<<<Analysis>>>
The input "125" is read and stored in the variable S. Since the length of S is not 1, the program proceeds to the next part.

An integer array N of the same length as S is created to store the individual digits of S. The variable patternCount is initialized to 1, and a temporary string tmpBit is initialized to an empty string.

The for loop iterates over the length of N (which is 3 in this case), and each character of S is converted to an integer and stored in the corresponding index of N. The patternCount is multiplied by 2 for each iteration after the first, and tmpBit is appended with "1". After the loop, patternCount is 4 (2^2) and tmpBit is "11".

A long variable sum is initialized to 0. Another for loop is used to iterate from 0 to patternCount (0 to 3). For each iteration, the binary representation of the loop index i is calculated and stored in bin. Leading zeros are added to bin until its length matches that of tmpBit.

A string add is initialized with the first element of N. The inner for loop iterates over the length of bin. If the character at the current position in bin is '1', the current value of add is added to sum, and add is reset to an empty string. Then, the next digit from N is appended to add.

After the inner loop, if add is not empty, its value is added to sum.

The iterations work as follows:
- i = 0, bin = "00", add = "125", sum = 0 + 125 = 125
- i = 1, bin = "01", add = "12" (after first loop), "5" (after second loop), sum = 125 + 12 + 5 = 142
- i = 2, bin = "10", add = "1" (after first loop), "25" (after second loop), sum = 142 + 1 + 25 = 168
- i = 3, bin = "11", add = "1" (after first loop), "2" (after second loop), "5" (after third loop), sum = 168 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 176

Finally, the sum is printed out, which is 176.
