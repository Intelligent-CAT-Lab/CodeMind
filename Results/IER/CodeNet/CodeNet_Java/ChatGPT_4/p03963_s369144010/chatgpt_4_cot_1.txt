<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method and a `FastScanner` class to read input efficiently. The `main` method reads two integers, `N` and `K`, using the `FastScanner` class.

Given the input `2 2`, the variables `N` and `K` are initialized with the values 2 and 2, respectively.

The code then calculates the value of `ans` using the formula `K * (long)Math.pow((K-1), (N-1))`. Plugging in the values of `N` and `K`, we get:

`ans = 2 * (long)Math.pow((2-1), (2-1))`
`ans = 2 * (long)Math.pow(1, 1)`
`ans = 2 * 1`
`ans = 2`

The calculated value of `ans` is then printed to the console.

<<<Output>>>
2
