<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable result is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from n - 1 (which is 1) down to 1 (inclusive), decrementing i by 1 each iteration.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current value of i to result. Since i starts at 1 and the loop runs while i is greater than 0, it only runs once.
The value of result after the loop is the sum of integers from 1 to n - 1, which in this case is just 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of result as output, which is 1.
