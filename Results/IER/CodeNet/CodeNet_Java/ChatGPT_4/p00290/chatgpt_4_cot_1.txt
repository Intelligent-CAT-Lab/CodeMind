The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, d and c, from the input. According to the given input, d is assigned the value 20 and c is assigned the value 2. The code then calculates the product of d and c by multiplying them together and prints the result to the standard output. The multiplication of 20 and 2 results in 40.
