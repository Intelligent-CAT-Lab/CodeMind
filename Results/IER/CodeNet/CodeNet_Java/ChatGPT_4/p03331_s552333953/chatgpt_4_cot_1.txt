The variable N is initialized with 15 according to the input. Three arrays a, b, and c of size 15 are created.

The first for loop initializes the arrays a and b. It starts from index 1 and goes up to index 14 (since it iterates while i < N, and N is 15). For each i, a[i] is set to i, and b[i] is set to N - i. This means that a and b will be filled as follows:
a: [0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 13, 14]
b: [0, 14, 13, 12, ..., 2, 1]

The second for loop calculates the sum of the digits of the corresponding elements in arrays a and b using the sum method and stores the result in the corresponding index of array c. The sum method adds up the digits of two numbers. For example, sum(2, 13) would be 2 + 1 + 3 = 6. The array c will be filled as follows (ignoring index 0 since the loop starts from 1):
c: [0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]

The Arrays.sort(c) method sorts the array c in ascending order. After sorting, the array c will look like this:
c: [0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]

Finally, the program prints the second smallest element in the sorted array c, which is c[1]. Since the array is sorted in ascending order, c[1] will be 5.
