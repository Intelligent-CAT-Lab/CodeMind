<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that instantiates a new `Solver` object. The `Solver` class has a constructor that calls the `main` method and flushes the `PrintWriter` object.

In the `Solver`'s `main` method, a `BigInteger` `m` is initialized to 1. A for loop runs 1500 times, each time multiplying `m` by the `BigInteger` representation of the current loop index plus 2. After the loop, 2 is added to `m`.

The `Solver` then enters a while loop that checks if there is more input to read using the `ScanReader` class. The `ScanReader` class is designed to read from an `InputStream` and tokenize the input.

Given the input `2`, the `ScanReader` will read this value and the while loop will execute once. Inside the loop, the value of `m` is printed, which is the product of all numbers from 2 to 1501 (inclusive) plus 2. Then, a for loop runs `n` times (where `n` is the input value 2), printing the numbers 2 and 3 (since the loop starts at 0 and prints `i+2`).

The output will be the value of `m` followed by the numbers 2 and 3 on separate lines.
