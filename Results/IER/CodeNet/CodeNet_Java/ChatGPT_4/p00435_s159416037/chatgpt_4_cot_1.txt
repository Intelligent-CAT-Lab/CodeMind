The input string "MRL" is converted to a character array `arr` with the characters {'M', 'R', 'L'}.
The program then enters a for loop that iterates over each character in the array.

For each character, the program performs a Caesar cipher decryption with a left shift of 3 positions. The formula used is:
`(arr[i] - 'A' - 3 + 26) % 26 + 'A'`

Let's decrypt each character step by step:
1. 'M' -> (77 - 65 - 3 + 26) % 26 + 65 = (35) % 26 + 65 = 9 + 65 = 74 -> 'J'
2. 'R' -> (82 - 65 - 3 + 26) % 26 + 65 = (40) % 26 + 65 = 14 + 65 = 79 -> 'O'
3. 'L' -> (76 - 65 - 3 + 26) % 26 + 65 = (34) % 26 + 65 = 8 + 65 = 73 -> 'I'

After the loop, the array `arr` contains the characters {'J', 'O', 'I'}.
The program then prints the array as a string, which will output "JOI".
