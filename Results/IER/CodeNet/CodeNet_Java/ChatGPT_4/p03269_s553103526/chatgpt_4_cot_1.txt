The input is `4`. The variable `l` is initialized with the value 4.

The code initializes an array of lists `edges` to hold `Edge` objects, which represent edges in a graph with a `to` node and a `cost`. The graph has 21 nodes (indexed from 0 to 20).

A for loop is used to add a default edge from each node `i` (from 1 to 19) to the node `i+1` with a cost of 0.

An array `ika` is initialized to store the cumulative cost to reach each node from node 20 by only moving to adjacent nodes with a cost of 0.

A nested for loop is used to add additional edges to the graph. It starts from node 19 and goes down to node 1. For each node `i`, it checks if adding an edge from `i` to `i+1` with a cost of `1<<(19-i)` would result in a cumulative cost less than `l`. If so, it adds the edge. Otherwise, it adds edges from the current node `v` to all higher nodes `j` with a cost that is the current maximum cost plus 1, as long as the cumulative cost is less than `l`.

After the loop, the code calculates the total number of edges in the graph by summing the sizes of the lists in `edges`.

Finally, the code prints the number of nodes (which is 20) and the total number of edges, followed by the details of each edge (the starting node, the ending node, and the cost).

Given the input `4`, the code will add the default edges from each node `i` to `i+1` with a cost of 0. Since `l` is 4, the additional edges added will be minimal because the cumulative cost must not exceed `l`.

Let's step through the loop:
- For `i = 19`, `ika[20]` is 0, so `edges[19]` will have an edge to `20` with a cost of `1<<(19-19)` which is 1.
- For `i = 18`, `ika[19]` is 1, so `edges[18]` will have an edge to `19` with a cost of `1<<(19-18)` which is 2.
- For `i = 17`, `ika[18]` is 3, so `edges[17]` will not add an edge to `18` with a cost of `1<<(19-17)` which is 4 because `4 + 3` is not less than `l`.

The loop breaks, and no more additional edges are added.

The output will be the number of nodes (20), the total number of edges, and the details of each edge.
