<<<Analysis>>>
The code uses a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It wraps the Scanner in a BufferedInputStream for efficiency. The code is structured to continuously read pairs of BigInteger values until there is no more input available.

The input provided is "5 8". The Scanner reads these two values as BigIntegers and assigns them to variables a and b, respectively.

The code then calculates the result of subtracting b from a using the subtract method of the BigInteger class. Since a is 5 and b is 8, the subtraction result is -3.

The result of the subtraction is then printed to the standard output.

After printing the result, the code would normally continue to look for the next pair of BigIntegers, but since there is no more input, the while loop will terminate, and the Scanner will be closed.

<<<Output>>>
-3
