<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "bac" is converted to a character array s[] with the characters 'b', 'a', 'c'.
A boolean array abc[] of size 3 is created to keep track of the presence of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

The for loop iterates over the first three characters of the array s[].
- In the first iteration, i = 0, s[0] is 'b', so abc[1] is set to true.
- In the second iteration, i = 1, s[1] is 'a', so abc[0] is set to true.
- In the third iteration, i = 2, s[2] is 'c', so abc[2] is set to true.

After the loop, all elements of the abc[] array are true, indicating that 'a', 'b', and 'c' are all present in the input.

Another for loop checks if all values in abc[] are true by using the &= operator on the isOK variable, which starts as true.
- After the loop, isOK remains true because all elements in abc[] are true.

Finally, the ternary operator checks if isOK is true and prints "Yes" if it is, otherwise it would print "No".

Since isOK is true, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
