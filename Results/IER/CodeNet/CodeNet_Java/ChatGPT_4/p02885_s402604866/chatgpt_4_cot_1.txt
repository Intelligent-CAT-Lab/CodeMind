<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two integers, yoko and a, from the input. The input provided is "12 4", so yoko is set to 12 and a is set to 4.

The variable sum is initialized to 0. The code then checks if the expression (yoko - 2*a) is greater than 0. In this case, (12 - 2*4) equals 4, which is greater than 0. Therefore, sum is set to the result of the expression, which is 4.

The Scanner object is then closed to prevent resource leaks, and the value of sum is printed to the standard output.

The output will be the value of sum, which is 4.
