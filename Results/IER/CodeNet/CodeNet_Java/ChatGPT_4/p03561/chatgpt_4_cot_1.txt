<<<Analysis>>>
The input `3 2` initializes the variables k and n with the values 3 and 2, respectively. The `Solver` class is then instantiated with these values.

The `solve` method of the `Solver` class is called, which checks the value of k. Since k is 3, which is odd, the `solveKOdd` method is called.

In the `solveKOdd` method, an array `digits` of size n (which is 2) is created and filled with the value (k + 1) / 2, which is 2. So, the `digits` array initially is [2, 2].

The `decrement` method is called n / 2 times, which is 1 time in this case. The `decrement` method will decrease the last non-zero digit of the `digits` array by 1 and reset all subsequent digits to k if they are greater than 1. Since the last digit is 2, it will be decremented to 1, and the `digits` array becomes [2, 1].

After the loop, a `List<Integer> answers` is created, and the non-zero values from the `digits` array are added to this list. The `digits` array is [2, 1], so the `answers` list will be [2, 1].

The `execute` method then prints each element of the `answers` list on a new line using the `PrintWriter` object `out`.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the `answers` list printed on separate lines, which are 2 and 1.
