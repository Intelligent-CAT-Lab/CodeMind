<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three integer variables a, b, and c with the values 2, 4, and 6 respectively according to the input. It then initializes a String variable result with the value "NO".
The code checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between c and b. In this case, 4 - 2 equals 2 and 6 - 4 also equals 2, which means the condition is true.
Since the condition is true, the code sets the value of result to "YES".
Finally, the code prints the value of result, which is "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
