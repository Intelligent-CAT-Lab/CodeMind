<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `solve` method, a `gcd` (Greatest Common Divisor) method, and an `InputReader` class to handle input.

The `main` method creates an instance of `InputReader` to read from `System.in` and a `PrintWriter` to write to `System.out`. It then calls the `solve` method and flushes the output.

The `solve` method reads an integer `p` using `ir.nextInt()`. If `p` is 0, it prints 2 and exits the program. Since `p` is 1 in the input, it continues to read the next integer `q`, which is 2.

It then calculates `a` as `q / gcd(p, q)`. The `gcd` method is called with `p` and `q` as arguments, which returns 1 because the greatest common divisor of 1 and 2 is 1. Therefore, `a` is calculated as `2 / 1`, which is 2.

The `solve` method then initializes `ret` to 1 and enters a for loop starting from `i = 2`. The loop continues as long as `a` is greater than 1. Inside the loop, it checks if `a` is divisible by `i`. If not, it continues to the next iteration. If it is divisible, it multiplies `ret` by `i` and divides `a` by `i` until `a` is no longer divisible by `i`.

In this case, `a` is 2, which is divisible by `i = 2`. So `ret` becomes `1 * 2 = 2`, and `a` becomes `2 / 2 = 1`. The loop then exits because `a` is no longer greater than 1.

Finally, the `solve` method prints the value of `ret`, which is 2.
