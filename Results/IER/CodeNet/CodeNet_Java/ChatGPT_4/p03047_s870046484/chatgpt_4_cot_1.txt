<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in).
It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input. According to the given input, a is assigned the value 3 and b is assigned the value 2.
The code calculates the value of ans by subtracting (b - 1) from a. This is equivalent to a - b + 1.
Substituting the values of a and b, we get ans = 3 - (2 - 1) = 3 - 1 = 2.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
