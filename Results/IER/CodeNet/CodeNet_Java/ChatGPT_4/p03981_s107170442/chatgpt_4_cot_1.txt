<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "abcabc". The code is designed to find the maximum number of distinct substrings that can be created from the input string when considering all possible suffixes and their longest common prefixes (LCP).

1. The `SuffixArray` class is used to create a suffix array and calculate the LCP array for the input string.
2. The `UnionFind` class is used to keep track of the connected components (groups of indices) in the suffix array that have a common prefix of a certain length.
3. The `InputReader` class is used to read the input from the system input stream.

The main steps of the code execution are as follows:

- The `SuffixArray` object `sa` is created with the input string converted to a character array.
- The suffix array and LCP array are built using `sa.buildSA()` and `sa.buildLCP()`.
- The variable `n` is set to the length of the input string plus one.
- A `UnionFind` object `uf` is created to manage the union-find structure for `n` elements.
- Two arrays, `sapo` and `lcpo`, are created to store the suffix array positions and LCP values with their original indices.
- Both arrays are sorted: `sapo` by the suffix array positions and `lcpo` by the LCP values in descending order.
- The main loop iterates over each suffix array position, decrementing `L` and incrementing `cnt` each time.
- Inside the loop, while the current LCP value is greater than or equal to `L`, the code unites the positions in the union-find structure and decrements `cnt` if they were not already in the same set.
- The variable `max` is updated to keep track of the maximum value of `cnt`.

The output of the program is the maximum number of distinct substrings that can be created, which corresponds to the maximum value of `cnt` found during the iteration.

Given the input "abcabc", the suffix array and LCP array would be as follows:
Suffix Array: [6, 5, 3, 0, 4, 2, 1]
LCP Array: [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 1]

The maximum number of distinct substrings is calculated based on the LCP values and the union-find structure. The output will be the maximum number of distinct substrings that can be created from the input string.
