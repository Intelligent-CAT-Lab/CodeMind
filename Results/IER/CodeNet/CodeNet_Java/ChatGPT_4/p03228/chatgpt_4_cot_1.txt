<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with 5 and 4 respectively according to the input. The variable op is initialized with 2.

The for loop will iterate 2 times because op is 2.

In the first iteration (i=0), since i is even, the following operations occur:
- b is increased by half of a, so b becomes 4 + (5 / 2) = 4 + 2 = 6.
- a is halved, so a becomes 5 / 2 = 2 (since it's an integer division, the result is truncated).

In the second iteration (i=1), since i is odd, the following operations occur:
- a is increased by half of b, so a becomes 2 + (6 / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5.
- b is halved, so b becomes 6 / 2 = 3.

After the loop finishes, the program prints the final values of a and b, which are 5 and 3 respectively.
