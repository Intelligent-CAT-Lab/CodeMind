<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads three integers a, b, and c from the input, which are 5, 7, and 9 respectively according to the given input.
It checks if the sum of a, b, and c is greater than or equal to 22. In this case, 5 + 7 + 9 equals 21, which is not greater than or equal to 22.
Since the condition (a+b+c >= 22) is not met, the code will execute the else block and print "win".
<<<Output>>>
win
