<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `2`, which is assigned to the variable `n` in the `solve` method of the `TaskC` class.

The `solve` method calculates a result `res` initialized to 1 and then multiplies it by 3 `n` times, which in this case is 2 times. So `res` becomes 3^2 = 9.

Next, the method calculates a value `p2` initialized to 2 and enters a loop that will iterate `n/2` times, which is 1 time for `n = 2`.

Inside the loop, the method calculates a subtraction from `res` using the formula:
`res - facts[n] * invfacts[na] * invfacts[n - na] * p2 % MODULO`
where `facts` is an array of factorials modulo `MODULO`, `invfacts` is an array of modular multiplicative inverses of factorials modulo `MODULO`, and `p2` is a power of 2.

For `na = 0` (the only iteration):
- `facts[n]` is `facts[2]` which is 2 (since `facts[0] = 1` and `facts[1] = 1`, then `facts[2] = facts[1] * 2 % MODULO` which is 2).
- `invfacts[na]` is `invfacts[0]` which is 1.
- `invfacts[n - na]` is `invfacts[2]` which is the modular inverse of 2 modulo `MODULO`.
- `p2` is 2.

The subtraction part becomes:
`res - 2 * 1 * invfacts[2] * 2 % MODULO`
Since `invfacts[2]` is the modular inverse of 2 modulo `MODULO`, `invfacts[2] * 2 % MODULO` is 1.
So the subtraction part simplifies to:
`res - 2 * 1 * 1 * 2 % MODULO`
which is:
`res - 4 % MODULO`

Subtracting this from `res` (which was 9) gives:
`9 - 4 % MODULO` which is `5 % MODULO`.

Since `5` is less than `MODULO`, the result is just `5`.

Finally, the result `res` is checked to ensure it is not negative, and since it is not, the result `5` is printed.
