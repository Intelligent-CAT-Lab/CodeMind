<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "erasedream" is assigned to the variable S. The code then sequentially replaces occurrences of "eraser", "erase", "dreamer", and "dream" with an empty string in the given order.

1. "eraser" is not found in "erasedream", so the string remains unchanged.
2. "erase" is found and replaced with "", resulting in the string "dream".
3. "dreamer" is not found in "dream", so the string remains unchanged.
4. "dream" is found and replaced with "", resulting in an empty string "".

After all replacements, the length of the resulting string is checked. Since the length is 0, the program prints "YES" indicating that the original string can be constructed by concatenating the words "eraser", "erase", "dreamer", and "dream" in some order.

<<<Output>>>
YES
