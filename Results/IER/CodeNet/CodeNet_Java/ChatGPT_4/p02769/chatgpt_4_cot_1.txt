<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3 2`, which means `n = 3` and `k = 2`. The `solve` method checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. Since `k` is not greater than or equal to `n`, it proceeds to the else block.

The `gen` method is called to generate the factorial (`fact`) and factorial inverse (`factinv`) arrays for numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive). The modulus `mod` is set to `1000000007`.

The `gen` method calculates the factorial of each number from 0 to `n` and stores it in the `fact` array. It also calculates the modular inverse of each factorial using the `Maths.power` method and stores it in the `factinv` array.

After generating the factorials and their inverses, the `solve` method initializes `ans` to 0 and enters a for loop that iterates from `i = 0` to `i = k` (inclusive).

For each iteration, it calculates the following:
- `up` as the product of `fact[n]` and `fact[n - 1]`, modulo `mod`.
- `den1` as the product of `factinv[i]` and `factinv[i]`, modulo `mod`.
- `den2` as the product of `factinv[n - i]` and `factinv[n - i - 1]`, modulo `mod`.
- `den` as the product of `den1` and `den2`, modulo `mod`.

Then it adds the product of `up` and `den` to `ans`, modulo `mod`.

The loop runs for `i = 0`, `i = 1`, and `i = 2`. The calculations are as follows:

For `i = 0`:
- `up = fact[3] * fact[2] % mod = 6 * 2 % mod = 12 % mod`
- `den1 = factinv[0] * factinv[0] % mod = 1 * 1 % mod = 1 % mod`
- `den2 = factinv[3] * factinv[2] % mod = 1 * 1 % mod = 1 % mod`
- `den = den1 * den2 % mod = 1 * 1 % mod = 1 % mod`
- `ans += up * den % mod = 0 + 12 * 1 % mod = 12 % mod`

For `i = 1`:
- `up = fact[3] * fact[2] % mod = 6 * 2 % mod = 12 % mod`
- `den1 = factinv[1] * factinv[1] % mod = 1 * 1 % mod = 1 % mod`
- `den2 = factinv[2] * factinv[1] % mod = 1 * 1 % mod = 1 % mod`
- `den = den1 * den2 % mod = 1 * 1 % mod = 1 % mod`
- `ans += up * den % mod = 12 + 12 * 1 % mod = 24 % mod`

For `i = 2`:
- `up = fact[3] * fact[2] % mod = 6 * 2 % mod = 12 % mod`
- `den1 = factinv[2] * factinv[2] % mod = 1 * 1 % mod = 1 % mod`
- `den2 = factinv[1] * factinv[0] % mod = 1 * 1 % mod = 1 % mod`
- `den = den1 * den2 % mod = 1 * 1 % mod = 1 % mod`
- `ans += up * den % mod = 24 + 12 * 1 % mod = 36 % mod`

Finally, the method prints the value of `ans`, which is `36`.
