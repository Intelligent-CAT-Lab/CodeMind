<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `solve` method that takes an instance of `FastScanner`, `PrintWriter`, and `Methods`. The `solve` method is where the main logic of the program resides.

The `FastScanner` class is a custom scanner class that reads input from the `System.in` input stream. It provides methods to read different types of data from the input stream, such as `nextInt`, `nextLong`, `nextDouble`, etc.

The `Methods` class contains utility methods that are not used in the `solve` method for this particular input.

The `solve` method reads three integers `h`, `lower`, and `upper` from the input, which are 100, 2, and 4 respectively. It then initializes an integer `ans` to 0.

The method enters a for loop that iterates from `lower` (2) to `upper` (4) inclusive. For each integer `i` in this range, it checks if `h` (100) is divisible by `i` without a remainder (`h % i == 0`). If it is, it increments `ans` by 1.

The loop will check the following:
- For `i = 2`, `100 % 2 == 0` is true, so `ans` is incremented to 1.
- For `i = 3`, `100 % 3 == 0` is false, so `ans` remains 1.
- For `i = 4`, `100 % 4 == 0` is true, so `ans` is incremented to 2.

After the loop, the method prints the value of `ans` (2) to the output using `out.println(ans)`.

Finally, the `main` method creates instances of `FastScanner` and `PrintWriter`, calls the `solve` method with these instances and an instance of `Methods`, and then closes the scanner and the writer.

Based on this analysis, the output of the code execution with the input `100 2 4` will be 2, as there are two numbers between 2 and 4 (inclusive) that divide 100 without a remainder.
