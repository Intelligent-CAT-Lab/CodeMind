<<<Analysis>>>
The input `33` is read and stored in the variable `x`. The `solve` method is then called.

A `HashMap` named `powMap` is created to store the power of 2 raised to the 5th power and its corresponding base value. The map is initialized with two entries: `0 -> 0` and `1 -> 1`.

The `while` loop starts with `base` set to 2 and `beforePow` set to 1. The loop calculates `2^5`, which is `32`, and adds it to the `powMap` with `32 -> 2`. Since `32 - 1` is not greater than `x` (33), the loop continues.

The `base` is incremented to 3, and `3^5` (243) is calculated and added to the `powMap` with `243 -> 3`. Now, `243 - 32` is greater than `x` (33), so the loop breaks.

The program then iterates over the entries in `powMap`. For each entry, it calculates the absolute difference between `x` (33) and the power value (`powVal`). It checks if this difference exists as a key in `powMap`.

When it checks the entry `32 -> 2`, the difference `33 - 32` is `1`, which is a key in `powMap`. Therefore, it prints the base corresponding to `32`, which is `2`, and since `32 - 33` is negative, it prints the base corresponding to the difference `1` with a minus sign, which is `-1`.

After printing `2 -1`, the program returns and does not print anything else.

2 -1
