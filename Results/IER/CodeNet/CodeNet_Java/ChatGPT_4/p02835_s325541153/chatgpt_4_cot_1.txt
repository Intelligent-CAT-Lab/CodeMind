<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c. The input provided is `5 7 9`, so a=5, b=7, and c=9.
It then checks if the sum of a, b, and c is greater than or equal to 22. In this case, the sum is 5+7+9=21.
Since 21 is not greater than or equal to 22, the condition (a+b+c)>=22 is false.
Therefore, the code will execute the else block and print "win".
<<<Output>>>
win
