The variable N is initialized with 10 according to the input. The boolean variable f is initialized with false.
It enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to 9 to check each integer A in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if N is divisible by A and if the result of the division of N by A is less than 10.
For the given input 10, when A is 1, the condition (10 % 1 == 0 && 10 / 1 < 10) is false because 10 / 1 is not less than 10.
When A is 2, the condition (10 % 2 == 0 && 10 / 2 < 10) is true because 10 is divisible by 2 and 10 / 2 is 5, which is less than 10.
Since the condition is met, the variable f is set to true and the loop can continue to check other values of A, but the value of f will remain true.
After the loop finishes, the ternary operator checks the value of f and assigns "Yes" to the variable ret if f is true, otherwise it assigns "No".
Finally, the program prints the value of ret, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
