<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a method called `solution` which takes two integers `x` and `y` as parameters. It checks if the sum of `x` and `y` is even by using the modulus operator `%`. If the sum is even, it prints the average of `x` and `y` by dividing the sum by 2. If the sum is odd, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".

In the `main` method, a `Scanner` object is created to read input from the user. Two integers `x` and `y` are read from the input, which are 2 and 16 respectively. The `solution` method is then called with these two integers.

The sum of `x` and `y` is 2 + 16 = 18, which is an even number. Therefore, the condition `(x+y)%2==0` is true. The program then calculates the average, which is (2+16)/2 = 18/2 = 9.

The output of the code will be the average of `x` and `y`, which is 9.
