<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 105 according to the input. The variables cnt and temp are initialized with 0.
The code enters a for loop that iterates over all odd numbers from 1 to 105 (inclusive). For each odd number i, it enters another for loop to count the number of divisors that i has.
The inner for loop iterates from 1 to i and checks if i is divisible by j (i % j == 0). If it is, temp is incremented by 1.
After the inner loop finishes, the code checks if temp is equal to 8. If it is, it means that the current odd number i has exactly 8 divisors, and cnt is incremented by 1.
After checking the condition, temp is reset to 0 for the next iteration of the outer loop.
Once the outer loop finishes, the code prints the value of cnt, which represents the total number of odd numbers up to N that have exactly 8 divisors.
The odd numbers up to 105 that have exactly 8 divisors are 15, 21, 35, 55, 77, and 105. Therefore, cnt should be 6 after the loop finishes.
<<<Output>>>
6
