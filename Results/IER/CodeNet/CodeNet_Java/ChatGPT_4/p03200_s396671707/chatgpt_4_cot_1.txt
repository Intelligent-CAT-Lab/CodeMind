<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the string "BBW". The variables ans and count are initialized with 0, and the boolean variable b is initialized with false.
The for loop iterates over each character of the string S.

1. In the first iteration (i = 0), the character at index 0 is 'B'. The condition c == 'W' is false, so it checks the else if condition c == 'B', which is true. It sets b to true and continues to the next iteration.

2. In the second iteration (i = 1), the character at index 1 is 'B' again. The condition c == 'W' is false, so it checks the else if condition c == 'B', which is true. However, since b is already true, nothing changes, and it continues to the next iteration.

3. In the third iteration (i = 2), the character at index 2 is 'W'. The condition c == 'W' is true, and since b is also true (from previous iterations), it executes the code inside the if block. It calculates ans += i - count, which is ans += 2 - 0, so ans becomes 2. Then it increments count by 1, so count becomes 1.

After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output, which is 2.
