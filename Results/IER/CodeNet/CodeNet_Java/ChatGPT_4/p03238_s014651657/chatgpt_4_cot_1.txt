<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads an integer value into variable 'a'. The input provided is '1', so 'a' is set to 1.

The code then checks if 'a' is equal to 1. Since 'a' is indeed 1, the condition is true, and the code inside the if block is executed. The program prints "Hello World" to the standard output.

Since the else block is only executed if 'a' is not equal to 1, and in this case 'a' is 1, the else block is skipped. Therefore, the program does not read any more input or perform any additional calculations.

The program does not have any more statements to execute after the if-else block, so it finishes execution after printing "Hello World".
<<<Output>>>
Hello World
