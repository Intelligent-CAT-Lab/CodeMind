<<<Analysis>>>
The code is a Java program that implements a simple Caesar cipher decryption with a left shift of 3. The input string 'MRL' is expected to be an encrypted text, and the program will decrypt it by shifting each letter 3 positions to the left in the alphabet.

The program starts by initializing a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then defines an array 'alpha' containing all uppercase letters of the English alphabet.

The input string 'MRL' is read and converted to a character array 'inChar'.

The program then enters a nested loop to decrypt each character of the input. For each character in 'inChar', it searches for the corresponding index in the 'alpha' array. Once found, it calculates the new index by shifting 3 positions to the left. If the index is less than 3, it wraps around to the end of the alphabet using the expression (26-(3-j)). Otherwise, it simply subtracts 3 from the index.

The decrypted characters are stored back into 'inChar'.

After the loop, the program concatenates the decrypted characters into a string 'ans' and prints it out.

Let's decrypt the input 'MRL':
- 'M' is found at index 12 in 'alpha'. Shifting 3 positions to the left, we get index 9, which corresponds to 'J'.
- 'R' is found at index 17 in 'alpha'. Shifting 3 positions to the left, we get index 14, which corresponds to 'O'.
- 'L' is found at index 11 in 'alpha'. Shifting 3 positions to the left, we get index 8, which corresponds to 'I'.

Therefore, the decrypted string is 'JOI'.
