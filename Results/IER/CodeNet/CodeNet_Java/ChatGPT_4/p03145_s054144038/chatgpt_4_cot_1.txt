The code is designed to calculate the area of a right-angled triangle. The variables a, b, and c are intended to represent the lengths of the sides of the triangle, with a and b being the lengths of the two legs and c being the length of the hypotenuse. However, the value of c is not used in the calculation.

The Scanner object `sc` is used to read three integers from the input. According to the input provided, the values of a, b, and c are set to 3, 4, and 5, respectively.

The area of a right-angled triangle is given by the formula (base * height) / 2. In this code, the base and height are represented by a and b, respectively. Therefore, the area is calculated as (3 * 4) / 2.

The calculation proceeds as follows:
- a * b = 3 * 4 = 12
- 12 / 2 = 6

The result of the calculation, which is 6, is then printed to the console.
