<<<Analysis>>>
The input is read and split into three parts: `w`, `h`, and `c`, which are initialized with 10, 20, and 5 respectively. The `gcd` (Greatest Common Divisor) of `w` and `h` is calculated using the `gcd` function. The `gcd` function uses a recursive approach to find the greatest common divisor of `w` and `h`. 

The `gcd` of 10 and 20 is calculated as follows:
- gcd(10, 20) calls gcd(20, 10 % 20) which is gcd(20, 10).
- gcd(20, 10) calls gcd(10, 20 % 10) which is gcd(10, 0).
- Since the second argument is now 0, the function returns the first argument, which is 10.

So, the `gcd` of 10 and 20 is 10.

Next, the code calculates `gw` and `gh` by dividing `w` and `h` by the `gcd`, which results in `gw = 10 / 10 = 1` and `gh = 20 / 10 = 2`.

The fee is then calculated by multiplying `gw`, `gh`, and `c`: `fee = (1 * 2) * 5 = 10`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `fee`, which is 10.
