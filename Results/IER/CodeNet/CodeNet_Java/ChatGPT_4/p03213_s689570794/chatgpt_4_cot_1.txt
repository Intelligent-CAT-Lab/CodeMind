<<<Analysis>>>
The input N is initialized with 9. The array primaryNumbers contains the first 25 prime numbers.

A HashMap map is created to store the count of how many times each prime number can divide numbers up to N.

The first for loop iterates over the array of prime numbers. For each prime number, it initializes its count in the map to 0. Then, it calculates how many times each prime number can divide numbers up to N, including its powers, and updates the count in the map. For example, for the prime number 2, it can divide numbers up to 9 a total of 4 times (2, 4, 8, and 16, but 16 is greater than 9, so it's not counted). This is done for all prime numbers in the array.

The next four for loops are used to count the number of combinations that satisfy certain conditions based on the counts of prime numbers in the map.

The first nested for loop counts combinations where two prime numbers are raised to the power of 4 and one prime number is raised to the power of 2. However, since the highest count for any prime number up to 9 is 4 (for the prime number 2), and all other prime numbers have a count less than 4, this loop does not increment the count.

The second nested for loop counts combinations where one prime number is raised to the power of 24 and another prime number is raised to the power of 2. Again, since no prime number has a count of 24 or higher, this loop does not increment the count.

The third nested for loop counts combinations where one prime number is raised to the power of 14 and another prime number is raised to the power of 4. Similarly, no prime number has a count of 14 or higher, so this loop does not increment the count.

The last for loop counts the number of prime numbers that are raised to the power of 74. Since no prime number has a count of 74 or higher, this loop does not increment the count.

Since none of the loops increment the count, the final value of count remains 0.

Finally, the program prints the value of count, which is 0.
