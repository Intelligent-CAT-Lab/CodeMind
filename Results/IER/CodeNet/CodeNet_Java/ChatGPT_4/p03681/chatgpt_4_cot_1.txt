<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 2` initializes the variables n and m both with the value 2. The code then checks if n is greater than m and if so, swaps their values, but since n and m are equal, no swapping occurs.

Next, the code checks if the difference between m and n is greater than 1. If it is, the program would print 0 and return. However, since m and n are equal, this condition is not met, and the program continues.

The program then initializes a variable ans with the value 1 and enters two for loops. The first loop runs from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), and the second loop runs from 0 to m-1 (inclusive). In each iteration, the loop multiplies ans by i+1 and takes the result modulo 1e9 + 7. This effectively calculates the factorial of n and m modulo 1e9 + 7.

Since n and m are both 2, the loops calculate 2! (factorial of 2) twice. The calculation is as follows:
- First loop: ans = 1 * 1 = 1, then ans = 1 * 2 = 2
- Second loop: ans = 2 * 1 = 2, then ans = 2 * 2 = 4

After the loops, the code checks if m equals n. Since they are equal, the program multiplies ans by 2 and takes the result modulo 1e9 + 7. Therefore, ans = 4 * 2 = 8.

Finally, the program prints the value of ans, which is 8.
