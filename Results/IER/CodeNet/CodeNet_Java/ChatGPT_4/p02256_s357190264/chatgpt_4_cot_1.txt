The input provided is `54 20`. The variables x and y are initialized with 54 and 20 respectively. An instance of the Main class is created, and the gcd method is called with x and y as arguments.

The gcd method is a recursive method that implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The method is called as follows:

1. gcd(54, 20)
   - Since y is not 0, it calls gcd(20, 54 % 20) which is gcd(20, 14).
2. gcd(20, 14)
   - Since y is not 0, it calls gcd(14, 20 % 14) which is gcd(14, 6).
3. gcd(14, 6)
   - Since y is not 0, it calls gcd(6, 14 % 6) which is gcd(6, 2).
4. gcd(6, 2)
   - Since y is not 0, it calls gcd(2, 6 % 2) which is gcd(2, 0).
5. gcd(2, 0)
   - Since y is 0, it returns x, which is 2.

The final return value of the gcd method is 2, which is the greatest common divisor of 54 and 20. This value is printed to the console.
