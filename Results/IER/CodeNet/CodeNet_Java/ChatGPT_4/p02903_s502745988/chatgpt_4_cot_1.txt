<<<Analysis>>>
The variables h, w, a, and b are initialized with 3, 3, 1, and 1 respectively according to the input. A StringBuilder object sb is created to build the output string.

The first for loop runs for b times, which is 1 in this case. It appends "0" a times (which is 1) and "1" (w-a) times (which is 2) to the StringBuilder, followed by a line separator. This results in a single line of "011".

The second for loop runs for (h-b) times, which is 2 in this case. It appends "1" a times (which is 1) and "0" (w-a) times (which is 2) to the StringBuilder, followed by a line separator. This results in two lines of "100".

After both loops finish, the StringBuilder contains the string "011\n100\n100\n", which is then printed to the console.

<<<Output>>>
011
100
