<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided initializes the variables x1, y1, x2, and y2 with 0, 0, 0, and 1 respectively.

The code calculates the differences a and b between the x and y coordinates of the two points, which results in a = 0 and b = 1.

Next, it calculates the coordinates for the third point (x3, y3) by subtracting b from x2 and adding a to y2, resulting in x3 = 0 - 1 = -1 and y3 = 1 + 0 = 1.

Then, it calculates the coordinates for the fourth point (x4, y4) by subtracting a from x3 and b from y3, resulting in x4 = -1 - 0 = -1 and y4 = 1 - 1 = 0.

Finally, the code prints the coordinates of the third and fourth points in the format "x3 y3 x4 y4", which will be "-1 1 -1 0".

<<<Output>>>
-1 1 -1 0
