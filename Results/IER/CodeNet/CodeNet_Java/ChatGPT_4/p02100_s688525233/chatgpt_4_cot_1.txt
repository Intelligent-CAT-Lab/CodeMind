<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `x^2+3x+2` is processed by the `decompose` method after being prefixed with "1" and suffixed with "x^0". The `decompose` method performs several replacements to normalize the polynomial string and then splits it into terms. Each term is further split into coefficient and exponent, and the coefficients are stored in an array `e` in reverse order of their exponents.

The `solve` method then enters a loop to find the roots of the polynomial by testing values from -2000 to 2000. The `ok` method checks if a given value is a root by evaluating the polynomial at that value and checking if the result is zero.

For the input `x^2+3x+2`, the `decompose` method will create an array `e` with the values [1, 3, 2]. The loop in `solve` will find that -1 and -2 are roots of the polynomial because `ok(e, -1)` and `ok(e, -2)` will return true. These roots are added to the `ans` list as 1 and 2, respectively.

After finding the roots, the `ans` list is sorted and the roots are formatted as factors of the polynomial in the form `(x+d)` where `d` is the root. The `out` object prints the formatted factors.

The final output will be the factors of the polynomial `x^2+3x+2` which are `(x+1)` and `(x+2)`.
