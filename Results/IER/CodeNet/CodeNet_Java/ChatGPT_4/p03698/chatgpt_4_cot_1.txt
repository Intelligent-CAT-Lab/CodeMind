<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "uncopyrightable" is read and split into individual characters to form a list of strings, inputString. The characters are: ['u', 'n', 'c', 'o', 'p', 'y', 'r', 'i', 'g', 'h', 't', 'a', 'b', 'l', 'e'].

A HashSet removeDuplication is created to store unique characters from the inputString. As a Set does not allow duplicate values, any duplicate characters in the inputString will be ignored.

The for loop iterates over each character in the inputString and adds it to the removeDuplication set. Since the input string "uncopyrightable" has no repeating characters, all characters will be added to the set without any being ignored.

After the loop, the program checks if the size of the inputString list is equal to the size of the removeDuplication set. If they are equal, it means there were no duplicate characters in the inputString, and the answer is set to "yes". Otherwise, the answer would be "no".

In this case, since "uncopyrightable" has no repeating characters, the sizes will match, and the answer will be "yes".

<<<Output>>>
yes
