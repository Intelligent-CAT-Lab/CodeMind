<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. The variable count is initialized with 0, and a StringBuilder sb is created to build the output string.

The code enters a nested for loop where the outer loop variable i iterates from 1 to n-1 (1 to 2 in this case), and the inner loop variable j iterates from i+1 to n (2 to 3 when i is 1).

Inside the inner loop, the code checks if n is even or odd. Since n is 3, which is odd, the code checks if i + j equals n. If it does, it continues to the next iteration without executing the following statements.

For i = 1 and j = 2, i + j equals 3, which is equal to n. Therefore, the continue statement is executed, and the loop moves to the next iteration without appending anything to sb or incrementing count.

Since there are no other possible pairs (i, j) that satisfy the loop conditions, the loop ends.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of count, which is 0, and then prints the content of sb, which is empty.

<<<Output>>>
0
