<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value 'n' from the input, which in this case is 117.

The integer 'n' is then converted to a String object 'string' using the String.valueOf method. The resulting string is "117".

Next, the code checks if the string "117" contains the character "7" using the contains method of the String class. Since "117" does indeed contain "7", the condition in the ternary operator (string.contains("7") ? "Yes" : "No") evaluates to true.

Therefore, the code prints "Yes" to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
