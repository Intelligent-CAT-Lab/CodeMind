<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input, multiplies them, and checks if the product is even or odd. It then prints "Even" if the product is even, and "Odd" if the product is odd.

The input provided is `3 4`. The code multiplies these two numbers, resulting in 12. Since 12 is an even number (because it is divisible by 2), the condition `12 % 2 == 0` evaluates to true. Therefore, the code will output "Even".

<<<Output>>>
Even
