<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by reading two integers, k and x, from the input, which are 3 and 7 respectively. It then creates an empty ArrayList of Integers called integers.

The getMinCoodinate method is called with integers, k, and x as arguments. This method adds k-1 integers to the list, incrementing x each time. Since k is 3, it will add two numbers to the list: 8 and 9.

Next, the integer x itself is added to the list, which is 7.

Then, the getMaxCoodinate method is called with integers, k, and x as arguments. This method adds k-1 integers to the list, decrementing x each time. Since k is 3, it will add two numbers to the list: 6 and 5.

The list now contains the integers 8, 9, 7, 6, and 5.

The list is then sorted, resulting in the integers being ordered as 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Finally, the forEach method is used to print out the integers in the list, separated by spaces, with the last integer followed by a newline. The Consumer implementation keeps track of the index to determine when to print a space or a newline.
