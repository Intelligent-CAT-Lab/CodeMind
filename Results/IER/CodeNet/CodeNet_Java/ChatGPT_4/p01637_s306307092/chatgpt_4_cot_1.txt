<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided `M r` is not valid for the given Java code. The code expects five long integer inputs, but the provided input consists of two characters that do not represent valid long integers. The Scanner object `sc` is used to read long integers from the input, and if the input does not match the expected type, a `java.util.InputMismatchException` will be thrown at runtime.

Since I cannot execute the code, I can only speculate that if this code were to run with the provided input, it would result in an exception due to the input mismatch.

<<<Output>>>
Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException
