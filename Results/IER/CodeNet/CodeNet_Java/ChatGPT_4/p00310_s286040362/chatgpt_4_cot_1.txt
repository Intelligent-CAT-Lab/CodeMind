<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read from the standard input. In the main method, it uses the Scanner to read three integers from the input and immediately prints their sum to the standard output. Given the input `10 10 20`, the Scanner reads these three integers and adds them together, resulting in the sum of 10 + 10 + 20, which equals 40. The result is then printed to the standard output.
<<<Output>>>
40
