<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input. The variable count is initialized with 0.
The code enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the square of the current integer i is less than or equal to n (10). If it is, it increments the count by 1.
The condition i*i <= n is met when i is 1, 2, and 3 because 1*1=1, 2*2=4, and 3*3=9 are all less than or equal to 10. When i is 4, 4*4=16 which is greater than 10, so the loop stops incrementing count.
After the loop finishes, count is 3. The code then prints the square of count, which is 3*3=9.
<<<Output>>>
9
