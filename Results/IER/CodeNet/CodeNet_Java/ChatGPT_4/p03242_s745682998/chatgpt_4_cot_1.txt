<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input and converts it to a string. It then iterates over each character of the string. For each character, it checks if the character is '1'. If it is, it appends '9' to the string 'ans'; otherwise, it appends '1'. This process is done using a ternary operator within the loop.

Given the input '119', the string 'num' will be "119". The for loop will iterate over each character of "119":
- For the first character '1', it will append '9' to 'ans'.
- For the second character '1', it will again append '9' to 'ans'.
- For the third character '9', it will append '1' to 'ans'.

After the loop, 'ans' will be "991". The program then prints 'ans'.
