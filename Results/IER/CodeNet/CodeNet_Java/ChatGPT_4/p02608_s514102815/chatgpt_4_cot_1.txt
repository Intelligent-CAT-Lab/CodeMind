<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `20`, which is assigned to the variable `num`. The code then initializes an array `cnt` of size `num + 1` (21 in this case) with all elements set to 0.

The code then enters a triple nested loop with variables `i`, `j`, and `k`, each ranging from 1 to 299. For each combination of `i`, `j`, and `k`, it calculates the value of `tmp` using the formula `i * i + j * j + k * k + i * j + j * k + k * i`. If `tmp` is less than or equal to `num` (20 in this case), it increments the value of `cnt[tmp]` by 1.

After the loops finish, the code prints the values of `cnt` from index 1 to `num` (20), each on a new line.

The output will be the counts of different values of `tmp` that can be formed by the sum of squares and products of `i`, `j`, and `k` where each of them ranges from 1 to 299 and `tmp` is less than or equal to 20.
