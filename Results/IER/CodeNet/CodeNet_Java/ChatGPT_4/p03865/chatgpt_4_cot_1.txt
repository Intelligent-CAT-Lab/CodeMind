<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "aba". The variable `a` is initialized with the length of the string `s`, which is 3. The boolean variable `flag` is initialized with `true`.

The code then checks if the first and the last character of the string `s` are the same. Since `s.charAt(0)` is 'a' and `s.charAt(a-1)` is also 'a', the condition is true.

Next, it checks if the length of the string `a` is odd (3 % 2 == 1). Since the length is indeed odd, the `flag` is set to `true`.

The final `if` statement checks the value of `flag`. Since `flag` is `true`, the code will print "First".

<<<Output>>>
First
