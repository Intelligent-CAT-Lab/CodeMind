<<<Analysis>>>
The main method initializes a FastScanner object 'in' to read from System.in and a PrintWriter object 'out' to write to System.out. It also creates an instance of the Methods class 'ms'. Then it calls the solve method with 'in', 'out', and 'ms' as arguments.

The solve method reads two integers using the nextInt() method of the FastScanner class. According to the input, the first integer is 2 and the second integer is 0. It then calculates the result by subtracting the second integer from the first and subtracting 1 more, resulting in (2 - 0 - 1), which equals 1.

The result is printed using the println method of the PrintWriter object 'out'. After that, the FastScanner and PrintWriter objects are closed using their respective close methods.
