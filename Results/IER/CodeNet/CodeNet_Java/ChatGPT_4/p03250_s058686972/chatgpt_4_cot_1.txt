<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized with 1, 5, and 2 respectively according to the input. The variable max is initialized with 0.
The code then checks three different combinations of a, b, and c, each time multiplying one of the variables by 10 and adding the other two, to find the maximum sum.

1. For the first if condition, it checks if (a*10 + b + c) is greater than max. In this case, it is (1*10 + 5 + 2) which equals 17. Since 17 is greater than the current max (0), max is updated to 17.

2. For the second if condition, it checks if (a + b*10 + c) is greater than max. In this case, it is (1 + 5*10 + 2) which equals 53. Since 53 is greater than the current max (17), max is updated to 53.

3. For the third if condition, it checks if (a + b + c*10) is greater than max. In this case, it is (1 + 5 + 2*10) which equals 26. Since 26 is not greater than the current max (53), max remains 53.

Finally, the code prints the value of max, which is 53.
<<<Output>>>
53
