<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings using a space as the delimiter. The input `3 8 1` is split into three strings: "3", "8", and "1". These strings are then parsed into integers and assigned to variables a, b, and c respectively.

The values of a, b, and c are then stored in an array named bar at indices 0, 1, and 2 respectively. The array bar now contains the integers 3, 8, and 1.

The code then sorts the array bar in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method. After sorting, the array bar contains the integers 1, 3, and 8 in ascending order.

Finally, the code prints the sorted array elements separated by a space. The output will be the sorted integers in ascending order, which are 1, 3, and 8.
