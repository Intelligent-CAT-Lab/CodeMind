The variable X is initialized with the value 2 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with the value 2.
It enters a for loop which iterates from X down to 1. Since X is 2, the loop will run twice.

In the first iteration (i = 2), the value of ans is updated as follows:
ans = 2 * 2 + 2
ans = 4 + 2
ans = 6

In the second iteration (i = 1), the value of ans is updated again:
ans = 6 * 2 + 2
ans = 12 + 2
ans = 14

After the loop finishes, the final value of ans, which is 14, is printed as the output.
<<<Output>>>
