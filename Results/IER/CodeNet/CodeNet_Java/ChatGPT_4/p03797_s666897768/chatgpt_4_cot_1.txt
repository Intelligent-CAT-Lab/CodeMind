<<<Analysis>>>
The input `1 6` is provided to the program. The `solveC()` method is the one that is called in the `main` method, so we will focus on that.

The `solveC()` method reads two long values from the input, which are `numS` and `numC`. According to the input, `numS` is assigned the value 1 and `numC` is assigned the value 6.

The method then initializes a variable `res` to 0 and checks if `numS` is greater than or equal to `numC`. Since `numS` is 1 and `numC` is 6, this condition is false.

Next, the method calculates `wk` as `numC - (numS * 2)`, which is `6 - (1 * 2)`, resulting in `wk` being 4.

Since `wk` is greater than or equal to 0, the method proceeds to the next if block and calculates `res` as `numS + (wk / 4)`, which is `1 + (4 / 4)`, resulting in `res` being 2.

Finally, the method prints the value of `res`, which is 2.
