<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 0` initializes n with 2 and m with 0. Since m is 0, the array a[] will not be populated and remains empty.

The array b[] is initialized with a size of n, which is 2. Since there are no elements in a[] (because m is 0), no elements in b[] will be set to -1. Therefore, b[] will contain its default values, which for an int array in Java are all zeros: b[] = {0, 0}.

The method rec() is called with the parameters b, 0, and n (which is 2). The method checks if right - left == 2, which is true in this case (2 - 0 == 2). Since neither b[left] nor b[left + 1] are -1 (both are 0), the method returns 1.

Therefore, the output of the program will be 1, which is the result of the rec() method call.
