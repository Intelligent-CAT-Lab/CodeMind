<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer from the input and converts it to a String by concatenating it with an empty string.

The input given is `1222`, which is converted to the String "1222".

The variable rs is initialized to 0. This variable is used to count the occurrences of the character '2' in the string.

The code then enters a for-each loop that iterates over each character in the string. For each character, it checks if the character is '2'. If it is, it increments the rs variable by 1.

In the given input "1222", there are three occurrences of the character '2'. Therefore, the rs variable will be incremented three times.

After the loop, the code prints the value of rs, which is the count of '2's in the input string.
