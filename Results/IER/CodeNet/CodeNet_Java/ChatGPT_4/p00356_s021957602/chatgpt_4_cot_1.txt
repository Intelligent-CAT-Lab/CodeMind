<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized with the value 4 each according to the input. The variables x1 and y1 are also set to the same values as x and y, respectively.

The while loop will execute as long as x1 is not equal to y1. Since both x1 and y1 are initialized with the same value (4), the condition x1 != y1 is false on the first check, and the loop does not execute.

After the loop, the program prints the result of the expression x + y + 1 - x1. Since x, y, and x1 are all 4, the expression evaluates to 4 + 4 + 1 - 4, which equals 5.

<<<Output>>>
5
