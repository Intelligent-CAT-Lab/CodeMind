<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads three integers a, b, and c from the input, which are 50, 100, and 120 respectively according to the given input.

The if statement checks whether the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to c. In this case, it checks if 50 + 100 is greater than or equal to 120. Since 150 is indeed greater than 120, the condition is true.

Therefore, the code will execute the block of code inside the if statement, which is to print "Yes" to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
