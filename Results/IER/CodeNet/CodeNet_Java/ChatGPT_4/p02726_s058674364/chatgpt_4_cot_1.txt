<<<Analysis>>>
The input `5 2 4` initializes the variables n, x, and y with 5, 2, and 4 respectively. The array `ans` is initialized with a size of 5, and all elements are set to 0 by default.

The code then enters a nested loop where i ranges from 1 to n (inclusive) and j ranges from i+1 to n (inclusive). For each pair (i, j), the code calculates three distances:
1. The direct distance between i and j: `Math.abs(i - j)`
2. The distance from i to x, then from y to j, plus 1: `Math.abs(i - x) + Math.abs(j - y) + 1`
3. The distance from i to y, then from x to j, plus 1: `Math.abs(j - x) + Math.abs(i - y) + 1`

The minimum of these three distances is found using `IntMath.min` and used to increment the corresponding index in the `ans` array.

After the nested loops, the code prints the elements of `ans` from index 1 to n-1, each followed by a newline.

Let's calculate the distances for each pair (i, j):
- For (1, 2): direct = 1, via x and y = 4, via y and x = 4, min = 1
- For (1, 3): direct = 2, via x and y = 3, via y and x = 3, min = 2
- For (1, 4): direct = 3, via x and y = 2, via y and x = 4, min = 2
- For (1, 5): direct = 4, via x and y = 3, via y and x = 3, min = 3
- For (2, 3): direct = 1, via x and y = 3, via y and x = 3, min = 1
- For (2, 4): direct = 2, via x and y = 1, via y and x = 3, min = 1
- For (2, 5): direct = 3, via x and y = 2, via y and x = 2, min = 2
- For (3, 4): direct = 1, via x and y = 2, via y and x = 2, min = 1
- For (3, 5): direct = 2, via x and y = 3, via y and x = 1, min = 1
- For (4, 5): direct = 1, via x and y = 4, via y and x = 2, min = 1

Now we increment the `ans` array at the indices corresponding to the minimum distances:
- ans[1] is incremented 5 times (for pairs (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), and (2,4)).
- ans[2] is incremented 3 times (for pairs (1,3), (1,4), and (2,5)).
- ans[3] is incremented 1 time (for pair (1,5)).
- ans[4] is not incremented.

Finally, the code prints the elements of `ans` from index 1 to 4, each followed by a newline:
- ans[1] = 5
- ans[2] = 3
- ans[3] = 1
- ans[4] = 0 (not printed since the loop goes from 1 to n-1)
