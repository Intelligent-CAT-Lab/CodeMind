<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 11 according to the input.
The code then enters a nested for loop where the outer loop variable i iterates from 0 to 14 (since 100/7 is approximately 14) and the inner loop variable j iterates from 0 to 25 (since 100/4 is 25).
In each iteration of the inner loop, the code checks if the current combination of i and j, when multiplied by 7 and 4 respectively and then added together, equals N (which is 11).
The loop checks all combinations of i and j where i is in the range [0, 14] and j is in the range [0, 25]. However, there is no combination of i and j that satisfies the condition (i * 7) + (j * 4) == 11, because 11 cannot be expressed as a sum of multiples of 7 and 4.
After all iterations, since the condition is never met, the code prints "No" and exits.
<<<Output>>>
No
