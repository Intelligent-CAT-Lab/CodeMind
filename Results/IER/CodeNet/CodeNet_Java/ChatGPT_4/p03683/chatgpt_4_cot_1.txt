<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is "2 2", which initializes the variables n and m with the value 2.

The code then checks the absolute difference between n and m:
- If the absolute difference is greater than 1, the result is set to 0.
- If the absolute difference is exactly 1, the result is calculated by calling the factorialsModBillion method with n and m as arguments.
- If n and m are equal (which is the case here), the result is calculated by calling the factorialsModBillion method with n and m as arguments, and then the result is multiplied by 2 and taken modulo 1000000007L.

Since n and m are equal, the third condition is met. The factorialsModBillion method is called with n = 2 and m = 2. The method calculates the factorial of n modulo 1000000007L, which is 2! = 2 * 1 = 2, and then the factorial of m modulo 1000000007L, which is also 2! = 2 * 1 = 2. The result of multiplying these two factorials is 2 * 2 = 4.

The final result is then doubled and taken modulo 1000000007L, which is (4 * 2) % 1000000007L = 8 % 1000000007L = 8.

Therefore, the output of the code execution will be 8.
