<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "erasedream" is passed to the AtCoder class constructor and stored in the variable S.

The solve method is then called, which creates a StringBuilder sb with the reversed string "maerdresae".

The while loop will then iterate as long as the length of sb is greater than 0, checking for specific sequences at the start of the string and deleting them if they match.

1. The first check is for "maerd", which matches the first 5 characters of sb. It deletes these characters, resulting in sb now being "resae".
2. The second check is for "esare", which matches the current sb string exactly. It deletes these characters as well, resulting in sb now being an empty string.

Since the StringBuilder sb is now empty, the loop ends, and the method prints "YES".

<<<Output>>>
YES
