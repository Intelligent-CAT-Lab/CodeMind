<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `main` method that is the entry point of the program. Inside the `main` method, an instance of `Main` is created and its `main` method is called.

The `main` method of the `Main` instance creates a `Scanner` object to read input from `System.in`. It reads two integers, `N` and `M`, from the input.

The code then calculates the product of `N` and `M` and prints the result followed by a newline character. After printing, the `Scanner` object is closed.

The `systemin` `BufferedReader` is also closed at the end of the `main` method of the class.

Given the input `3 4`, the program will read these values into `N` and `M`, calculate their product (3 * 4), and print the result, which is `12`.

<<<Output>>>
12
