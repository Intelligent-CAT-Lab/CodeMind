<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read from standard input. It then reads two integers, K and X, from the input. In this case, K is assigned the value 2 and X is assigned the value 900 based on the given input.

The code then checks if X is less than or equal to 500 multiplied by K. The expression 500*K is evaluated as 500*2, which equals 1000.

Since X (900) is less than 1000, the condition of the if statement is true. Therefore, the code will execute the block inside the if statement and print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
