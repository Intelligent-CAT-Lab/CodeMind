<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with 0 according to the input. The variables x and y are calculated as follows:
x = K % 50, which is 0 % 50, resulting in x = 0.
y = K / 50, which is 0 / 50, resulting in y = 0.

An array a of long integers with a size of 50 is created. A for loop is used to iterate over the indices of the array from 0 to 49. Inside the loop, each element a[i] is set to i + y. Since y is 0, each element a[i] is essentially set to i.

The condition inside the loop checks if i is greater than or equal to 50 - x. Since x is 0, the condition checks if i is greater than or equal to 50, which is never true for any i in the range of 0 to 49. Therefore, the condition inside the loop is never met, and the if statement has no effect.

After the loop, the program prints the number 50, followed by the elements of the array a separated by spaces. Since the array a contains the numbers from 0 to 49 (inclusive), these numbers will be printed as they are.
