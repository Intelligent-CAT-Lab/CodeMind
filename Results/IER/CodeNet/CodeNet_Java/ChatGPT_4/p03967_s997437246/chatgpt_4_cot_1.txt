<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `solve` method that processes a string of characters consisting of 'g' and 'p'. The `main` method sets up the input stream and output writer, calls the `solve` method, and then flushes the output.

The `solve` method reads a string from the input, converts it to a character array, and initializes a variable `h` to 0. It then iterates over each character in the array. For each 'g' character, it increments `h` by 1, and for each 'p' character, it decrements `h` by 1. After processing all characters, it prints the value of `h` divided by 2.

Given the input `gpg`, the `solve` method will process the characters as follows:
- The first character is 'g', so `h` becomes 1.
- The second character is 'p', so `h` becomes 0.
- The third character is 'g', so `h` becomes 1.

Finally, the method prints the value of `h` divided by 2, which is 1/2. Since `h` is an integer, the division will be integer division, and the result will be truncated to 0.
