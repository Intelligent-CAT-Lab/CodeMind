<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two variables, a and b, with the values 5 and 5 respectively according to the input. It then checks if a is less than or equal to b. Since a is equal to b in this case, the condition is true. Therefore, the code enters the if block and prints the value of a, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
