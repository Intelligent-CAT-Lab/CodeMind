<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input which are 1000 and 3000 respectively.

The variable hannpenn is calculated as the average of a and b, which is (1000 + 3000) / 2. The parentheses ensure that the addition is performed before the division.

The calculation is as follows:
(1000 + 3000) / 2 = 4000 / 2 = 2000

The result of the calculation is stored in the variable hannpenn, which is then printed to the standard output using System.out.println.

Therefore, the output will be the value of hannpenn, which is 2000.

2000
