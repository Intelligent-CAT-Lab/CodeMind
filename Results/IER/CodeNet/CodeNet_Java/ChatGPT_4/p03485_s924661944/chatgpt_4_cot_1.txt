<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input, which are 1 and 3. It then adds these two integers together, resulting in 4. This sum is then divided by 2.0 to get the average, which is 2.0. Since the division is by 2.0 (a double), the result of the division is also a double, ensuring that we get a decimal result if necessary.

The Math.ceil function is then called on this result, which rounds it up to the nearest whole number. Since the result of the division is already a whole number (2.0), the ceiling function does not change the value, and it remains 2.0.

Finally, the result is cast to an int to match the expected output type, and the integer value 2 is printed to the console.
