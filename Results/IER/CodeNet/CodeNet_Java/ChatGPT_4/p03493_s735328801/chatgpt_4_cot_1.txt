<<<Analysis>>>
The input string s is initialized with "101". The variable counter is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates over each character of the string "101". It checks if the current character is '1'.
For the first character '1', the condition is true, so counter is incremented by 1.
For the second character '0', the condition is false, so counter remains the same.
For the third character '1', the condition is true, so counter is incremented by 1 again.
After the loop finishes, the final value of counter is 2, which is the number of '1's in the string "101".
The program then prints the value of counter.
<<<Output>>>
2
