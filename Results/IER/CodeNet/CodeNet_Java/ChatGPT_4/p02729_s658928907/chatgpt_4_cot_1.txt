<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class that implements `Runnable` and contains the `main` method. The `main` method creates an instance of `Main` and calls the `run` method. The `run` method creates an instance of `Solver` and calls its `solve` method.

The `Solver` class contains the `solve` method, which is where the main logic of the program resides. The `solve` method reads two integers `N` and `M` from the input, which are `2` and `1` respectively in this case.

The `solve` method then calculates the sum of two expressions:
1. `N * (N - 1) / 2`: This is the formula for the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers, which represents the number of ways to choose 2 distinct elements from a set of `N` elements (a combination without repetition). For `N = 2`, this expression evaluates to `2 * (2 - 1) / 2 = 1`.
2. `M * (M - 1) / 2`: This is the same formula applied to `M`. For `M = 1`, this expression evaluates to `1 * (1 - 1) / 2 = 0`.

The method then prints the sum of these two expressions, which is `1 + 0 = 1`.

Finally, the `timer` is canceled, and the `flush` method of `Helper` class is called to ensure that the output is written out.

Therefore, the output of the code execution given the input `2 1` will be `1`.
