<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read from the standard input. It then reads a string `s` from the input, which in this case is "ABC". After reading the input, the Scanner object is closed.
The output is determined by a ternary operator that checks if the string `s` is equal to "ABC". If it is, the output will be "ARC"; otherwise, the output will be "ABC".
Since the input string `s` is "ABC", the condition `s.equals("ABC")` evaluates to true, and therefore the ternary operator will return "ARC".
Finally, the program prints the result of the ternary operator to the standard output.
<<<Output>>>
ARC
