<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads a single string `s` from the input, which is "PD?D??P?".
After reading the input, the Scanner is closed.
The main processing part of the code is to replace all occurrences of the character '?' in the string `s` with the character 'D'. This is done using the `replace` method of the String class.
The string "PD?D??P?" has three '?' characters, which will all be replaced by 'D'.
The result of this replacement is stored in the string `result`.
Finally, the code prints out the `result` string, which is the modified version of the input string with all '?' replaced by 'D'.
