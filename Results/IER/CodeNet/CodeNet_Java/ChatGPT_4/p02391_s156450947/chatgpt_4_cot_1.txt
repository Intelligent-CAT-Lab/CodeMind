<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input. The input provided is "1 2", so a is assigned the value 1 and b is assigned the value 2.

The code then enters an if-else statement to compare the values of a and b. The first condition checks if a is greater than b. Since 1 is not greater than 2, this condition is false, and the code moves to the else if condition.

The else if condition checks if a is less than b. Since 1 is indeed less than 2, this condition is true, and the code executes the statement within this block, printing "a < b" to the standard output.

Finally, the Scanner object is closed using the close() method, and the program ends.

<<<Output>>>
a < b
