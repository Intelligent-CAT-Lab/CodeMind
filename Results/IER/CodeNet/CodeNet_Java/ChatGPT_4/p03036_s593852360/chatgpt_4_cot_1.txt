The variables r, d, and x are initialized with 2, 10, and 20 respectively according to the input.
The code enters a for loop that will iterate 10 times.
In each iteration, it calculates a new value for x using the formula x = r * x - d.
For the first iteration, x is calculated as 2 * 20 - 10, which equals 30.
For the second iteration, x is calculated as 2 * 30 - 10, which equals 50.
This process continues for 10 iterations, each time updating the value of x and printing it out.

Let's calculate the value of x for each iteration:
1st iteration: x = 2 * 20 - 10 = 40 - 10 = 30
2nd iteration: x = 2 * 30 - 10 = 60 - 10 = 50
3rd iteration: x = 2 * 50 - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90
4th iteration: x = 2 * 90 - 10 = 180 - 10 = 170
5th iteration: x = 2 * 170 - 10 = 340 - 10 = 330
6th iteration: x = 2 * 330 - 10 = 660 - 10 = 650
7th iteration: x = 2 * 650 - 10 = 1300 - 10 = 1290
8th iteration: x = 2 * 1290 - 10 = 2580 - 10 = 2570
9th iteration: x = 2 * 2570 - 10 = 5140 - 10 = 5130
10th iteration: x = 2 * 5130 - 10 = 10260 - 10 = 10250

After the loop finishes, it will have printed the value of x for each iteration, resulting in 10 lines of output.
