<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "aba". The variable `n` is initialized with the length of `s`, which is 3. The boolean variable `eq` is set to the result of the comparison between the first and the last character of the string `s`. Since 'a' is equal to 'a', `eq` is true.

The program then checks if `eq` is true. Since it is, it goes to the ternary operator that checks if `n % 2` is equal to 0. Since `n` is 3, `n % 2` is 1, which is not equal to 0. Therefore, the condition `n % 2 == 0` is false, and the "else" part of the ternary operator is executed, which is "Second".

The program prints "Second" as the output.
