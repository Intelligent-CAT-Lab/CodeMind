<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a `FastScanner` object to read input from `System.in`. It then reads two long values `X` and `Y` from the input, which are 3 and 20 respectively.

The main part of the code is a while loop that runs as long as `X` is less than or equal to `Y`. Inside the loop, `Y` is divided by 2, and a counter `cou` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs.

The loop will run as follows:
1. `X` is 3 and `Y` is 20, `X` <= `Y` is true, so the loop runs. `Y` becomes 20 / 2 = 10, `cou` becomes 1.
2. `X` is 3 and `Y` is 10, `X` <= `Y` is true, so the loop runs. `Y` becomes 10 / 2 = 5, `cou` becomes 2.
3. `X` is 3 and `Y` is 5, `X` <= `Y` is true, so the loop runs. `Y` becomes 5 / 2 = 2 (integer division), `cou` becomes 3.
4. `X` is 3 and `Y` is 2, `X` <= `Y` is false, so the loop stops.

After the loop, the program prints the value of `cou`, which is 3.
