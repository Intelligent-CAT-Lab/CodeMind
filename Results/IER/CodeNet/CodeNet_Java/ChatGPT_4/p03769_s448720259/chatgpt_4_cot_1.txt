The input is `7`. The variable `n` is initialized with `7`.

The main loop iterates over `d` from `1` to `50`. In each iteration, it calculates `pw` as `(1L<<d)-1`, which is the number with `d` bits all set to `1`. The loop is looking for the smallest `d` such that `pw` is greater than `n`.

For `d = 1`, `pw = (1<<1)-1 = 1`, which is not greater than `n`.
For `d = 2`, `pw = (1<<2)-1 = 3`, which is not greater than `n`.
For `d = 3`, `pw = (1<<3)-1 = 7`, which is equal to `n`.
For `d = 4`, `pw = (1<<4)-1 = 15`, which is greater than `n`.

When `d = 4`, the condition `pw > n` is met, so the loop breaks and the program calls the `doit` method with `n = 7` and `base = d - 1 = 3`.

Inside the `doit` method:
- `B` is calculated as `(1L<<base)/2 = (1<<3)/2 = 4`.
- `now` is calculated as `(1L<<base)-1 = (1<<3)-1 = 7`.
- A list `bone` is created and filled with the numbers `0, 1, 2` twice (since `base = 3`).
- `ln` is initialized to `99`.
- `bi` is initialized to `base-1 = 2`.

The while loop iterates over `bi` from `2` to `0`. Since `now` is already equal to `n`, the condition `now + (1L<<bi) <= n` is never met, and the loop does nothing.

The `ret` array is then filled with the values from the `bone` list, which are `0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2`.

Finally, the program prints the length of the `ret` array, which is `6`, followed by the values in the `ret` array incremented by `1`, separated by spaces.
