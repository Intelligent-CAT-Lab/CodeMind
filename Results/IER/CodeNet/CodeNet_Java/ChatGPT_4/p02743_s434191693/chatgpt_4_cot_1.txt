<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `main` method that sets up a `PrintWriter` for output and an `InputStreamScanner` for input. The `main` method then calls the `solve` method of a new `Main` instance, passing the input and output handlers to it.

The `solve` method uses the `InputStreamScanner` to read three strings from the input, which are expected to be numbers. These strings are then converted to `BigDecimal` objects and passed to the `sqrt` method.

The `sqrt` method calculates the square root of a `BigDecimal` number. It starts with an approximation using `Math.sqrt` and then refines the result using a loop that performs a series of iterations to improve the precision of the square root calculation.

After calculating the square roots of the three input numbers, the `solve` method checks if the sum of the square roots of the first two numbers is less than the square root of the third number. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Given the input `2 3 9`, the square roots of these numbers are approximately:
- sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414
- sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732
- sqrt(9) ≈ 3.000

The sum of the square roots of the first two numbers is approximately 1.414 + 1.732 = 3.146, which is greater than the square root of the third number, 3.000. Therefore, the condition `(a.add(b)).compareTo(c) < 0` is false, and the output will be "No".
