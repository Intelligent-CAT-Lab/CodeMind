The input provided is `2 5 4`. The `solve` method is called in the `main` method, which is where the input is processed.

1. The `gInt()` method is called three times to read the three integers from the input, which are stored in the array `a` as `{2, 5, 4}`.
2. The array `a` is sorted, resulting in `{2, 4, 5}`.
3. A new array `m` is created to store the modulo 2 of each element in `a`, resulting in `{0, 0, 1}`.
4. The variable `r` is initialized to `0`.
5. The program checks if all elements in `m` are equal. Since they are not, it enters the else block.
6. Inside the else block, the program increments `r` by 1, so `r` becomes `1`.
7. The program then checks which two elements in `m` are equal and increments the corresponding elements in `a`. Since `m[0]` and `m[1]` are equal, `a[0]` and `a[1]` are incremented by 1, resulting in `a` becoming `{3, 5, 5}`.
8. The array `a` is sorted again, but since all elements are already in ascending order, it remains `{3, 5, 5}`.
9. Finally, the program calculates the output as `r + (a[2]*2 - a[1] - a[0]) / 2`. Plugging in the values, we get `1 + ((5*2) - 5 - 3) / 2 = 1 + (10 - 5 - 3) / 2 = 1 + 2 / 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.
10. The output `2` is printed to the console.
