The input string is `PETER POTTER`. The program will encode each character of the input string using the `Encode` method of the `MyConv` class and then decode the encoded string back to characters using the `Decode` method.

1. The `Encode` method is called for each character in the input string and the encoded string is built:
   - P -> 111
   - E -> 110
   - T -> 00111
   - E -> 110
   - R -> 1000
   - ' ' (space) -> 101
   - P -> 111
   - O -> 00101
   - T -> 00111
   - T -> 00111
   - E -> 110
   - R -> 1000

   The encoded string becomes:
   `111110001111101111001011110010100111001111101000`

2. The program then pads the encoded string with zeros until its length is a multiple of 5:
   `111110001111101111001011110010100111001111101000` (already a multiple of 5, so no padding is needed)

3. The `Decode` method is called for each 5-character block in the encoded string:
   - 11111 -> ?
   - 00011 -> D
   - 11101 -> -
   - 11100 -> ,
   - 10111 -> X
   - 10010 -> S
   - 10011 -> T
   - 10011 -> T
   - 11101 -> -

4. The decoded characters are concatenated to form the output string:
   `?D,XSTT-`

However, there seems to be a mistake in the encoding or decoding process because the expected output should be the original string `PETER POTTER` if the encoding and decoding are correct. The provided encoding and decoding logic does not match, as the encoded values for the characters do not correspond to the expected decoded values. The encoding and decoding tables are not inverses of each other, which means the output will not be the original input string.
