<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `4 4 6`. The InputReader class reads the input and assigns the values to variables n, a, and b respectively. So, n = 4, a = 4, and b = 6.

The TaskA class's solve method is called with these values. It first checks if a is greater than b, which is not the case here (4 is not greater than 6), so it skips the first if condition.

Next, it checks if n is greater than or equal to 2, which is true (4 is greater than 2), so it enters this block.

Inside this block, it calculates the expression `a + (n - 1) * b - a * (n - 1) - b + 1`. Plugging in the values, we get:

4 + (4 - 1) * 6 - 4 * (4 - 1) - 6 + 1
= 4 + 3 * 6 - 4 * 3 - 6 + 1
= 4 + 18 - 12 - 6 + 1
= 22 - 18
= 4

The result of the calculation is 4, which is then printed out by the PrintWriter.
