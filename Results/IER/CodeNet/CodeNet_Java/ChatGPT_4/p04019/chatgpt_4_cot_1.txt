<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "SENW". The program initializes four boolean variables `checkS`, `checkN`, `checkW`, and `checkE` to `false`. These variables are used to check whether the characters 'S', 'N', 'W', and 'E' are present in the string respectively.

The program then enters a for loop that iterates over each character of the string `s`. For each character, it checks if it is 'S', 'N', 'W', or 'E' and sets the corresponding boolean variable to `true` if the character is found.

- When `i` is 0, `s.charAt(i)` is 'S', so `checkS` becomes `true`.
- When `i` is 1, `s.charAt(i)` is 'E', so `checkE` becomes `true`.
- When `i` is 2, `s.charAt(i)` is 'N', so `checkN` becomes `true`.
- When `i` is 3, `s.charAt(i)` is 'W', so `checkW` becomes `true`.

After the loop, the program checks if `checkS` is equal to `checkN` and `checkW` is equal to `checkE`. Since all the boolean variables are `true`, both conditions are satisfied (`true == true`), and the program prints "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
