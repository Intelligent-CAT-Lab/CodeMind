<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable W using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object.

The input provided is `4`, so the value of W is set to 4.

The code then calculates W multiplied by 32, which is 4 * 32, and prints the result to the standard output.

The calculation is straightforward: 4 * 32 equals 128.

Therefore, the output of the code will be 128.
