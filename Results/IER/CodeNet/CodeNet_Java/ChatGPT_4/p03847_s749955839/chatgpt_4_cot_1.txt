<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `3`, which is assigned to the variable `num`. The code initializes a 2D array `dp` with dimensions 62x3 and fills it with zeros. The array `dp` is used for dynamic programming, where `dp[i][0]` represents the number of ways to make a sum using the first `i` bits when the current bit is 0, `dp[i][1]` when the current bit is 1, and `dp[i][2]` when the current bit is not used.

The code sets `dp[61][2]` to 1, which means there is one way to make a sum using the first 61 bits when the 61st bit is not used. This is the base case for the dynamic programming.

The code then iterates from `i = 60` down to `0`, checking if the `i`th bit of `num` is set (using the `isFlagged` method). Depending on whether the bit is set or not, it updates the `dp` array according to the given recurrence relations.

For the input `3`, the binary representation is `11` (in 2 bits). The loop will check the bits from the 60th bit down to the 0th bit. Since the input `3` only has two bits set, the updates to `dp` will only happen when `i` is 0 or 1.

When `i` is 1, the bit is set, so the code will execute the following:
- `dp[1][0] = dp[2][0] * 3 + dp[2][1] * 2`
- `dp[1][1] = dp[2][1] + dp[2][2]`
- `dp[1][2] = dp[2][2]`

Since `dp[2][0]`, `dp[2][1]`, and `dp[2][2]` are all initialized to 0 except `dp[2][2]` which is 1, the updates will be:
- `dp[1][0] = 0`
- `dp[1][1] = 1`
- `dp[1][2] = 1`

When `i` is 0, the bit is also set, so the code will execute the following:
- `dp[0][0] = dp[1][0] * 3 + dp[1][1] * 2`
- `dp[0][1] = dp[1][1] + dp[1][2]`
- `dp[0][2] = dp[1][2]`

The updates will be:
- `dp[0][0] = 0 * 3 + 1 * 2 = 2`
- `dp[0][1] = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `dp[0][2] = 1`

Finally, the code prints the sum of `dp[0]` modulo `MOD`, which is `(2 + 2 + 1) % MOD = 5 % MOD = 5`, since `MOD` is a large prime number and the sum is less than `MOD`.
