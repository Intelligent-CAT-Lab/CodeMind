<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to read two values from the input, multiply them, and then output the result after dividing by 100. The first value `a` is read as a long integer, and the second value `bs` is read as a string, which is then stripped of any decimal points and parsed as a long integer `b`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis for the given input `198 1.10`:

1. The `solve` method is called with an empty `StringBuilder` object `out`.
2. The `nl()` method of the `In` class is called, which reads the first number `198` as a long integer and assigns it to `a`.
3. The `ns()` method of the `In` class is called, which reads the second value `1.10` as a string.
4. The `replaceAll("\\.", "")` method is called on the string `1.10`, removing the decimal point, resulting in the string `110`.
5. The `Long.parseLong(bs)` method is called on the string `110`, converting it to a long integer and assigning it to `b`.
6. The multiplication `a * b` is performed, which is `198 * 110 = 21780`.
7. The result of the multiplication is divided by `100`, which is `21780 / 100 = 217`.
8. The result `217` is appended to the `StringBuilder` object `out`.
9. The `PrintWriter` object `pw` is created and the content of `out` is printed, which is `217`.

<<<Output>>>
