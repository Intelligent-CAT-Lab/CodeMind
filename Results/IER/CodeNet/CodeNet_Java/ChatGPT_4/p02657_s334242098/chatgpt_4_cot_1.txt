<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with several methods, but only the `main` method is executed when the program runs. The `main` method creates a `Scanner` object to read input from the standard input (usually the keyboard).

The `main` method reads two integers, `x` and `n`, from the input using the `Scanner` object. It then prints the product of `x` and `n` to the standard output.

Given the input `2 5`, the program reads `x` as 2 and `n` as 5. It then calculates the product of `x` and `n`, which is `2 * 5 = 10`, and prints this value.

<<<Output>>>
10
