<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input. Let's denote the first integer as x and the second integer as y.

According to the input, x is 3 and y is 2.

The expression `(x + 1) / 2` is evaluated as follows:
- `x + 1` is `3 + 1`, which equals `4`.
- `4 / 2` equals `2`.

Now we compare the result of the expression `(x + 1) / 2` which is `2` with the second input integer y which is also `2`.

Since `2` is equal to `2`, the condition `(sc.nextInt() + 1) / 2 >= sc.nextInt()` is true.

Therefore, the program prints "YES".

<<<Output>>>
YES
