The variables a, b, and c are initialized with 3, 0, and 10 respectively according to the input. The variable day is initialized with 0 and coins with 0.
The while loop will run until the number of coins is less than c (10 in this case).

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the loop:
- Day 1: coins = 0 + 3 (a) = 3, day = 1
- Day 2: coins = 3 + 3 (a) = 6, day = 2
- Day 3: coins = 6 + 3 (a) = 9, day = 3
- Day 4: coins = 9 + 3 (a) = 12, day = 4

At this point, the coins variable is 12, which is greater than c (10), so the loop stops.

The output will be the value of the day variable when the loop stops, which is 4.
