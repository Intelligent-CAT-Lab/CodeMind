<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). In the `calc` method, it reads an integer `N` from the input, which is 4 in this case.

The output is calculated by the expression `((N+1)/2)/N`. Since `N` is 4, the expression becomes `((4+1)/2)/4`. The inner parentheses are evaluated first, resulting in `5/2`. Since both 5 and 2 are integers, the division is integer division, and the result is 2 (integer division truncates the decimal part).

Now the expression is `2/4`. Since the result is expected to be a double, the integer 2 is implicitly cast to a double before the division, resulting in `2.0/4.0`, which equals `0.5`.

Therefore, the output of the code will be `0.5`.
