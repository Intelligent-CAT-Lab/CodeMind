<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 15 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The code enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to 15. Inside the loop, it checks if the current integer i is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5. If the condition is true, it adds the current integer i to the variable ans.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 14.
The sum of these numbers is 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 13 + 14 = 60.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 60.
<<<Output>>>
60
