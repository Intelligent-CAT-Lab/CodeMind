<<<Analysis>>>
The input `3 0` initializes N with 3 and M with 0. This means that the grid size is 3x3 and there are no obstacles.

Since M is 0, the arrays x and y remain empty, and the obstacle set also remains empty.

The `solve` method checks if N is less than 1000, which it is, so it calls the `bruteFroce` method instead of the more complex logic that follows.

The `bruteFroce` method initializes a 3x3 grid of long integers for `cnt` and `dist`, setting all `dist` values to a very large number (Long.MAX_VALUE / 16) except for `dist[0][0]`, which is set to 0. This represents the starting point (0,0) with a distance of 0.

An ArrayDeque `que` is used to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) on the grid. The starting point (0,0) is added to the queue with a count of 1 path.

The BFS proceeds by dequeuing points from `que` and examining their neighbors. Since there are no obstacles, all neighbors are valid and the search continues until it reaches the destination (2,2).

The BFS updates the `cnt` array with the number of paths to each point and the `dist` array with the minimum distance to reach each point.

Since there are no obstacles, the only path from (0,0) to (2,2) is to move right twice and then down twice, or down twice and then right twice. There are two distinct paths.

After the BFS completes, the `cnt` value at the destination (2,2) is returned, which is the number of paths from the start to the destination.

The `bruteFroce` method will return the value of `cnt[2][2]`, which is the number of paths from (0,0) to (2,2) without encountering any obstacles.

Since there are two distinct paths (right-right-down-down or down-down-right-right), the output will be 2.
