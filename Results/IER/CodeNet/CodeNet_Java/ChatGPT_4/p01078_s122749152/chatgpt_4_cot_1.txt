<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `5 2`, which initializes N with 5 and K with 2. The code is designed to calculate a certain area related to a polygon with N sides.

1. The variable `radDiff` is calculated as `Math.PI * 2 / N`, which is the angle in radians between two adjacent points of the polygon when placed on a unit circle. For N=5, `radDiff` is `2 * Math.PI / 5`.

2. Four points are created: `p1f`, `p1t`, `p2f`, and `p2t`. These points represent the positions of certain vertices of the polygon on the unit circle:
   - `p1f` is at (1, 0), which is the first point on the unit circle.
   - `p1t` is calculated using the cosine and sine of `radDiff * K`, which gives the position of the K-th point from `p1f` in the clockwise direction.
   - `p2f` is calculated using the cosine and sine of `radDiff`, which is the second point from `p1f` in the clockwise direction.
   - `p2t` is calculated using the cosine and sine of `-radDiff * (K - 1)`, which gives the position of the K-th point from `p2f` in the counter-clockwise direction.

3. The `getIntersectPoint` method is called with these four points to find the intersection point of the lines formed by `p1f` to `p1t` and `p2f` to `p2t`.

4. The intersection point `cross` is used to calculate the vectors from `p1f` and `p2f` to `cross`, and these vectors are used to calculate the area of the triangle formed by `p1f`, `p2f`, and `cross`.

5. The area of the triangle formed by `p1f`, `p2f`, and the origin (0,0) is calculated as `all`.

6. The final area to be printed is calculated as `(all - area) * N`, which subtracts the area of the triangle `p1f`, `p2f`, `cross` from the area of the triangle `p1f`, `p2f`, `origin` and then multiplies it by N to account for all such triangles in the polygon.

7. The result is printed with a precision of 9 decimal places.

For the input `5 2`, the calculations will be as follows:
- `radDiff` = `2 * Math.PI / 5`
- `p1f` = (1, 0)
- `p1t` = (cos(2 * Math.PI * 2 / 5), sin(2 * Math.PI * 2 / 5))
- `p2f` = (cos(2 * Math.PI / 5), sin(2 * Math.PI / 5))
- `p2t` = (cos(-2 * Math.PI * (2 - 1) / 5), sin(-2 * Math.PI * (2 - 1) / 5))
- `cross` = intersection point of the lines formed by `p1f` to `p1t` and `p2f` to `p2t`
- `dx1`, `dy1`, `dx2`, `dy2` are the differences in x and y coordinates between `p1f`, `p2f` and `cross`
- `area` = (dx1 * dy2 - dx2 * dy1) / 2
- `all` = (p1f.x * p2f.y - p2f.x * p1f.y) / 2
- Final area to print = `(all - area) * N`

The actual numerical calculations are complex and involve trigonometric functions, so they are not easily done by hand. However, the code will execute these calculations and output the result.
