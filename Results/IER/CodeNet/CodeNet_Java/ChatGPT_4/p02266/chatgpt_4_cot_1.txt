<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is `\\//`. The program initializes three stacks and some variables to keep track of the positions and levels of the slashes, as well as the total area of the "pools" formed by the slashes.

The program iterates over each character in the input string:
1. For the first character `\`, `lv` is decremented to -1 and `pos` is incremented to 1. The position 0 is pushed onto `stackDown`.
2. For the second character `\`, `lv` is decremented to -2 and `pos` is incremented to 2. The position 1 is pushed onto `stackDown`.
3. For the third character `/`, `lv` is incremented to -1. Since `stackDown` is not empty, it pops the top element (1) and calculates the temporary area as `pos - start` which is `2 - 1 = 1`. The total area is incremented by 1. Since `stackArea` is empty, it pushes the temporary area (1) onto `stackArea` and the current level (-1) onto `stackEdge`.
4. For the fourth character `/`, `lv` is incremented to 0. Since `stackDown` is not empty, it pops the top element (0) and calculates the temporary area as `pos - start` which is `3 - 0 = 3`. The total area is incremented by 3 (total area is now 4). Since `stackArea` is not empty and the top of `stackEdge` is less than the current level (0), it pops the last area (1) from `stackArea` and the corresponding level (-1) from `stackEdge`. It then pushes the sum of the last area and the temporary area (1 + 3 = 4) onto `stackArea` and the current level (0) onto `stackEdge`.

After the loop, the program prints the total area, which is 4. It then prints the size of `stackArea`, which is 1, followed by the elements of `stackArea`, which is just the number 4.
