<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3 3`, which means X and Y are both 3.

The `solve` method first checks if the sum of X and Y is divisible by 3. Since 3 + 3 = 6, which is divisible by 3, the method proceeds.

It then calculates the number of turns as (X + Y) / 3, which is 6 / 3 = 2.

Next, it calculates the number of moves to the upper direction as X - turn, which is 3 - 2 = 1, and the number of moves to the right direction as Y - turn, which is also 3 - 2 = 1.

The method then calls `ModInt.combination(turn, upper)`, which calculates the combination of 2 items taken 1 at a time. This is equivalent to the binomial coefficient C(2, 1), which is 2.

Since the ModInt class handles all operations under a modulo of 1_000_000_007, and the result 2 is less than the modulo, the result remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output of the code will be 2.
