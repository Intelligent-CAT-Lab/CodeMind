<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the input, which are 4 and 10 respectively. It then calculates the value of ans as (b-1)/(a-1), which is (10-1)/(4-1) = 9/3 = 3. 

Next, the code checks if the remainder of (b-1)%(a-1) is equal to 0. In this case, (10-1)%(4-1) = 9%3 = 0, which means the if condition is true.

Since the if condition is true, the code prints the value of ans, which is 3.

<<<Output>>>
3
