<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `solve` method that takes a `FastScanner` object, a `PrintWriter` object, and a `Methods` object as parameters. The `solve` method checks if the next string input from the `FastScanner` is equal to "ani". If it is, it prints "square1001" to the output; otherwise, it prints "e869120".

The `main` method creates a `FastScanner` object to read from `System.in` and a `PrintWriter` object to write to `System.out`. It then calls the `solve` method with these objects and a new `Methods` object. After `solve` is called, it closes both the `FastScanner` and the `PrintWriter`.

The `FastScanner` class is a custom scanner class that reads input more efficiently than the standard `Scanner` class. It reads input as bytes and converts them to strings or other types as needed.

Given the input "ani", the `solve` method will receive this string, compare it with "ani", find that they are equal, and therefore the output will be "square1001".
