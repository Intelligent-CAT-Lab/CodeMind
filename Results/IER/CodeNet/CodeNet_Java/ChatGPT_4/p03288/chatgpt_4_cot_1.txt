<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads a long integer value into the variable r. The input provided is `1199`.

The code then checks the value of r against two conditions using if-else statements:
1. If r is less than 1200, it prints "ABC".
2. Else if r is less than 2800, it prints "ARC".
3. Else, it prints "AGC".

Since the input value `1199` is less than 1200, the first condition is true. Therefore, the code will print "ABC" and skip the other conditions.

<<<Output>>>
ABC
