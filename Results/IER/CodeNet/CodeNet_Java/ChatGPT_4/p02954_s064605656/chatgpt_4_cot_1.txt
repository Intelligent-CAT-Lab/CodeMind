The input string `s` is initialized with "RRLRL". The `result` StringBuilder is initialized to store the final result.

The while loop checks if the string `s` contains the substring "LR". If it does, it finds the index of "LR" and stores it in `indexLR`. Since "LR" is found at index 2, `indexLR` is set to 2.

The code then checks if `indexLR` is 1. If it is, it sets `lastIndexOfFirstRLBlock` to 1; otherwise, it sets it to `indexLR`. In this case, `indexLR` is not 1, so `lastIndexOfFirstRLBlock` is set to 2.

The substring `firstRLBlock` is then extracted from `s`, which is from index 0 to `lastIndexOfFirstRLBlock` + 1 (inclusive). This results in "RRL". The remaining part of `s` is updated to be the substring from `lastIndexOfFirstRLBlock` + 1 to the end, which is "RL".

The `makeSubResult` method is called with "RRL" and the result is appended to `result`. Inside `makeSubResult`, the last index of "R" in "RRL" is found to be 1, so `countR` is 2. The `countL` is the length of "RRL" minus `countR`, which is 1.

The string "RRL" is then replaced with "AB" where "RL" is found, resulting in "AB". The remaining "R" is replaced with "0 ", so the string becomes "0 0 B". The "L" is not present anymore.

The `halfCountR` is calculated as `countR` / 2, which is 1. The `halfCountL` is `countL` / 2, which is 0. The value of `A` is calculated as `halfCountR` + `countR` % 2 + `halfCountL`, which is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1. The value of `B` is `halfCountR` + `halfCountL` + `countL` % 2, which is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

The "A" in the string is replaced with "1 ", and the "B" is replaced with "2 ", resulting in "0 0 2 ". This is appended to `result`.

The while loop continues with the updated `s`, which is now "RL". Since "LR" is not found, the loop ends.

The `makeSubResult` method is called with "RL" and the result is appended to `result`. Inside `makeSubResult`, the last index of "R" in "RL" is 0, so `countR` is 1. The `countL` is the length of "RL" minus `countR`, which is 1.

The string "RL" is replaced with "AB", resulting in "AB". There are no more "R" or "L" to replace.

The `halfCountR` is `countR` / 2, which is 0. The `halfCountL` is `countL` / 2, which is 0. The value of `A` is `halfCountR` + `countR` % 2 + `halfCountL`, which is 0 + 1 + 0 = 1. The value of `B` is `halfCountR` + `halfCountL` + `countL` % 2, which is 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.

The "A" in the string is replaced with "1 ", and the "B" is replaced with "1 ", resulting in "1 1 ".

The final `result` is "0 0 2 1 1 ", which is printed to the console.
