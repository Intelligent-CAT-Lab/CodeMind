<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads a string `s` from the input, which is "SAT" in this case. The variable `a` is initialized to 1.

The code then checks the value of `s` against different strings representing the days of the week. If `s` matches one of the days, it assigns a new value to `a` corresponding to the number of days until Sunday. Since "SAT" does not match any of the conditions in the if-else statements, the value of `a` remains 1.

Finally, the code prints the value of `a`, which is 1.
