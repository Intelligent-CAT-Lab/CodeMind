<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is "aabxyyzz". The length of the string N is 8.

The code initializes an array dp with size 1 << 26 (which is 2^26, representing all possible combinations of 26 lowercase letters). All elements of dp are initially set to INF (which is defined as 1e7, a large number).

The variable mask is initialized to 0, and dp[0] is set to 0.

The code then iterates over each character in the string S. For each character, it updates the mask by XORing it with 1 left-shifted by the character's position in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).

After updating the mask for each character, it sets dp[mask] to the minimum of its current value and i + 1 (where i is the index of the current character).

Then, for each letter in the alphabet (0 to 25), it updates dp[mask] to the minimum of its current value and 1 + dp[mask XOR 1 << j] (where j is the current letter's position in the alphabet).

After processing the entire string, the code prints the maximum of 1 and dp[mask].

Let's go through the string "aabxyyzz" and see how the mask and dp array change:

- For 'a': mask = 1, dp[1] = min(INF, 0 + 1) = 1
- For 'a': mask = 0 (since 'a' appears twice, XORing twice cancels out), dp[0] = 0 (unchanged)
- For 'b': mask = 2, dp[2] = min(INF, 2 + 1) = 3
- For 'x': mask = 2 ^ (1 << 23), dp[mask] = min(INF, 3 + 1) = 4
- For 'y': mask = 2 ^ (1 << 23) ^ (1 << 24), dp[mask] = min(INF, 4 + 1) = 5
- For 'y': mask = 2 (since 'y' appears twice, XORing twice cancels out), dp[2] = 3 (unchanged)
- For 'z': mask = 2 ^ (1 << 25), dp[mask] = min(INF, 6 + 1) = 7
- For 'z': mask = 2 (since 'z' appears twice, XORing twice cancels out), dp[2] = 3 (unchanged)

Finally, the output is the maximum of 1 and dp[mask], which is dp[2] = 3.
