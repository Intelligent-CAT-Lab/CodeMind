The input is `6`, which is assigned to the variable `k`. The `init(k)` method initializes three arrays `parent`, `rank`, and `num` with the size of `k`. Each element in `parent` is initialized to its index, `rank` is initialized to 0, and `num` is initialized to 1.

The first for loop iterates from 1 to `k-1` (1 to 5 in this case) and calls the `unite` method with `i` and `(i*10)%k`. This loop effectively creates a union-find structure that groups numbers that can be transformed into each other by multiplying by 10 and taking the remainder when divided by `k`.

The second for loop initializes an array of `HashSet` called `edges` with size `k`. Each element in `edges` is a new `HashSet`.

The third for loop iterates from 0 to `k-1` and checks if `i` and `(i+1)%k` are not in the same set (i.e., they do not have the same root). If they are not in the same set, it adds the root of `(i+1)%k` to the `HashSet` of the root of `i`.

An `ArrayDeque` called `dq` is created and initialized with the root of 1. An array `d` is created with size `k` and all elements initialized to -1, except for the root of 1, which is set to 0.

A while loop then processes the `dq` deque. It dequeues an element `now`, iterates over all the connected nodes `next` in `edges[now]`, and if `d[next]` is -1, it sets `d[next]` to `d[now]+1` and enqueues `next` into `dq`.

Finally, the program prints `d[root(0)]+1`, which is the distance from the root of 1 to the root of 0 plus 1.

Let's analyze the specific case with `k=6`:

- The `unite` method will be called with the following pairs: (1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 4), (5, 2). This will create sets that group numbers that can be transformed into each other by multiplying by 10 and taking the remainder when divided by 6.
- The `edges` array will contain connections between numbers that are not in the same set after adding 1 and taking the remainder when divided by 6.
- The `dq` deque will start with the root of 1, which is 1.
- The `d` array will have `d[1]=0` and all other elements as -1.
- The while loop will process the deque and update the `d` array with the distances from the root of 1 to other roots.

After processing, we will have the distance from the root of 1 to the root of 0, which is the answer we need to print.

Let's simulate the process:

- `unite` calls will result in the following sets: {0, 3}, {1}, {2, 4, 5}
- `edges` will have connections: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 0
- `dq` will process 1, then 2, then 0.
- `d` will be updated to: d[1]=0, d[2]=1, d[0]=2

The output will be `d[root(0)]+1`, which is `d[0]+1`, so the output is `2+1=3`.
