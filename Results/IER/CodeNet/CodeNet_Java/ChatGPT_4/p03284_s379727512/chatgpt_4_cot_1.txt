<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, N and K, from the input. For the given input, N is assigned the value 7 and K is assigned the value 3.

The code then checks if N is divisible by K using the modulus operator (%). If N % K equals 0, it means N is divisible by K, and the variable ans is set to 0. Otherwise, ans is set to 1.

For the given input, 7 % 3 is not equal to 0 (since 7 is not divisible by 3), so the else block is executed and ans is set to 1.

Finally, the value of ans is printed to the standard output. Since ans is 1, that is the expected output.
