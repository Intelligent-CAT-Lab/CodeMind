<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b. In this case, a is assigned the value 4 and b is assigned the value 11.
It then checks if the sum of a and b equals 15. Since 4 + 11 equals 15, the condition is true.
Because the first condition is met, the variable ans is set to "+".
The code then prints the value of ans, which is "+".
