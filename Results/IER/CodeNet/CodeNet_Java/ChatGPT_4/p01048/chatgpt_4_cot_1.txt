<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `ans` with the values `{0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 16, 12, 64, 24, 36, 48, 1024, 60}`. Then it reads an integer `i` from the input, which is `1` in this case. It then prints the value at index `i` of the `ans` array. Since arrays in Java are zero-indexed, `ans[1]` will be the second element of the array, which is `1`.
