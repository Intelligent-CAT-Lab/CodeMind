<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to solve a classic problem where there are a certain number of animals (cranes and turtles), and we know the total number of heads (x) and the total number of legs (y). Cranes have 2 legs each, and turtles have 4 legs each. The goal is to determine if it's possible to have a non-negative integer number of cranes and turtles that match the given number of heads and legs.

The input provided is `3 8`, which means there are 3 heads and 8 legs in total.

The variable `x` is initialized with the value 3, and the variable `y` is initialized with the value 8.

The variable `crane` is calculated using the formula `-(y/2) + 2*x`, which results in `-(8/2) + 2*3`, simplifying to `-4 + 6`, which equals `2`.

The variable `turtle` is calculated by subtracting `crane` from `x`, which results in `3 - 2`, which equals `1`.

The code then checks if either `turtle` or `crane` is negative, or if either is not an integer (checked by `turtle % 1 != 0` or `crane % 1 != 0`). Since neither `turtle` nor `crane` is negative, and both are integers (2.0 and 1.0, which are considered integers in this context), the condition is false.

Therefore, the code will print "Yes", indicating that it is possible to have 2 cranes and 1 turtle with a total of 3 heads and 8 legs.
