<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a constructor that creates an instance of an inner class `AOJ0257` and calls its `doIt` method. The `AOJ0257` class has a method `solve` that takes a `String` input and returns "Open" if the input is "1 1 0" or "0 0 1", otherwise it returns "Close".

The `doIt` method of `AOJ0257` class uses a `Scanner` object `in` from the outer class `Main` to read input lines. For each input line, it calls the `solve` method and prints the result.

Given the input `0 0 1`, the `solve` method will be called with this input. Since the input matches one of the conditions for returning "Open" (specifically "0 0 1"), the `solve` method will return "Open".

The `doIt` method will then print the result of the `solve` method, which is "Open".

Open
