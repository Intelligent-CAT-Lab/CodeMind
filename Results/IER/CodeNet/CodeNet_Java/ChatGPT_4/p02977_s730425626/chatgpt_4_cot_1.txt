<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `3`. The code is designed to perform some operations based on the input integer `n`.

1. The `InputReader` class reads the input `3` and assigns it to `n`.
2. The `prev` variable is calculated as `(n + 1) / 4 * 4 - 1`, which for `n = 3` results in `3`.
3. The condition `if (prev > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) != 0)` is checked. For `n = 3`, `prev` is `3` and `n & (n - 1)` is `2 & 3` which is `2`, so the condition is true.
4. The program prints "Yes" because the condition is true.
5. An array `seq` of size `2 * prev` (which is `6`) is created and filled with the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.
6. The program then prints pairs of consecutive numbers from the `seq` array, which are `1 2`, `2 3`, `3 4`, `4 5`, `5 6`.
7. A `pxor` array is created to store the prefix XOR of the sequence modulo `n`. Since `n` is `3`, the modulo operation will cycle through `1, 2, 0`.
8. The program checks if `pxor[seq.length / 2]` and `pxor[seq.length]` are both `0`. If not, it would throw a `RuntimeException`, but in this case, they are both `0`.
9. Since `n` is `3`, it is less than `prev + 2` (which is `5`), so the program enters the `else if (n == prev + 1)` block.
10. Inside this block, the program looks for two indices `src` and `dest` such that the XOR of `pxor[src]` and `pxor[dest + 1]` equals `n`. It finds such indices and prints `n` followed by `seq[src]`, and then `seq[dest]` followed by `n + n` (which is `6`).
11. The program finds that `pxor[2] ^ pxor[4]` is `3`, which is equal to `n`. Therefore, it prints `3 2` and `3 6`.

The program does not throw any `RuntimeException`, so the output will be the sequence of printed pairs as described above.
