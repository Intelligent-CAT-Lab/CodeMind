<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads three integers A, B, and C from the input, which are 5, 7, and 5 respectively according to the given input.

The code then enters a series of conditional checks:
- First, it checks if A is equal to B. Since A is 5 and B is 7, this condition is false.
- Next, it checks if B is equal to C. Since B is 7 and C is 5, this condition is also false.
- Since neither of the first two conditions is true, the code proceeds to the else block and prints the value of B.

Therefore, the output will be the value of B, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
