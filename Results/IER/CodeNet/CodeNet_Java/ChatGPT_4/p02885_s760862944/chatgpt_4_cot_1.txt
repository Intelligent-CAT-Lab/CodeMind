<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two integers A and B with the values 12 and 4 respectively according to the input. Then it calculates the result by subtracting twice the value of B from A, which is 12 - (2 * 4) = 12 - 8 = 4. The if statement checks if the result is less than or equal to 0, which it is not in this case, so the result remains 4. Finally, the code prints the value of the result.
<<<Output>>>
4
