<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "uncopyrightable" is read and stored in the variable s. A character array c of the same length as the input string is created and then filled with the characters of the string by using the toCharArray() method.

The Arrays.sort(c) method is called, which sorts the characters of the array c in alphabetical order. The sorted array c will look like this: "aabceghilnoprtuy".

The for loop then iterates over the sorted array c, from index 0 to the second-to-last index (length - 2), comparing each character with the next one. If two adjacent characters are the same, it prints "no" and returns, ending the program. If the loop completes without finding any identical adjacent characters, it prints "yes".

In the sorted array "aabceghilnoprtuy", there are no two adjacent characters that are the same. Therefore, the loop completes without printing "no", and after the loop, "yes" is printed.

<<<Output>>>
yes
