<<<Analysis>>>
The variables num, blue, and red are initialized with 8, 3, and 4 respectively according to the input.

The variable remainder is calculated as num % (blue + red), which is 8 % (3 + 4) = 8 % 7 = 1. This represents the number of items that cannot form a complete set of blue and red items.

The variable countBlue is calculated as num / (blue + red) * blue, which is 8 / (3 + 4) * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3. This represents the number of blue items in the complete sets.

Since remainder (1) is less than blue (3), the else block is executed, and remainder is added to countBlue, resulting in countBlue = 3 + 1 = 4.

Finally, the value of countBlue is printed, which is 4.
