<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method and a nested `Reader` class that implements `AutoCloseable`. The `Reader` class is designed to read different types of data from an `InputStream`, in this case, `System.in`.

The `main` method creates an instance of `Reader` with `System.in` as the input stream. It then calls the `i()` method of the `Reader` instance to read an integer value from the input. The input provided is `4`.

The `i()` method internally calls the `s()` method to read a string from the buffer. If the buffer is empty or fully read (`bufidx == -1` or `bufidx == buf.length`), it reads a new line from the `BufferedReader` and splits it into an array of strings (`buf`), resetting `bufidx` to `0`. Since this is the first read operation, it will read the input line, which is `4`, and split it into an array of one string.

The `s()` method returns the next string in the buffer, which is `4`, and increments `bufidx`. The `i()` method then parses this string to an integer, which is `4`.

Back in the `main` method, the integer `N` is now `4`. The expression `(N - 1) / 2` is evaluated as `(4 - 1) / 2`, which is `3 / 2`. Since both `3` and `2` are integers, integer division is performed, resulting in `1`.

Finally, the result of the expression, which is `1`, is printed to the console.
