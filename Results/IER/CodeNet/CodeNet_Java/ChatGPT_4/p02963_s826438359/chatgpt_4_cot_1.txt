The input is `3`. The `solve()` method is called, which first calls `nl()` to read the input as a long integer. The value of `s` is set to `3`.

The `solve()` method then calls `sqrtL(s)` to find the square root of `s`. The `sqrtL()` method performs a binary search to find the smallest integer value `ok` such that `ok * ok` is greater than or equal to `N` (in this case, `3`). The initial value of `ok` is set to `Math.sqrt(N) + 1`, which is `2` in this case because `Math.sqrt(3)` is approximately `1.732` and adding `1` gives `2.732`, which is truncated to `2` when cast to a long. The binary search will not change the value of `ok` because `2 * 2` is already greater than `3`. Therefore, `sqrtL(3)` returns `2`.

Back in the `solve()` method, it checks if `sq * sq` is equal to `s`. Since `2 * 2` is `4` and not equal to `3`, it goes to the else block.

In the else block, it calculates `t` as `sq * sq - s`, which is `4 - 3`, resulting in `1`.

Finally, it prints `sq + " " + 1 + " " + t + " " + sq + " " + 0 + " " + 0`, which is `2 + " " + 1 + " " + 1 + " " + 2 + " " + 0 + " " + 0`.

Therefore, the output will be `2 1 1 2 0 0`.
