The input is `101`. The variable N is initialized with 101. The length of N (l) is calculated to be 3 since 101 has three digits.

The variable m is initialized to 0. A for loop runs for l (3) iterations. In each iteration, m is updated as follows:
- First iteration: m = (10 * 0 + 7) % 101 = 7 % 101 = 7
- Second iteration: m = (10 * 7 + 7) % 101 = 77 % 101 = 77
- Third iteration: m = (10 * 77 + 7) % 101 = 777 % 101 = 75

The variable i is initialized to l, which is 3.

A boolean array vis of size N (101) is created to keep track of visited remainders.

The while loop starts and will run until it finds a remainder that has been seen before (indicating a cycle) or until the remainder becomes 0 (indicating that a number composed of only 7's is divisible by N).

- First pass through the while loop: m is 75, which is not 0 and has not been visited before, so vis[75] is set to true, and the loop continues. m is updated to (10 * 75 + 7) % 101 = 757 % 101 = 49, and i is incremented to 4.
- Second pass: m is 49, which is not 0 and has not been visited before, so vis[49] is set to true, and the loop continues. m is updated to (10 * 49 + 7) % 101 = 497 % 101 = 94, and i is incremented to 5.
- Third pass: m is 94, which is not 0 and has not been visited before, so vis[94] is set to true, and the loop continues. m is updated to (10 * 94 + 7) % 101 = 947 % 101 = 38, and i is incremented to 6.
- Fourth pass: m is 38, which is not 0 and has not been visited before, so vis[38] is set to true, and the loop continues. m is updated to (10 * 38 + 7) % 101 = 387 % 101 = 84, and i is incremented to 7.
- Fifth pass: m is 84, which is not 0 and has not been visited before, so vis[84] is set to true, and the loop continues. m is updated to (10 * 84 + 7) % 101 = 847 % 101 = 37, and i is incremented to 8.
- Sixth pass: m is 37, which is not 0 and has not been visited before, so vis[37] is set to true, and the loop continues. m is updated to (10 * 37 + 7) % 101 = 377 % 101 = 73, and i is incremented to 9.
- Seventh pass: m is 73, which is not 0 and has not been visited before, so vis[73] is set to true, and the loop continues. m is updated to (10 * 73 + 7) % 101 = 737 % 101 = 31, and i is incremented to 10.
- Eighth pass: m is 31, which is not 0 and has not been visited before, so vis[31] is set to true, and the loop continues. m is updated to (10 * 31 + 7) % 101 = 317 % 101 = 14, and i is incremented to 11.
- Ninth pass: m is 14, which is not 0 and has not been visited before, so vis[14] is set to true, and the loop continues. m is updated to (10 * 14 + 7) % 101 = 147 % 101 = 45, and i is incremented to 12.
- Tenth pass: m is 45, which is not 0 and has not been visited before, so vis[45] is set to true, and the loop continues. m is updated to (10 * 45 + 7) % 101 = 457 % 101 = 51, and i is incremented to 13.
- Eleventh pass: m is 51, which is not 0 and has not been visited before, so vis[51] is set to true, and the loop continues. m is updated to (10 * 51 + 7) % 101 = 517 % 101 = 11
