<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "oxoxoxoxoxoxox", which has a length of 14 characters. This length is assigned to the variable `day`. The variable `nday` is calculated as 15 - `day`, which is 15 - 14 = 1.

The program then enters a for loop that iterates over each character in the input string. It counts the number of 'o' characters in the string and stores this count in the variable `cnt`. In the given string, there are 7 'o' characters.

After the loop, the program checks two conditions:
1. If `day` is less than or equal to 7, which is not the case here since `day` is 14.
2. If `day` is greater than or equal to 8 and the sum of `cnt` and `nday` is greater than or equal to 8. In this case, `day` is indeed greater than or equal to 8, and the sum of `cnt` (which is 7) and `nday` (which is 1) is 8, which meets the condition.

Since the second condition is met, the program will print "YES".

<<<Output>>>
YES
