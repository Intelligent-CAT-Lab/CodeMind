The input is `11`, which is assigned to the variable `n`. The code is looking for the smallest `k` such that the sum `1+2+...+k` is a multiple of `n`. This is equivalent to finding the smallest `k` such that `k(k+1)/2 % n == 0`.

First, the code checks if `n` is `1`. If it is, it prints `1` and returns. Since `n` is `11`, this condition is not met, and the code proceeds.

The code then calls the `divisorList` method with `2*n` (which is `22` in this case) to get a list of all divisors of `22`. The divisors of `22` are `1, 2, 11, 22`. The list is sorted in natural order.

Next, the code initializes `ans` with `INF` (a very large number) and iterates over each divisor `a` in the list. For each `a`, it calculates `b` as `2*n/a`. Then it calls the `extgcd` method to solve the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)` and get the values of `x` and `y`.

The `extgcd` method uses the Extended Euclidean algorithm to find `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. It returns an array containing `gcd(a, b)`, `x`, and `y`.

For each divisor `a`, the code checks if `x` or `y` is `0`, and if so, it continues to the next iteration. If `g` (the greatest common divisor) is `1`, and `y` is negative, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `-b*y`.

After iterating through all divisors, the code prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum `k` such that `k(k+1)/2 % n == 0`.

Let's calculate the values for each divisor of `22`:
- For `a = 1`, `b = 22`, `extgcd(1, 22)` returns `{1, 1, 0}`, but since `y` is `0`, it continues to the next iteration.
- For `a = 2`, `b = 11`, `extgcd(2, 11)` returns `{1, -5, 1}`, and since `y` is negative, `ans` is updated to `min(INF, -11*1) = 11`.
- For `a = 11`, `b = 2`, `extgcd(11, 2)` returns `{1, 1, -5}`, and since `y` is negative, `ans` is updated to `min(11, -2*-5) = 10`.
- For `a = 22`, `b = 1`, `extgcd(22, 1)` returns `{1, 0, 1}`, but since `x` is `0`, it continues to the next iteration.

The smallest value of `ans` found is `10`, so the code will print `10`.
