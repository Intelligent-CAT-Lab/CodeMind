<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and K are initialized with 3, 8, and 2 respectively according to the input. A TreeSet named nums is created to store integers in sorted order without duplicates.

The first for loop runs for K iterations (2 iterations in this case). It checks if A + i is greater than B, and if so, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it adds A + i to the nums set. For the given input, the loop will add 3 and 4 to the nums set.

The second for loop also runs for K iterations. It checks if B - i is less than A, and if so, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it adds B - i to the nums set. For the given input, the loop will add 8 and 7 to the nums set.

Since nums is a TreeSet, it will automatically sort the numbers and remove any duplicates. The final set will contain the numbers 3, 4, 7, and 8.

Finally, the forEach method is used to print each number in the nums set on a new line. The output will be the numbers in the set printed in ascending order.
