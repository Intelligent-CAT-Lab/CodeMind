<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "AtCoder Beginner Contest" is read and split into an array of strings `lines` based on spaces. The array `lines` will contain ["AtCoder", "Beginner", "Contest"].
The second word "Beginner" is accessed at index 1 of the array `lines`. The first character 'B' of the string "Beginner" is accessed using `charAt(0)` and stored in the variable `upper`.
The program then prints "A" concatenated with the character `upper` ('B') and "C", resulting in the string "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
