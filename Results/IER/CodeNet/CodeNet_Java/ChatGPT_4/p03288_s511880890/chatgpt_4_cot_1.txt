<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main class with a main method that initializes an InputReader to read from the System input stream and a PrintWriter to write to the System output stream. It then creates an instance of TaskA and calls its solve method, passing in the test number (1 in this case), the InputReader, and the PrintWriter. After the solve method is called, it closes the PrintWriter.

The TaskA class has a solve method that reads an integer n using the InputReader. It then checks the value of n against two conditions:
- If n is less than 1200, it prints "ABC".
- If n is greater than or equal to 1200 but less than 2800, it prints "ARC".
- If n is greater than or equal to 2800, it prints "AGC".

Given the input `1199`, the first condition is met because 1199 is less than 1200. Therefore, the output will be "ABC".
