<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class that implements `Runnable` and contains a `main` method that starts a new thread with a stack size of 16 MB. The `run` method of the `Main` class is where the main logic of the program is executed.

The `run` method creates an instance of `FastScanner`, which is a custom scanner class designed to read input from `System.in` more efficiently than the standard `Scanner` class.

The `FastScanner` class has methods to read different types of input, such as `nextInt`, `nextLong`, `nextDouble`, and so on. It uses a buffer to read chunks of input from the stream and processes it byte by byte.

In the `run` method, two integers `n` and `k` are read using `sc.nextInt()`. The input provided is `5 10`, so `n` is assigned the value `5` and `k` is assigned the value `10`.

The program then checks if `n` is less than or equal to `k`. Since `5` is less than `10`, the condition is true, and the program prints `1`.

If `n` had been greater than `k`, the program would have printed `0`.
