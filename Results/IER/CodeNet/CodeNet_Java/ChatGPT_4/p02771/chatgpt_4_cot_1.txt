<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized with 5, 7, and 5 respectively according to the input.
The if condition checks two scenarios:
1. If A equals B and B equals C, which would mean all three numbers are the same.
2. If A is not equal to B, A is not equal to C, and B is not equal to C, which would mean all three numbers are distinct.

If either of these scenarios is true, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

In this case, A is equal to C, but B is different from both A and C. This means neither of the two scenarios in the if condition is true. Therefore, the else block is executed, and "Yes" is printed.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
