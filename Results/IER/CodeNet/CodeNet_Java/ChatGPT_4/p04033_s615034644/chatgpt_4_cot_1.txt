<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `1 3`. The variables a and b are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.

The first if condition checks if the product of a and b is less than or equal to 0. Since 1 * 3 is 3, which is greater than 0, this condition is not met and the code does not print "Zero".

The second if condition checks if a is greater than 0. Since a is 1, which is greater than 0, this condition is met and the code prints "Positive". The method returns immediately after printing, so the subsequent if condition is not evaluated.

Therefore, the output of the code will be "Positive".
<<<Output>>>
Positive
