<<<Analysis>>>
The Scanner object `sc` is created to read input from the standard input stream. The program then reads a string `str` from the input, which is "a" in this case.
The character at index 0 of the string `str` is retrieved and stored in the variable `a`. Since `str` is "a", `a` will also be 'a'.
The integer value of the character `a` is then obtained by casting it to an int and stored in the variable `b`. The ASCII value of 'a' is 97.
The character that comes after 'a' in the ASCII table is calculated by adding 1 to the ASCII value of 'a' and casting it back to a char. This is stored in the variable `c`. So, `c` will be the character 'b', which has an ASCII value of 98.
Finally, the program prints the value of `c`, which is 'b'.
<<<Output>>>
b
