<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `10`. The `solver` method is called with an `InputReader` that reads this input and a `PrintWriter` to output the result.

The variable `n` is initialized with the value `10`. The variable `sqrt` is calculated as the square root of `n`, which is `Math.sqrt(10)` and cast to a long, resulting in `3` because casting to long truncates the decimal part.

The program enters a for loop with `i` starting from `sqrt` (3) and decreasing to 1. It checks if `n` is divisible by `i` without a remainder. If it is, it sets `x` to `i` and `y` to `n / i`, then breaks out of the loop.

For `n = 10`, when `i = 2`, `n % i` is `0`, so `x` is set to `2` and `y` is set to `10 / 2`, which is `5`. The loop breaks.

The program then calculates `ans` as `(x - 1) + (y - 1)`, which is `(2 - 1) + (5 - 1)`, resulting in `1 + 4`, which is `5`.

The output is then printed as `5`.
