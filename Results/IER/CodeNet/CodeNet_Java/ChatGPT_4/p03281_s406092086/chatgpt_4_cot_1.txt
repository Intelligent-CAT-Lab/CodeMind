The variable n is initialized with 105 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The code enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to 105 to check each integer i in this range. It only processes odd numbers because of the condition if(i % 2 == 1).

For each odd number i, it initializes a temporary variable tmp with the value of i and an array div of size 106 (n + 1) with all elements initialized to 0.

The inner while loop is used to factorize the number tmp into its prime factors. For each prime factor j found, it increments div[j] and divides tmp by j. This loop continues until tmp becomes 1.

After factorization, the code calculates the total number of divisors of i by multiplying (div[j] + 1) for all j from 2 to 105. This is because if a number has a prime factorization of p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ... * pk^ek, the total number of divisors is (e1 + 1) * (e2 + 1) * ... * (ek + 1).

If the total number of divisors count is equal to 8, it increments ans by 1.

After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output.

Let's manually calculate the number of odd numbers less than or equal to 105 that have exactly 8 divisors:

- 3^1 * 5^1 * 7^1 = 105 (1 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 divisors)
- 3^3 * 5^1 = 135 (not considered, greater than 105)
- 3^1 * 7^2 = 147 (not considered, greater than 105)
- 5^2 * 7^1 = 175 (not considered, greater than 105)
- 3^2 * 5^1 = 45 (3 * 2 = 6 divisors, not 8)
- 3^1 * 5^2 = 75 (2 * 3 = 6 divisors, not 8)
- 3^1 * 7^1 = 21 (2 * 2 = 4 divisors, not 8)
- 5^1 * 7^1 = 35 (2 * 2 = 4 divisors, not 8)
- 3^1 * 11^1 = 33 (2 * 2 = 4 divisors, not 8)
- 3^1 * 13^1 = 39 (2 * 2 = 4 divisors, not 8)

- 3^1 * 29^1 = 87 (2 * 2 = 4 divisors, not 8)
- 3^1 * 31^1 = 93 (2 * 2 = 4 divisors, not 8)
- 3^1 * 37^1 = 111 (not considered, greater than 105)

- 3^1 * 43^1 = 129 (not considered, greater than 105)
- 3^1 * 47^1 = 141 (not considered, greater than 105)
- 3^1 * 53^1 = 159 (not considered, greater than 105)
- 3^1 * 59^1 = 177 (not considered, greater than 105)
- 3^1 * 61^1 = 183 (not considered, greater than 105)

- 3^1 * 83^1 = 249 (not considered, greater than 105)
- 3^1 * 89^1 = 267 (not considered, greater than
