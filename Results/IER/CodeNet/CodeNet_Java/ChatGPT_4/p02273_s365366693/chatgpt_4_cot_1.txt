<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `1`, which is assigned to the variable `n`. The program initializes two points `p` and `r` at coordinates (0,0) and (100,0) respectively. It then prints the coordinates of point `p` with 8 decimal places.

The `curve` function is called with `n`, `p`, and `r` as arguments. Since `n` is greater than 0, the function calculates three new points `s`, `t`, and `u` which are used to divide the line segment from `a` to `b` into four equal parts and create an equilateral triangle on the middle segment.

The coordinates of `s` are calculated as two-thirds from `a` and one-third from `b`. The coordinates of `t` are calculated as one-third from `a` and two-thirds from `b`. The coordinates of `u` are calculated using the rotation matrix to rotate point `t` 60 degrees around point `s`.

The `curve` function is then called recursively with decremented `n` and the new points, which results in printing the coordinates of `s`, `u`, and `t` in that order. Since `n` is 1, the recursion will not go deeper.

Finally, the coordinates of point `r` are printed.

The output will be the coordinates of points `p`, `s`, `u`, `t`, and `r` in that order, each printed on a new line with 8 decimal places.
