The input is `4 1 3`, which initializes n with 4, a with 1, and b with 3.

The `binarypow` function is a recursive function that calculates a to the power of b modulo r (where r is 1000000007). It uses the property that a^(2k) = (a^k)^2 and a^(2k+1) = a * a^(2k) to reduce the number of multiplications needed.

The `combination` function calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, k) modulo r using the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!). It calculates n! / k! modulo r in the variable `tmpx` and 1 / (n-k)! modulo r in the variable `tmpy` by using the `binarypow` function to find the modular inverse of (n-k)!.

The `main` function calculates the answer as follows:
1. It calculates 2^n - 1 modulo r and stores it in `ans`.
2. It calculates C(n, a) using the `combination` function and subtracts it from `ans`.
3. If `ans` is less than or equal to 0, it adds r to `ans` and takes the modulo r again to ensure `ans` is non-negative.
4. It calculates C(n, b) using the `combination` function and subtracts it from `ans`.
5. Again, if `ans` is less than or equal to 0, it adds r to `ans` and takes the modulo r again.

Let's calculate the output step by step:
- binarypow(2, 4) = 16 modulo r = 16
- ans = 16 - 1 = 15
- combination(4, 1) calculates 4! / (1! * 3!) modulo r = 4
- ans = 15 - 4 = 11
- ans is positive, so no need to add r and take modulo again.
- combination(4, 3) calculates 4! / (3! * 1!) modulo r = 4
- ans = 11 - 4 = 7
- ans is positive, so no need to add r and take modulo again.

The final answer is 7.
