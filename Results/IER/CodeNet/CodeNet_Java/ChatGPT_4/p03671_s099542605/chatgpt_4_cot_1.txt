<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two ArrayLists, one for integers (`num`) and one for strings (`param`). It also initializes an integer `system` with the value 0, which is used to control whether to split the input by spaces or not.

The `while` loop reads input until there is no more input. Since the input `700 600 780` consists only of integers, the `if (sc.hasNextInt())` condition is always true, and the integers are added to the `num` ArrayList. The `else` block is never executed because there are no non-integer inputs.

After the loop, the `Method` function is called with the `num` ArrayList as an argument. Inside the `Method` function, the `num` ArrayList is sorted in ascending order, which will sort the input numbers to `600 700 780`.

Finally, the `Method` function prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted `num` ArrayList, which are the smallest two numbers. The sum of `600` and `700` is `1300`.

1300
