<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized with 3 and 8 respectively according to the input. The boolean variable flg is initialized with false.
The code enters a for loop and iterates from 0 to x (inclusive), which means it will iterate from 0 to 3.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of 2 times the current loop index i and 4 times the difference between x and i. This sum represents the total number of legs if i is the number of cranes (each with 2 legs) and x-i is the number of turtles (each with 4 legs).
The loop checks if the calculated sum equals y (which is 8). If it does, it sets flg to true and breaks out of the loop.
The loop will iterate and calculate the following sums:
- For i = 0: sum = 2*0 + 4*(3-0) = 12 (does not equal 8)
- For i = 1: sum = 2*1 + 4*(3-1) = 10 (does not equal 8)
- For i = 2: sum = 2*2 + 4*(3-2) = 8 (equals 8)

Since the sum equals y when i is 2, flg is set to true and the loop breaks.
After the loop, the code checks the value of flg. Since flg is true, it prints "Yes".
