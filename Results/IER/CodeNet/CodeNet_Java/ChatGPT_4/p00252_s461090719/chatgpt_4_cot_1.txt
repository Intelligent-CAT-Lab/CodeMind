<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three integer variables b1, b2, and b3 with the input values. According to the input, b1 is set to 0, b2 is set to 0, and b3 is set to 1.

The first if statement checks if any of the following conditions are true:
- b1 is 1, b2 is 0, and b3 is 0
- b1 is 0, b2 is 1, and b3 is 0
- b1 is 0, b2 is 0, and b3 is 0

Since none of these conditions are true for the input (0, 0, 1), the code does not enter the first if block and does not print "Close".

The code then proceeds to the else block, which contains another if statement. This if statement checks if either of the following conditions is true:
- b1 is 1, b2 is 1, and b3 is 0
- b1 is 0, b2 is 0, and b3 is 1

The second condition (b1 is 0, b2 is 0, and b3 is 1) matches the input, so the code enters this if block and prints "Open".

<<<Output>>>
Open
