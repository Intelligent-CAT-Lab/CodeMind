<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value and assigns it to the variable X.

The input provided is `5`, so X is set to 5.

The code then checks if X is equal to 3, 5, or 7 using a series of if-else statements. If X matches any of these values, it prints "YES". If X does not match any of these values, it prints "NO".

Since the input is 5, the condition X==5 is true. Therefore, the code will execute the corresponding block and print "YES".

<<<Output>>>
YES
