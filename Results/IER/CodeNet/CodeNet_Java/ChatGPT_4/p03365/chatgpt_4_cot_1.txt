The input provided is `4`, which is read by the `MyScan` class and passed to the `solve` method of the `TaskC` class as the variable `i`.

The `solve` method initializes an array `md` of longs with size `i` (which is 4 in this case). It also initializes two integers `rm` and `lx` with the value `i - 2` (which is 2).

A while loop is executed with the condition `rm >= 0`. Inside the loop, the `md` array is filled with values calculated by the `Util.c` method, which computes combinations using the formula `ifact[a] * ifact[b - a] % _m * fact[b] % _m`. The `rm` and `lx` variables are decremented by 2 and 1 respectively in each iteration. This loop runs only once because `rm` becomes negative after the first iteration.

Next, a `for` loop is executed with `m` ranging from 1 to `i - 1` (3 in this case). Inside the loop, the variable `cur` is calculated using the factorial of `m` and `i - m - 1` multiplied by the corresponding value from the `md` array, all modulo `_m` (which is a large prime number `1000_000_007`).

The result `res` is incremented by the difference between `cur` and `prev` (initially 0), multiplied by `m`, and taken modulo `_m`. The `prev` variable is then updated to the value of `cur`.

After the loop, the final result `res` is printed modulo `_m`.

The Util class has static initialization blocks that precompute factorials (`fact`), modular inverses (`inv`), and inverse factorials (`ifact`) up to 1,000,001. These precomputed values are used in the `c` and `fact` methods to calculate combinations and factorials efficiently.

Given the input `4`, the output will be the result of the computations described above, modulo `1000_000_007`.

Let's calculate the output step by step:
- `md` array will have values only at index 2 and 3 after the while loop.
- `md[2]` will be `Util.c(0, 2)` which is `1`.
- `md[3]` will be `Util.c(2, 3)` which is `3`.
- In the for loop, `m` takes values 1, 2, and 3.
- For `m = 1`, `cur = Util.fact(1) * Util.fact(2) % _m * md[1]` (md[1] is 0 since it was not set in the while loop).
- For `m = 2`, `cur = Util.fact(2) * Util.fact(1) % _m * md[2]` which is `2 * 1 % _m * 1`.
- For `m = 3`, `cur = Util.fact(3) * Util.fact(0) % _m * md[3]` which is `6 * 1 % _m * 3`.

The final result `res` will be the sum of the above computations modulo `_m`.

Let's compute the final result:
- For `m = 1`, `cur` is 0, so `res` remains 0.
- For `m = 2`, `cur` is `2 * 1 * 1 % _m` which is 2, so `res` is `(2 - 0 + _m) * 2 % _m` which is 4.
- For `m = 3`, `cur` is `6 * 1 * 3 % _m` which is 18, so `res` is `res + (18 - 2 + _m) * 3 % _m` which is `4 + 48 % _m` which is 52.

Therefore, the final output will be `res % _m` which is `52 % 1000_000_007`.
