The input `1 3 2` initializes the variables H, W, and K with 1, 3, and 2 respectively. The `Main` class is instantiated with these values, and the `countIt` method is called with the goal of 2.

The `createUnitAmida` method is called with the width W = 3. It generates all possible unit Amida numbers for a width of 3. The unit Amida numbers are numbers that do not have consecutive 1s in their binary representation and are less than 2^(W-1) which is 4 in this case. The possible unit Amida numbers are 0, 1, and 2 (in binary: 00, 01, and 10).

The `countIt` method calls `countSub` with the parameters (height = 1, start = 1, goal = 2). Since the height is 1, the method will not recurse and will instead calculate the result based on the unit Amida numbers.

The `countSub` method checks the unit Amida numbers and increments rCase, lCase, or mCase depending on whether the right or left bit is set or neither. For the unit Amida numbers 0, 1, and 2 (in binary: 00, 01, and 10), rCase will be incremented for the number 2 (binary 10), lCase will be incremented for the number 1 (binary 01), and mCase will be incremented for the number 0 (binary 00).

Since the start is 1 and the goal is 2, the result will be equal to rCase, which is 1 because there is only one unit Amida number (binary 10) that allows a transition from position 1 to position 2.

Finally, the result is printed out, which is 1.
