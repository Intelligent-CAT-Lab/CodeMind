The input `2 2 1` initializes the variables n, h, and D with 2, 2, and 1 respectively. The variable f is initialized with 1, and fs is initialized with 1 as well. The mod variable is set to 1000000007.

The for loop runs from i = 1 to n-1 (which is 1 in this case), and it calculates the factorial of i+1 modulo mod and adds it to fs. After the loop, fs is 2.

Next, a Fenwick tree (binary indexed tree) ft is created with a size of h+5 (which is 7 in this case). The initial values of the Fenwick tree at indices 0 and 1 are set to f and mod-f respectively.

The variable ans is initialized with 0. A for loop runs from i = 0 to h (which is 2 in this case). Inside the loop, the current sum at index i of the Fenwick tree is retrieved and stored in cur. If i+D is greater than or equal to h, cur is added to ans. Then, cur is multiplied by fs modulo mod and added to the Fenwick tree at index i+1. If i+D+1 is less than or equal to h, mod-cur is added to the Fenwick tree at index i+D+1.

After the loop, the final value of ans modulo mod is printed.

Let's go through the loop iterations:
- For i = 0: cur = 1, ans remains 0, cur is updated to 2, and the Fenwick tree is updated at indices 1 and 2 with values 2 and mod-2.
- For i = 1: cur = 2, ans remains 0, cur is updated to 4, and the Fenwick tree is updated at indices 2 and 3 with values 4 and mod-4.

Finally, ans is 0, and that is the output modulo mod.
