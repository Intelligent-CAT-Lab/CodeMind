<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized with 7, 5, and 1 respectively according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with "NO".
The code then calls the gcd function with b and a % b as arguments, which are 5 and 2 respectively (since 7 % 5 is 2).
The gcd function works as follows:
- gcd(5, 2): Since y is not 0, it calls gcd(2, 5 % 2).
- gcd(2, 1): Since y is not 0, it calls gcd(1, 2 % 1).
- gcd(1, 0): Since y is 0, it returns x, which is 1.

So the gcd of 5 and 2 is 1.

Back in the main method, it checks if c % gcd(b, a % b) == 0, which translates to 1 % 1 == 0. Since 1 % 1 is indeed 0, the condition is true, and ans is set to "YES".
Finally, the program prints the value of ans, which is "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
