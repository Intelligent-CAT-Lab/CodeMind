<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `0`. The `FastScanner` class is used to read this input and parse it as a long integer, which is stored in the variable `n`.

The main logic of the program is to count how many times you can multiply the number 1 by 2 before it becomes greater than `n`. The variable `s` is initialized to 1, and the variable `count` is initialized to 0.

The program enters a while loop that continues until `s` is greater than `n`. Since `n` is 0, the condition `s > n` is true on the first check because `s` is initialized to 1, which is greater than 0. Therefore, the loop breaks immediately without entering the body of the loop.

Since the loop body, which contains the multiplication of `s` by 2 and the increment of `count`, is never executed, the value of `count` remains 0.

The program then prints the value of `count`, which is 0.
