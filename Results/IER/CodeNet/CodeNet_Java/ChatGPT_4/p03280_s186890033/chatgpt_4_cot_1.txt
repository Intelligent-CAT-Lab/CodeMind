<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input, which are 2 and 2 respectively according to the given input.

The code then calculates the expression `a * b - (a + b - 1)` with the values of a and b that were input. Substituting the values we get:

`2 * 2 - (2 + 2 - 1) = 4 - (4 - 1) = 4 - 3 = 1`

The result of the calculation is then printed to the standard output.
