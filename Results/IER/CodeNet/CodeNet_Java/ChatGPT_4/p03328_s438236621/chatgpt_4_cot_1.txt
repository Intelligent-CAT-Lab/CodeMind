<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the input, which are 8 and 13 respectively. It then calls the solve method with these two integers as arguments.

Inside the solve method, it calculates the result using the formula:
(b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2 - b

Substituting the values of a and b:
(13 - 8 + 1) * (13 - 8) / 2 - 13
(6) * (5) / 2 - 13
30 / 2 - 13
15 - 13
2

The result of the calculation is 2, which is then returned to the main method and printed to the console.

<<<Output>>>
2
