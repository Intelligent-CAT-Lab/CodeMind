<<<Analysis>>>
The input `5 7 9` is read and split into an array of strings `strArr`, which is then parsed into three integers `A[0] = 5`, `A[1] = 7`, and `A[2] = 9`. These values represent the three cards in the problem statement.

The program then calculates the sum of these three card values: `5 + 7 + 9 = 21`.

The condition `A[0] + A[1] + A[2] >= 22` is checked. Since `21` is not greater than or equal to `22`, the condition is false, and the program prints "win" as the output.

<<<Output>>>
win
