The input string `rand` is initialized with `\\//`. The `down` stack and `s` deque are used to keep track of the positions of the backslashes and the sizes of the pools formed by the slashes, respectively.

The for loop iterates over each character in the input string:
- At index 0, the character is `\`, so the index 0 is pushed onto the `down` stack.
- At index 1, the character is `\`, so the index 1 is pushed onto the `down` stack.
- At index 2, the character is `/`, so the `down` stack is not empty and the top element (index 1) is popped. A new `Pool` object is created with `j = 1` and `s = 2 - 1 = 1` (the size of the pool). Since the `s` deque is empty, the `Pool` object is added to it. The `sum` is incremented by `1`.
- At index 3, the character is `/`, so the `down` stack is not empty and the top element (index 0) is popped. A new `Pool` object is created with `j = 0` and `s = 3 - 0 = 3` (the size of the pool). The `s` deque is not empty, but since `j = 0` is not less than the last element's `j` in the `s` deque, the new `Pool` object is added to the `s` deque. The `sum` is incremented by `3`.

After the loop, the `sum` is `4` (1 + 3), which is the total size of the pools.

The StringBuilder `sb` is used to build the output string. It starts with the size of the `s` deque, which is `1`. Then it appends the size of each pool in the `s` deque, which is `4`.

The output is the total size of the pools followed by the number of pools and the sizes of each pool.
