The input provided is `2 2`, which means `n = 2` and `m = 2`.

The `Combinations` class is instantiated with a length of `n + 3 * m` which is `2 + 3 * 2 = 8`, and the modulus `MiscUtils.MODF` which is `998244353`.

The `solve` method of `TaskC` class calculates the `answer` using two loops.

In the first loop, `i` goes from `2 * m` to `3 * m` with a step of 2, which means `i` takes the values 4 and 6. The loop calculates a partial answer by multiplying two combinations and adding them to `answer`:
- For `i = 4`, the combination is `c(2 - 1 + 4 / 2, 2 - 1) * c(2, 3 * 2 - 4) % 998244353` which simplifies to `c(4, 1) * c(2, 2) % 998244353`.
- For `i = 6`, the combination is `c(2 - 1 + 6 / 2, 2 - 1) * c(2, 3 * 2 - 6) % 998244353` which simplifies to `c(5, 1) * c(2, 0) % 998244353`.

The second loop calculates `delta` by summing combinations from `2 * m + 1` to `3 * m`, which means `i` takes the values 5 and 6. The loop calculates `delta` as:
- For `i = 5`, the combination is `c(2 + 3 * 2 - 5 - 2, 2 - 2)` which simplifies to `c(3, 0)`.
- For `i = 6`, the combination is `c(2 + 3 * 2 - 6 - 2, 2 - 2)` which simplifies to `c(2, 0)`.

The `delta` is then reduced modulo `998244353` and subtracted from `answer` multiplied by `n`, and then the result is again reduced modulo `998244353`. Finally, `998244353` is added to `answer` and the result is reduced modulo `998244353` again to ensure a non-negative result.

The `printLine` method of `OutputWriter` class is then called to print the final `answer`.

The actual values of the combinations depend on the implementation of the `generateFactorial` and `generateReverseFactorials` methods in the `IntegerUtils` class, which are used to calculate the combinations. Since the code for these methods is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact values of the combinations and thus the exact output. However, the process described above is how the code would process the input to generate the output.

<<<Output>>>
The output cannot be determined without the implementation details of the `generateFactorial` and `generateReverseFactorials` methods.
