<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is initialized with "abac". The variables a, b, and c are initialized with 0.
The program enters a for loop and iterates over each character of the string S.

1. The first character is 'a', so variable a is incremented by 1 (a = 1).
2. The second character is 'b', so variable b is incremented by 1 (b = 1).
3. The third character is 'a', so variable a is incremented by 1 (a = 2).
4. The fourth character is 'c', so variable c is incremented by 1 (c = 1).

After the loop, the values of a, b, and c are 2, 1, and 1 respectively.

The program then checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' is less than or equal to 1. In this case, the maximum count is 2 (for 'a') and the minimum count is 1 (for both 'b' and 'c'), so the difference is 1, which satisfies the condition.

Since the condition is true, the program prints "YES".

YES
