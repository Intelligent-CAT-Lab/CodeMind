<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided initializes N with 2 and MOD with 998244353. The program then initializes a 2D array 'table' with dimensions [N + 1][N + 1], which in this case is [3][3].

The first for loop initializes the last row of the table with values from 0 to N (inclusive). Since N is 2, the last row of 'table' is set to [0, 1, 2].

The second for loop fills the rest of the table. It starts from the second last row (index N - 1, which is 1) and goes up to the first row (index 1). For each position 'pos', it iterates over all possible remainders 'rem' from 0 to N (inclusive).

For each 'pos' and 'rem', it first copies the value from the row below (table[pos + 1][rem]) to the current cell (table[pos][rem]). Then it calculates the minimum factor, which is the smaller of 'pos' and 'N + 1 - pos'. In this case, since 'pos' is 1, the factor will always be 1.

If the factor is less than 'rem', it adds the value of the cell in the same row but 'factor' columns to the left (table[pos][rem - factor]) to the current cell value, and takes the result modulo MOD. Since MOD is a large prime number, it effectively ensures that the result stays within the bounds of an integer.

For the given input, the table is filled as follows:
- table[2][0] = 0, table[2][1] = 1, table[2][2] = 2 (from the first for loop)
- table[1][0] = table[2][0] = 0
- table[1][1] = table[2][1] + table[1][0] = 1 + 0 = 1
- table[1][2] = table[2][2] + table[1][1] = 2 + 1 = 3

Finally, the program prints the value of table[1][N], which is table[1][2] = 3.
