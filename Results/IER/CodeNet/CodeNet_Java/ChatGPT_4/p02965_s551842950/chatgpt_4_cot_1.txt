<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 2` initializes the variables `n` and `m` with the values 2 and 2, respectively. The `mod` variable is set to 998244353.

The `fact` array is initialized with a size of 3000001, and its elements are filled with the factorial of the index modulo `mod`. The factorial is calculated iteratively, using the previous factorial value multiplied by the current index, and then taking the modulo.

The `getAns` function is called with parameters `n`, `3*m`, and `2*m`, which translates to `getAns(2, 6, 4)`. This function calculates a value based on the given parameters and returns it modulo `mod`.

The `ans` variable is initialized with the result of `getAns(2, 6, 4)`.

A for loop iterates from `m+1` to `n`, which in this case is just the value 3 since `m` is 2 and `n` is 2. However, since the loop condition is `numOnes <= n` and `numOnes` starts at 3, the loop does not execute.

The result stored in `ans` is printed out.

The `getAns` function will calculate as follows:
- `choose(7, 1)` which is `7` (7 choose 1 is 7)
- `choose(2, 1)` which is `2` (2 choose 1 is 2)
- The calculation becomes `7 - (2 * 2) % mod + mod`, which simplifies to `7 - 4 + mod`
- The result is `3 + mod`, which is `998244356`
- Taking modulo `mod` gives `3` as the final result for `getAns(2, 6, 4)`

Therefore, the final answer printed out is `3`.
