The input provided is `6`. The `InputReader` class reads this input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The `CGoHome` class has a method `solve` which is called with `n` as the parameter.

The variable `ans` is initialized to `0` and `sum` is also initialized to `0`. A for loop starts with `i` initialized to `1` and continues as long as `sum` is less than `n`.

In each iteration of the loop, `i` is added to `sum` and `ans` is incremented by `1`. The loop will continue until `sum` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.

Let's calculate the sum and ans for each iteration:
- Iteration 1: i = 1, sum = 0 + 1 = 1, ans = 0 + 1 = 1
- Iteration 2: i = 2, sum = 1 + 2 = 3, ans = 1 + 1 = 2
- Iteration 3: i = 3, sum = 3 + 3 = 6, ans = 2 + 1 = 3

At this point, `sum` is equal to `n`, so the loop stops.

The `OutputWriter` class then prints the value of `ans`, which is `3`.
