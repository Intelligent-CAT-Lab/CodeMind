<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then initializes an integer variable ans to 0.

The code reads two integers from the input, a and b, which are 20 and 30 respectively according to the given input.

The Math.abs function is called with the difference of a and b (20 - 30), which results in -10. The absolute value of -10 is 10.

The value of ans is set to this absolute value, which is 10.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 10.

<<<Output>>>
10
