<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and initializes a boolean array `dir` of size 4, which is used to track the presence of the four cardinal directions: North (N), South (S), East (E), and West (W).

The input string "SENW" is processed character by character in a for loop. For each character, the corresponding index in the `dir` array is set to true if the character is 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W'. The indexes correspond to the directions as follows: 0 for 'N', 1 for 'S', 2 for 'E', and 3 for 'W'.

The input "SENW" contains all four directions, so after the loop, the `dir` array will have true at all indexes: [true, true, true, true].

After processing the input, the code checks if the values at `dir[0]` and `dir[1]` are equal (both true or both false) and if the values at `dir[2]` and `dir[3]` are equal. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Since `dir[0]` is true (for 'N'), `dir[1]` is true (for 'S'), `dir[2]` is true (for 'E'), and `dir[3]` is true (for 'W'), both conditions are met: `dir[0]` equals `dir[1]` and `dir[2]` equals `dir[3]`. Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
