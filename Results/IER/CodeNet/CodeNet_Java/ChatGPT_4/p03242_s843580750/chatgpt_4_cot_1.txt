<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string N from the input, which is "119". It then enters a for loop that iterates three times, corresponding to the indices 0, 1, and 2 of the string N.

During each iteration, the code checks the character at the current index i of the string N:
- If the character is '1', it prints '9'.
- If the character is '9', it prints '1'.
- Otherwise, it prints the character itself.

The loop processes each character of the string "119" as follows:
- For i = 0, N.charAt(i) is '1', so it prints '9'.
- For i = 1, N.charAt(i) is '1', so it prints '9'.
- For i = 2, N.charAt(i) is '9', so it prints '1'.

The output is printed without any spaces or newlines between the characters.
