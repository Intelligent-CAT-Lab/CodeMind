<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the input, which are 8 and 13 respectively. It then calculates the difference between b and a, which is stored in the variable n (n = b - a). In this case, n is 13 - 8, which equals 5.

Next, the code calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2. For n = 5, this results in 5 * (5 + 1) / 2, which equals 15.

Finally, the code subtracts b from this sum and prints the result. So, the final output is 15 - 13, which equals 2.
