<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable sum is initialized with 0.
The code defines a static method get_GCD that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of three numbers a, b, and c. It does this by finding the minimum of the three numbers and then iterating from 1 to this minimum value to find the largest integer that divides all three numbers without a remainder.

The main method reads the input n and initializes sum to 0. It then enters a triple nested loop structure where i, j, and k all range from 1 to n (inclusive). For each combination of i, j, and k, it calls the get_GCD method and adds the result to sum.

Since n is 2, the loops will run for the combinations (1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (1,2,2), (2,1,1), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), and (2,2,2).

The GCD for each combination is as follows:
- GCD(1,1,1) = 1
- GCD(1,1,2) = 1
- GCD(1,2,1) = 1
- GCD(1,2,2) = 1
- GCD(2,1,1) = 1
- GCD(2,1,2) = 1
- GCD(2,2,1) = 1
- GCD(2,2,2) = 2

Adding all these GCDs together gives us the final sum: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9.

Therefore, the output of the code will be 9.
