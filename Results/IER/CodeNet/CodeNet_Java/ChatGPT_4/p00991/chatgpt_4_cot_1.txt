<<<Analysis>>>
The input values are assigned to the variables r, c, a1, a2, b1, and b2, which are initialized with 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, and 3 respectively.

The variables x and y are calculated as the absolute differences between the corresponding a and b coordinates:
- x = |a1 - b1| = |0 - 3| = 3
- y = |a2 - b2| = |0 - 3| = 3

Then, the minimum values between x, r-x and y, c-y are calculated:
- x = min(x, r-x) = min(3, 4-3) = min(3, 1) = 1
- y = min(y, c-y) = min(3, 4-3) = min(3, 1) = 1

The variable C is assigned the minimum value of x and y, which is 1.

The variable z is initialized with 1 and is used to determine if there are multiple shortest paths. Since both x and y are equal to r-x and c-y respectively, z is multiplied by 2 twice, resulting in z = 4.

A BigInteger b is initialized with the value of 1. A for loop runs from i = 0 to i < C (which is 1), so it will run only once. Inside the loop, b is multiplied by the BigInteger representation of (x+y-i) and divided by the BigInteger representation of (i+1). Since x, y, and i are all 1, this results in b being multiplied by (1+1-0) and divided by (0+1), which simplifies to b = b * 2 / 1 = 2.

Finally, the result is calculated by multiplying b (which is 2) by z (which is 4) and taking the modulus with 100000007. The final result is (2 * 4) % 100000007 = 8 % 100000007 = 8.
