<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with the `main` method, an `AtCoder` class with a constructor and a `solve` method, and a `FastScanner` class for efficient input reading.

The `main` method creates an instance of `FastScanner` and `PrintWriter`, then creates an instance of `AtCoder` by passing the `FastScanner` instance to its constructor. It then calls the `solve` method of the `AtCoder` instance, passing the `PrintWriter` instance to it, and finally flushes the `PrintWriter`.

The `AtCoder` class constructor reads two integers, `A` and `B`, using the `nextInt` method of the `FastScanner` instance. In this case, `A` is 5 and `B` is 3.

The `solve` method of the `AtCoder` class compares `A` and `B`. Since `A` is greater than `B`, it calculates `2 * A - 1`, which is `2 * 5 - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9`, and prints this value using the `PrintWriter` instance.

The `FastScanner` class is a utility class for fast input reading, which is not directly relevant to the output but is used to read the input efficiently.

Given the input `5 3`, the `solve` method will execute the second condition (`A > B`) and calculate `2 * A - 1`, which results in `9`.
