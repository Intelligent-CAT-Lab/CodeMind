<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integer values from the input. These values are 2 and 1.
It then calculates the absolute difference between these two numbers using Math.abs(2 - 1), which results in 1.
The code checks if this absolute difference is less than or equal to 1 using the conditional expression (1 <= 1).
Since the condition is true, the ternary operator returns "Brown".
Finally, the program prints "Brown" to the output.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
