<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "sippuu". The code checks if the character at index 2 is the same as the character at index 3, and if the character at index 4 is the same as the character at index 5. In the given string "sippuu", the character at index 2 is 'p' and the character at index 3 is also 'p'. The character at index 4 is 'u' and the character at index 5 is also 'u'. Since both conditions are true, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
