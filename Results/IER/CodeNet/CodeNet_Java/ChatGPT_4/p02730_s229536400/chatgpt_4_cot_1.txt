<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is initialized with "akasaka". The program then checks if the string S and its two substrings are palindromes by calling the check method.

1. First, it checks if the entire string "akasaka" is a palindrome. The check method compares each character from the start and end of the string moving towards the center. Since "akasaka" is a palindrome, the check method returns true.

2. Next, it checks the substring of S from the start to the middle of the string, excluding the center character. The substring is "aka" (from index 0 to index (7-1)/2 which is 3). The check method confirms that "aka" is a palindrome and returns true.

3. Finally, it checks the substring of S from the character after the center to the end of the string. The substring is "saka" (from index ((7+3)/2)-1 which is 4 to the end). The check method confirms that "saka" is a palindrome and returns true.

Since all three checks return true, the variable anskey is set to true, and the program prints "Yes".
