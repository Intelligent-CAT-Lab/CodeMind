<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a single number `12`. The `TaskX` class's `solve` method is called with this input.

1. The `nextLong` method of `MyInput` class reads the input `12` and assigns it to the variable `n`.
2. The `solve` method checks if `n` is odd by `n % 2 == 1`. Since `12` is even, it does not print `0` and continues.
3. It initializes `ans` to `0` and `base` to `10`.
4. It enters a while loop that continues as long as `base` is less than or equal to `n`.
5. In the first iteration, `base` is `10`, which is less than `12`, so it enters the loop.
6. It calculates `ans += n / base`, which is `ans += 12 / 10`, resulting in `ans = 1` because it's integer division.
7. It multiplies `base` by `5`, resulting in `base = 50`.
8. The while loop condition `base > n` is now true because `50` is greater than `12`, so it breaks out of the loop.
9. It prints the value of `ans`, which is `1`.
