The variable r is initialized with the value 2.0 according to the input. The variable pi is assigned the value of Math.PI, which is the constant value of π (approximately 3.14159).
The variable x is calculated as the area of a circle with radius r, using the formula area = π * r^2. With r = 2.0, the area x is calculated as 2.0 * 2.0 * π, which equals 4.0 * π.
The variable y is calculated as the circumference of a circle with radius r, using the formula circumference = 2 * π * r. With r = 2.0, the circumference y is calculated as 2 * π * 2.0, which equals 4.0 * π.
The program then prints the values of x and y formatted to six decimal places using printf. The output will be the area and circumference of a circle with radius 2.0, each formatted to six decimal places.
