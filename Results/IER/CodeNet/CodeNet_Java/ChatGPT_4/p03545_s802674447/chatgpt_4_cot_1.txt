The input string "1222" is read and each character of the string is converted to an integer and stored in the array `a`. The array `a` will contain the digits [1, 2, 2, 2].

The code then enters a loop that iterates over all possible combinations of adding and subtracting the numbers in `a` to find a combination that equals 7. This is done by using a bit mask with the second loop, which iterates from 0 to 7 (which is 2^3 - 1, representing all combinations of three operations).

For each iteration, the variable `num` is initialized with the value of `a[0]`, which is 1. The inner loop then checks each bit of the iterator `i` to decide whether to add or subtract the next number in the array `a`.

The combinations of operations are as follows:
- i = 0 (000 in binary): 1 - 2 - 2 - 2 = -5
- i = 1 (001 in binary): 1 - 2 - 2 + 2 = -1
- i = 2 (010 in binary): 1 - 2 + 2 - 2 = -1
- i = 3 (011 in binary): 1 - 2 + 2 + 2 = 3
- i = 4 (100 in binary): 1 + 2 - 2 - 2 = -1
- i = 5 (101 in binary): 1 + 2 - 2 + 2 = 3
- i = 6 (110 in binary): 1 + 2 + 2 - 2 = 3
- i = 7 (111 in binary): 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7

When `i` is 7, the condition `num == 7` is met. The corresponding operations are '+', '+', '+', and the output string is constructed as "1+2+2+2=7".

The output string "1+2+2+2=7" is printed, and the program returns, ending the execution.
