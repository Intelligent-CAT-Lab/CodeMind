<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "01B0". A new StringBuilder `sb` is created to build the final string.
The for loop iterates over each character of the input string "01B0".

1. i = 0, c = '0': '0' is not 'B', so '0' is appended to `sb`.
2. i = 1, c = '1': '1' is not 'B', so '1' is appended to `sb`. `sb` now contains "01".
3. i = 2, c = 'B': 'B' is equal to 'B', so the last character of `sb` is deleted. `sb` now contains "0".
4. i = 3, c = '0': '0' is not 'B', so '0' is appended to `sb`. `sb` now contains "00".

After the loop finishes, the final content of `sb` is "00", which is printed as the output.
