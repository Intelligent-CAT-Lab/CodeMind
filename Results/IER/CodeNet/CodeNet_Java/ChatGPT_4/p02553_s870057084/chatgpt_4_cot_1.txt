<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads four BigInteger values a, b, c, and d with the values 1, 2, 1, and 1 respectively according to the input.

The code then calculates the following products using BigInteger's multiply method:
- ac = a * c = 1 * 1 = 1
- ad = a * d = 1 * 1 = 1
- bd = b * d = 2 * 1 = 2
- bc = b * c = 2 * 1 = 2

After calculating these products, the code uses the max method of BigInteger to find the maximum value among ac, ad, bc, and bd. Since bd and bc both have the value 2, and ac and ad both have the value 1, the maximum value is 2.

Finally, the code prints out the maximum value, which is 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
