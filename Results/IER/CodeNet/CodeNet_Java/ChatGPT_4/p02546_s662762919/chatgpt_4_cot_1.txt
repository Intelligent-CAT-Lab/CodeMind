<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads a single word as a string into the variable `t` and closes the scanner as it's no longer needed.

The input provided is "apple". The code checks if the string `t` ends with the letter "s" using the `endsWith` method. If it does, it will append "es" to the string; if it does not, it will append "s" to the string.

In this case, "apple" does not end with "s", so the `else` block is executed, and "s" is concatenated to "apple" using the `concat` method.

Finally, the modified string "apples" is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
apples
