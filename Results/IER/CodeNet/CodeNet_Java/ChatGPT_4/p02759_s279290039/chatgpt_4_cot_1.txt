<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable N, which is set to 5 based on the given input.

The code checks if N is an even number by using the modulus operator (N%2). If N is even, it prints the result of N divided by 2. If N is odd, it prints the result of (N/2) + 1.

Since the input is 5, which is an odd number, the condition (N%2==0) evaluates to false. Therefore, the else block is executed, and the output is calculated as (5/2) + 1. Integer division of 5 by 2 yields 2 (since integer division truncates the decimal part), and adding 1 gives us 3.

3
