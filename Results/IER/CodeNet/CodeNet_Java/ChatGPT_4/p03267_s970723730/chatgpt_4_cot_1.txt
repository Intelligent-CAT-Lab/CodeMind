The variable l is initialized with 4 according to the input. Variables n and m are initialized with 0.
The while loop is used to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to l. It increments n until 2 raised to the power of n is greater than l. After the loop, n is decremented by 1 to correct the overshoot. For l = 4, the loop runs until n is 3, then n is decremented to 2.
A StringBuilder object sb is created to build the output string.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
A for loop is used to iterate over the bits of l, from 0 to n-2 (since n is 2, the loop will run for bit = 0).
Inside the loop, two lines are appended to sb for each bit. The first line represents an edge with weight 0 from node bit+1 to node bit+2. The second line represents an edge with weight 2^bit from node bit+1 to node bit+2. The variable m is incremented twice for these two edges.
Additionally, if the bit-th bit of l is set (which is true for bit = 0 in this case), another line is appended to sb representing an edge from node bit+1 to node n with weight l-sum-(1<<bit). The variable sum is updated by adding 2^bit to it, and m is incremented.
After the loop, the output prints the number of nodes n and the number of edges m, followed by the content of sb.
For the input 4, the output will be:
2 nodes (since the highest power of 2 less than or equal to 4 is 2^2 = 4, and n is decremented to 2)
3 edges (since there are two edges with weights 0 and 1 from the first loop iteration, and one additional edge added because the 0-th bit of l is set)
The edges are:
1 -> 2 with weight 0
1 -> 2 with weight 1
1 -> 2 with weight 3 (since l-sum-(1<<bit) is 4-0-1 = 3)
