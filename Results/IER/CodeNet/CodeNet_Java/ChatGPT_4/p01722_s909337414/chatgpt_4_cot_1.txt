<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single line of input and converts it into an integer, which is stored in the variable `mjs`. The input provided is `0`, so `mjs` is set to 0.

The code then checks the value of `mjs` against several conditions using if-else statements:
- If `mjs` is 0, it prints "1".
- If `mjs` is 1, it prints "2".
- If `mjs` is 2, it prints "1".
- If `mjs` is greater than or equal to 3, it prints "0".

Since the input is `0`, the first condition is met, and the code will print "1".
