The code is designed to calculate the angle of a slope formed by pouring water into a rectangular container. The input consists of three integers: `a`, `b`, and `x`. These represent the width and height of the container and the volume of water poured into it, respectively.

Given the input `2 2 4`, the variables `a`, `b`, and `x` are initialized with the values 2, 2, and 4, respectively.

The code then calculates the height of the water in the container using the formula `height = (double)x / (a * a)`. With the given input, this results in `height = 4 / (2 * 2) = 1.0`.

Next, the code determines the angle of the slope of the water surface using two different formulas, depending on whether the water height is less than or equal to half the height of the container (`b / 2d`). Since `height = 1.0` and `b / 2d = 1.0`, the condition `height <= b / 2d` is true.

Therefore, the code uses the first formula to calculate the angle: `ans = a * b * b / (2d * x)`. Plugging in the values, we get `ans = 2 * 2 * 2 / (2 * 4) = 1.0`.

The angle in radians is then converted to degrees using `Math.toDegrees(Math.atan(ans))`. The `Math.atan` function calculates the arctangent of the given value, and `Math.toDegrees` converts the result from radians to degrees.

The arctangent of 1.0 is Ï€/4 radians, or 45 degrees. Therefore, the final output will be 45 degrees.

Finally, the code prints the result using a `PrintWriter` and flushes the stream to ensure the output is displayed.
