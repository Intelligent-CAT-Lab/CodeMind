<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a single integer `7`, which is read by the `LightScanner` class and stored in the variable `n`. The `I3y3sChallenge` class's `solve` method is then called with this value.

The `solve` method first checks if `n` is equal to `2`. If it were, it would output `-1` and return. However, since `n` is `7`, this condition is not met, and the method proceeds to the next part.

The method initializes a 2D array `ans` with dimensions `n` by `n-1`, which in this case is `7` by `6`.

The first nested for loop fills the 2D array `ans` with values. For each row `i` from `0` to `n-2` (which is `6`), and for each column `j` from `0` to `n-2`, it checks if `i` is equal to `j`. If so, it sets `ans[i][j]` to `n` (which is `7`). Otherwise, it sets `ans[i][j]` to `j+1`.

The second for loop fills the last row of the array `ans[n-1]` with values. For each column `i` from `0` to `n-2`, it sets `ans[n-1][i]` to `(i+1) % (n-1) + 1`. This effectively rotates the numbers `1` to `n-1` (which is `6`) in the last row.

Finally, the method prints the 2D array `ans` row by row using the `LightWriter` class. Each row is printed as a sequence of integers separated by spaces, followed by a newline.

Let's calculate the contents of the `ans` array:

For the first `6` rows (i.e., `i` from `0` to `5`), the diagonal elements (`ans[i][i]`) will be `7`, and the other elements will be the column index plus `1`. So the first `6` rows will look like this:

```
1 2 3 4 5 7
1 2 3 4 7 6
1 2 3 7 5 6
1 2 7 4 5 6
1 7 3 4 5 6
7 2 3 4 5 6
```

For the last row (`i` is `6`), the values will be a rotation of the numbers `1` to `6`:

```
2 3 4 5 6 1
```

The output will be the `ans` array printed row by row.
