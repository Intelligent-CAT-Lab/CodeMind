<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X and Y are initialized with 4 and 10 respectively according to the input.
The variable i is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and checks if the expression `((X-1)*i +1) < Y` is true. If it is true, it increments i by 1 and checks the condition again.
The loop continues until the condition is false.

Let's calculate the value of the expression for each iteration:
- For i = 0: ((4-1)*0 + 1) = 1 < 10 (true)
- For i = 1: ((4-1)*1 + 1) = 4 < 10 (true)
- For i = 2: ((4-1)*2 + 1) = 7 < 10 (true)
- For i = 3: ((4-1)*3 + 1) = 10 < 10 (false)

The loop stops when i = 3 because the condition is no longer true.
The final value of i, which is 3, is printed as the output.
