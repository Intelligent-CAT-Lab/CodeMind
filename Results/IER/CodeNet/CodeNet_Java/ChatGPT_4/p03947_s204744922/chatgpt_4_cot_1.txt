<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "BBBWW". The variable `c` is initialized with the first character of the string, which is 'B'. The variable `sum` is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates over each character of the string "BBBWW". The if condition checks if the current character is different from the character stored in `c`. If it is different, `sum` is incremented by 1 and `c` is updated to the current character.
The loop starts with `i = 0` and `c = 'B'`. Since `c` is equal to `s.charAt(i)`, which is also 'B', `sum` is not incremented.
The loop continues with `i = 1` and `c = 'B'`. Since `c` is equal to `s.charAt(i)`, which is also 'B', `sum` is not incremented.
The loop continues with `i = 2` and `c = 'B'`. Since `c` is equal to `s.charAt(i)`, which is also 'B', `sum` is not incremented.
The loop continues with `i = 3` and `c = 'B'`. Since `c` is not equal to `s.charAt(i)`, which is 'W', `sum` is incremented to 1 and `c` is updated to 'W'.
The loop continues with `i = 4` and `c = 'W'`. Since `c` is equal to `s.charAt(i)`, which is also 'W', `sum` is not incremented.
The loop ends as there are no more characters in the string.
Finally, the program prints the value of `sum`, which is 1.
