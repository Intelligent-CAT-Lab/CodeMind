<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then declares four integer variables: a, b, c, and sum. However, only variable a is used in the code, and variables b and c are declared but never used.

The variable a is assigned the value from the input, which is 68 in this case.

The code then calculates the value of sum by subtracting 30 from the value of a and then dividing the result by 2. The calculation is as follows:
sum = (68 - 30) / 2
sum = 38 / 2
sum = 19

Finally, the code prints the value of sum to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
19
