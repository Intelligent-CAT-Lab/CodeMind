<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer from the input, which is `4` in this case, and stores it in the variable N. It then calculates the expression `(N-1)/2`. For the input `4`, the calculation is `(4-1)/2`, which simplifies to `3/2`. Since both `3` and `2` are integers, the division is integer division, and the result is the integer part of the division, which is `1`. The code then prints this result to the output.
