<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `0`. The variable K is initialized with 0, and N is set to 50. The program then prints the value of N, which is 50.

Next, the program enters a for loop that iterates 50 times (from 0 to 49). Inside the loop, it calculates the value of r for each iteration i using the formula:
r = N - 1 - i + K / N + (K % N > i ? 1 : 0)

Since K is 0, K / N is 0 and K % N is also 0. Therefore, the formula simplifies to:
r = N - 1 - i + 0 + (0 > i ? 1 : 0)

Since 0 is never greater than i in the range of 0 to 49, the ternary operation (0 > i ? 1 : 0) always evaluates to 0. Thus, the formula further simplifies to:
r = N - 1 - i

The program then prints the value of r for each iteration. Since N is 50, the values of r will be:
r = 50 - 1 - i
r = 49 - i

For i from 0 to 49, the values of r will be 49, 48, 47, ..., 1, 0 in descending order.

Finally, the program closes the PrintWriter.
