<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `1900`. The code reads this input and parses it as a long integer, assigning it to the variable `n`.

The main part of the code that generates the output is the following line:
```java
System.out.println((1000-n%1000)==1000?0:1000-n%1000);
```

This line calculates `n % 1000`, which is the remainder of `n` when divided by `1000`. For the input `1900`, `n % 1000` equals `900`.

Then, it calculates `1000 - n % 1000`, which is `1000 - 900`, resulting in `100`.

Next, it checks if `(1000 - n % 1000) == 1000`. Since `100` is not equal to `1000`, this condition is false.

Therefore, the ternary operator will return `1000 - n % 1000`, which we already calculated as `100`.

The output of the code will be `100`.
