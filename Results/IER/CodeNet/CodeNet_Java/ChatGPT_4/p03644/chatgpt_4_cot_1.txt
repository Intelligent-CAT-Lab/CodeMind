<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `7`, which is passed to the `count` method as the parameter `pnum`. The `count` method initializes `result` to `0` and starts a for loop where `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` until `2` raised to the power of `i` is no longer less than or equal to `pnum` (7 in this case).

The loop runs as follows:
- When `i` is `0`, `Math.pow(2, 0)` equals `1`, which is less than `7`, so `result` is set to `1`.
- When `i` is `1`, `Math.pow(2, 1)` equals `2`, which is less than `7`, so `result` is set to `2`.
- When `i` is `2`, `Math.pow(2, 2)` equals `4`, which is less than `7`, so `result` is set to `4`.
- When `i` is `3`, `Math.pow(2, 3)` equals `8`, which is not less than `7`, so the loop stops.

The last value assigned to `result` before the loop stopped was `4`. The `count` method returns `4`, and this value is printed by the `out.println` statement in the `run` method. The `PrintWriter` is then closed, which flushes the output to `System.out`.
