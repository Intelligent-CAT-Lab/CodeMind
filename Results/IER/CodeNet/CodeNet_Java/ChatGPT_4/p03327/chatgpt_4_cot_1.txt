<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `main` method and a class `hayami` that implements `Closeable` and is used for input processing. The `hayami` class has methods to read different types of data from the input stream.

In the `main` method, an instance of `hayami` named `saori` is created. The `saori_hayami` method is called to read an integer from the input. This method internally calls `saorihayami`, which reads a long integer from the input, ensuring it is within the range of an int.

The input provided is `999`. The `saori_hayami` method will parse this input as an integer and store it in the variable `n`.

The `if` statement checks if `n` is less than `1000`. Since `n` is `999`, which is less than `1000`, the condition is true.

Therefore, the program will print "ABC" to the output.

Finally, the `close` method of `saori` is called to close the input stream.
