<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `FastScanner` that is used to read input from the standard input stream. It has methods to read the next token, the next integer, an array of integers, the next long, and a method `nextline` which is not used and returns null.

In the `main` method, an instance of `FastScanner` is created. Two strings `s` and `t` are read from the input using the `next()` method of `FastScanner`. According to the input provided, `s` will be "1" and `t` will be "21".

The two strings are concatenated to form a new string `mah`, which will be "121" after concatenation.

The string `mah` is then parsed into an integer `a`, which will be 121.

The square root of `a` is calculated and stored in `b`, which will be the integer part of the square root of 121. Since the square root of 121 is 11, `b` will be 11.

The code then checks if the square of `b` is equal to `a`. Since 11 * 11 is indeed 121, the condition `b*b==a` is true.

As a result, the code will print "Yes" to the standard output.
