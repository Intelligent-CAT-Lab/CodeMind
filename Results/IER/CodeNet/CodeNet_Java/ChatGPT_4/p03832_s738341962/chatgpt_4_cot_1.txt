The input `3 1 3 1 2` initializes the variables N, A, B, C, and D with the values 3, 1, 3, 1, and 2 respectively. The `solve()` method is called to compute the answer.

The `solve()` method initializes a `FermatCombination` object for combinations modulo MOD (1_000_000_007) and two memoization arrays, MEMO and MEMOCOMB, with special values EMP (-2) to indicate uncomputed states.

The `dfs()` method is called with the initial values of N (3) and A (1). The `dfs()` method checks if the result is already computed in MEMO; if not, it calls `_dfs()` to compute it.

The `_dfs()` method has the following logic:
- If n is 0, it returns 1, as there are no more groups to distribute.
- If g is greater than B, it returns INF, as the group size is too large.
- It then checks if there are enough elements to distribute groups of size g with at least C groups. If not, it sets ans_g to INF.
- If there are enough elements, it calculates the number of ways to distribute the groups of size g, considering the constraints C and D.
- It also recursively calls `dfs()` to calculate the number of ways to distribute the remaining elements with the next group size (g+1).
- The results of distributing groups of size g and g+1 are combined to get the final answer for this state.

The `comb()` method computes the combination of n and k using the precomputed factorial and inverse arrays in the `FermatCombination` class.

The `inverse()` method retrieves the modular inverse of the factorial of a number from the `FermatCombination` class.

The `FermatCombination` class precomputes factorials and their inverses modulo MOD up to a certain size (1000 in this case) to allow fast computation of combinations and inverses.

Given the input `3 1 3 1 2`, the `solve()` method will compute the number of ways to distribute 3 elements into groups with sizes between 1 and 3, with each group having between 1 and 2 elements.

The final answer is computed by the `solve()` method and printed out.
