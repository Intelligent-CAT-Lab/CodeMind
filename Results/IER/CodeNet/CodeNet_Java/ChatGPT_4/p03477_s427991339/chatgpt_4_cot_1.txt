<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes four integer variables a, b, c, and d with the input values 3, 8, 7, and 1 respectively. It then compares the sum of a and b with the sum of c and d.

The sum of a and b is 3 + 8 = 11.
The sum of c and d is 7 + 1 = 8.

Since 11 (the sum of a and b) is greater than 8 (the sum of c and d), the condition in the first if statement (a + b > c + d) is true.

Therefore, the code will execute the block of code inside the first if statement and print "Left".

<<<Output>>>
Left
