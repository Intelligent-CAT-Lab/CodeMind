The input values are as follows:
- w (width of the room) = 10
- h (height of the room) = 10
- v (velocity of the wave) = 1
- t (time) = 10
- x (x-coordinate of the wave source) = 3
- y (y-coordinate of the wave source) = 3
- p (x-coordinate of the target) = 7
- q (y-coordinate of the target) = 7

The `Wave` class is instantiated with these values. The `attack` method is called to calculate the number of times the wave can reach the target.

The maximum distance the wave can travel is calculated as `v * t`, which is `1 * 10 = 10`. This value is squared to get `maxDist = 100`.

The `attack` method calculates the maximum width `maxW` that the wave can reach by incrementing `maxW` until the distance to the target exceeds `maxDist`. The loop stops when `maxW` is 1 because `getPowDistance(1, 0)` is greater than `maxDist`.

The method then calculates the number of reachable points in the positive w and h direction. It starts with `maxW - 1` and decrements `w` until the distance to the target exceeds `maxDist`. The same process is repeated for negative values of h.

The method also calculates the number of reachable points in the negative w direction, both for positive and negative h, by starting with `-maxW` and incrementing `w` until the distance to the target exceeds `maxDist`.

The `getPowDistance` method calculates the distance from the wave source to the target considering reflections off the walls. It uses the formula for the distance between two points, taking into account the number of reflections off each wall.

After all calculations, the `attack` method returns the total number of times the wave can reach the target, which is stored in the variable `ans`.

Let's calculate the value of `ans`:
- Initially, `ans = maxW = 1` because the loop for `maxW` stops when `maxW` is 1.
- For positive w and h, the loop runs until `w` is 0, adding the value of `w + 1` to `ans` each time the distance is within `maxDist`.
- For negative w and positive h, the loop runs until `w` is -1, subtracting the value of `w` from `ans` each time the distance is within `maxDist`.
- The same process is repeated for positive w and negative h, and for negative w and negative h.

The final value of `ans` is the output of the program.
