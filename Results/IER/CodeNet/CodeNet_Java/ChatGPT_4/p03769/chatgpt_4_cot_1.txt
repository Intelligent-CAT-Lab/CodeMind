The input is `7`. The `solve()` method is called, which calls `permutationWhoseNumberOfIncreasingSequenceIsK(n)` with `n = 7`.

Inside `permutationWhoseNumberOfIncreasingSequenceIsK(7)`, the following steps occur:
1. `cur` is assigned the value `Long.highestOneBit(K+1)-1`, which is `Long.highestOneBit(8)-1 = 7`.
2. A `List<Integer> list` is created and populated with integers from 0 to `Long.bitCount(cur)-1`. Since `cur` is 7 (binary 111), `Long.bitCount(cur)` is 3, so `list` is populated with [0, 1, 2].
3. `p` is assigned the value `Long.bitCount(cur)`, which is 3.
4. A for loop starts with `d` from `Long.bitCount(cur)-1` to 0, which is from 2 to 0.
5. Inside the loop, `x` is assigned `1L<<d`. For each `d`, it checks if `cur + x` is less than or equal to `K`. If it is, `cur` is updated to `cur + x`, and `p` is inserted at index `d` in `list`, and `p` is incremented.
   - For `d = 2`, `x = 4`, `cur + x = 11` which is greater than `K`, so nothing happens.
   - For `d = 1`, `x = 2`, `cur + x = 9` which is greater than `K`, so nothing happens.
   - For `d = 0`, `x = 1`, `cur + x = 8` which is equal to `K`, so `cur` becomes `8`, `p` (which is 3) is inserted at index `0` in `list`, and `p` becomes 4.

After the loop, `list` is [3, 0, 1, 2].

Back in `solve()`, the size of `list` is 4, so `out.println(perm.size()*2)` prints `8`.
Then it prints integers from 1 to `perm.size()` which is `1 2 3 4`.
Finally, it prints the elements of `list` incremented by 1, which is `4 1 2 3`.

The output is the concatenation of these two sequences, separated by spaces.
