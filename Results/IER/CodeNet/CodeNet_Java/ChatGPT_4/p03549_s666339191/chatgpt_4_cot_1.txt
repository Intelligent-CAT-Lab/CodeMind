<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and m from the input, which are 1 and 1 respectively. It then calculates the expression `(1900 * m + 100 * (n - m)) * (1<<m)`.

Breaking down the expression:
- `1900 * m` is `1900 * 1` which equals `1900`.
- `n - m` is `1 - 1` which equals `0`.
- `100 * (n - m)` is `100 * 0` which equals `0`.
- The sum of `1900 * m` and `100 * (n - m)` is `1900 + 0` which equals `1900`.
- `1<<m` is `1` shifted to the left by `1` bit, which is `2` in decimal.
- Finally, `1900 * 2` equals `3800`.

The code then prints the result of the expression, which is `3800`.
