<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, A, and B are initialized with 5, 2, and 4 respectively according to the input.

The code then checks if A is equal to B. If they are equal, it prints 0. Since A is not equal to B, it moves to the next condition.

The next condition checks if the difference between B and A is even by using the modulo operator. If the difference is even, it prints the half of the difference. Since (B - A) is 2, which is even, it should print (B - A) / 2.

Therefore, the output will be (4 - 2) / 2 which equals 1.
