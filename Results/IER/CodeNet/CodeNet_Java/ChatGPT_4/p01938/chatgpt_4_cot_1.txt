<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "AIZU" is read and converted to a character array `list` with the characters ['A', 'I', 'Z', 'U'].
The variable `a` is initialized with the character 'A', and the variable `sum` is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates over the character array `list`.

On the first iteration (i=0), `list[i]` is 'A', which is equal to `a`. Since 'A' is less than or equal to 'A', `sum` is incremented by 1. `a` is then set to 'A'.
On the second iteration (i=1), `list[i]` is 'I', which is greater than `a` ('A'). The condition is not met, so `sum` remains 1. `a` is then set to 'I'.
On the third iteration (i=2), `list[i]` is 'Z', which is greater than `a` ('I'). The condition is not met, so `sum` remains 1. `a` is then set to 'Z'.
On the fourth iteration (i=3), `list[i]` is 'U', which is less than `a` ('Z'). Since 'U' is less than 'Z', `sum` is incremented by 1. `a` is then set to 'U'.

After the loop finishes, the final value of `sum` is 2, which is printed as the output.
