<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with 46979 according to the input.
The variable h is calculated by dividing S by 3600, which is the number of seconds in an hour. 46979 / 3600 equals 13, so h is 13.
The variable hi is the remainder of S divided by 3600, which is 46979 % 3600 equals 79.
The variable m is calculated by dividing hi by 60, which is the number of seconds in a minute. 79 / 60 equals 1, so m is 1.
The variable s is the remainder of S divided by 60, which is 46979 % 60 equals 19.
The output is formatted as h:m:s, so it will print "13:1:19".
