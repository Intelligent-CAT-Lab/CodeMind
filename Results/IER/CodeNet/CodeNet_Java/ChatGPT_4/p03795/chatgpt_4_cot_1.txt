The variable n is initialized with 20 according to the input.
The code calculates the total cost by multiplying n by 800, which is the cost per item. So, 20 * 800 equals 16000.
Then, it calculates a discount by dividing n by 15 and multiplying the result by 200. Since 20 divided by 15 is 1 (integer division), the discount is 1 * 200 which equals 200.
Finally, it subtracts the discount from the total cost: 16000 - 200 equals 15800.
The result of this calculation, 15800, is printed as the output.
<<<Output>>>
15800
