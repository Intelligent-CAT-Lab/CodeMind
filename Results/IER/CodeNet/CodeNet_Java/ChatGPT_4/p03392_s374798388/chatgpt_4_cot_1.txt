<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is initialized with "abc".

The main method calls the solve() method and prints its result.

The solve() method first checks if the length of S is 1, which it is not. Then it checks if the length of S is less than or equal to 3, which it is. Since the length of S is 3, it calls the count() method.

The count() method creates a HashSet and an ArrayDeque to keep track of unique strings. It adds the original string S to both the set and the queue.

The while loop in the count() method processes the queue until it is empty. For each string s in the queue, it checks each pair of adjacent characters. If they are different, it replaces them with the third character that is not in the pair (using the not() method) and creates a new string t. If t is not already in the set, it is added to both the set and the queue.

For the input "abc", the while loop does not find any adjacent characters that are different, so no new strings are added to the set or the queue.

After the while loop, the count() method returns the size of the set, which contains only the original string "abc". Therefore, the size is 1.

The solve() method then returns this value, which is printed by the main method.
