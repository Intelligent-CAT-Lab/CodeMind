<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is `<>>`. The length of the string n is 3. The variables sum, ptr, cnt, and curr are initialized to 0.

The while loop starts with ptr = 0 and will iterate until ptr is less than n (3).

1. In the first iteration, ptr = 0, and str.charAt(ptr) is `<`, which does not match `>`, so the else block is executed. sum remains 0, curr is incremented to 1, and ptr is incremented to 1.

2. In the second iteration, ptr = 1, and str.charAt(ptr) is `>`, which matches `>`, so the while loop inside the if block is executed. ptr is incremented to 2, and cnt is incremented to 1. The loop continues as ptr is still less than n and str.charAt(ptr) is `>`. ptr is incremented to 3, and cnt is incremented to 2. Now ptr is equal to n, so the loop ends. Since curr (1) is not greater than cnt (2), the else block inside the if block is executed. sum is updated to sum + ((cnt + 1) * cnt) / 2, which is 0 + ((2 + 1) * 2) / 2 = 3. curr is reset to 0, and cnt is reset to 0.

3. The while loop condition is now false because ptr is not less than n, so the loop ends.

4. The last character of the string is checked. Since str.charAt(n-1) is `>`, the if condition is false, and nothing is added to sum.

The final value of sum is 3, which is printed as the output.
