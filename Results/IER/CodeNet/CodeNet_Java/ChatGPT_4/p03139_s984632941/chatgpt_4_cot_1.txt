<<<Analysis>>>
The main method initializes an InputStream and OutputStream for System.in and System.out, respectively. It then creates a LightScanner object 'in' for input and a LightWriter object 'out' for output. An ASubscribers object 'solver' is created and its solve method is called with parameters 1, 'in', and 'out'.

The solve method of ASubscribers class is called with testNumber set to 1, and the LightScanner 'in' and LightWriter 'out' objects. Inside the solve method, the Debug.autoEnable() method is called, but it does not affect the output since the DEBUG_PROPERTY is not set.

The variables n, x, and y are initialized with the values 10, 3, and 5 respectively according to the input. The method then calls out.ans(Math.min(x, y)) which calculates the minimum of x and y, which is 3, and writes it to the output. Then it calls out.ans(Math.max(x + y - n, 0)) which calculates the maximum of (x + y - n) and 0, which is (3 + 5 - 10) = -2, but since the maximum with 0 is calculated, it results in 0. The ln() method is called to add a line separator and flush the output.

Finally, the out.close() method is called to close the output stream.

The output will be the minimum of x and y, followed by a space, then the maximum of (x + y - n) and 0, followed by a line separator.
