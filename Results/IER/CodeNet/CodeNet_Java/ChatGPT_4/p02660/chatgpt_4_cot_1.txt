<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 24 according to the input.
The code checks if n is equal to 1, which it is not, so it proceeds to the next block.

A HashMap pMap is created to store the prime factors of n and their counts.

The code enters a for loop and iterates from 2 to the square root of n (which is less than 5 in this case). Inside the loop, it checks if the current number i is a factor of n by using the modulo operator. If it is, it increments the count and divides n by i.

For i = 2, n is divisible by 2, so count is incremented and n becomes 12. The loop continues and n is still divisible by 2, so count is incremented again and n becomes 6. The loop continues and n is still divisible by 2, so count is incremented again and n becomes 3. Now n is not divisible by 2 anymore, so the loop ends and 2 with count 3 is put into the map.

For i = 3, n is divisible by 3, so count is incremented and n becomes 1. Now n is not divisible by 3 anymore, so the loop ends and 3 with count 1 is put into the map.

For i = 4, the loop does not execute because n is now 1.

Since n is now 1, the if condition after the loop is not executed.

Now, the code iterates over the values of the map, which are the counts of the prime factors. For each count, it subtracts a series of increasing integers (1, 2, 3, ...) from the count until the count is less than the next integer in the series. Each time it subtracts, it increments the variable ans.

For the count of 2 (which is 3), it subtracts 1 (count becomes 2), then 2 (count becomes 0), so ans is incremented twice and becomes 2.

For the count of 3 (which is 1), it subtracts 1 (count becomes 0), so ans is incremented once and becomes 3.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 3.
