<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with an inner `Solution` class and an inner `InputReader` class. The `Main` class's `main` method initializes an `InputReader` to read from `System.in` and a `PrintWriter` to write to `System.out`.

The `solve` method of the `Solution` class reads two integers `a` and `b` using the `InputReader` and then calculates two values: the product of `a` and `b`, and the perimeter of a rectangle with sides `a` and `b`. The perimeter is calculated as `2*a + 2*b`. These two values are then printed on the same line separated by a space.

Given the input `3 5`, the `solve` method will read `a` as 3 and `b` as 5. It will then calculate the product as `3*5 = 15` and the perimeter as `2*3 + 2*5 = 6 + 10 = 16`. The output will be the product followed by the perimeter, separated by a space.
