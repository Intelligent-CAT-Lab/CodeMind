<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers from the input, which are 2 and 2, and assigns them to the variables N and M respectively. It then calculates the absolute value of the expression (N-2) * (M-2). For the given input, the calculation is as follows:

(N-2) * (M-2) = (2-2) * (2-2) = 0 * 0 = 0

Since the result is 0, the absolute value of 0 is also 0. Therefore, the code will output 0.
