The input is `2`, which is assigned to the variable `k`. The code checks if `k` is equal to `1`, and if so, it would print `1` twice and return. However, since `k` is `2`, it does not enter this condition.

The variable `n` is calculated as `2 * ((k+3)/4)`. Since `k` is `2`, the calculation is `2 * ((2+3)/4)`, which simplifies to `2 * (5/4)`. Since the division is integer division, `5/4` is `1`, so `n` becomes `2`.

The variable `curt` is calculated as `n*2 - k`, which is `2*2 - 2`, resulting in `2`.

A 2x2 matrix `mat` is created. The code then enters a nested loop to fill the matrix. The conditions inside the loop determine the value to be placed in each cell of the matrix.

For `r=0` and `c=0`, since `r%2` is not `1`, it goes to the else block. The value assigned to `mat[0][0]` is `(0+0)%2 + 1`, which is `1`.

For `r=0` and `c=1`, since `r%2` is not `1`, it goes to the else block. The value assigned to `mat[0][1]` is `(0+1)%2 + 1`, which is `2`.

For `r=1` and `c=0`, since `r%2` is `1`, it goes to the if block. The value assigned to `mat[1][0]` is `2 + (1+0)%2`, which is `3`.

For `r=1` and `c=1`, since `r%2` is `1`, it goes to the if block. The value assigned to `mat[1][1]` is `2 + (1+1)%2`, which is `2 + 0`, so `mat[1][1]` is `3`.

After filling the matrix, the code prints the value of `n`, which is `2`, and then prints the matrix in a formatted way.
