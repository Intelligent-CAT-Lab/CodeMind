<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable r.

The variable r is initialized with the value 1199 according to the input.

The code then uses a series of if-else statements to determine the value of the string s based on the value of r. The conditions are as follows:
- If r is less than 1200, s is set to "ABC".
- If r is greater than or equal to 1200 but less than 2800, s is set to "ARC".
- If r is greater than or equal to 2800, s is set to "AGC".

Since the input value for r is 1199, which is less than 1200, the first condition is met, and s is set to "ABC".

Finally, the code prints the value of s, which is "ABC".

<<<Output>>>
ABC
