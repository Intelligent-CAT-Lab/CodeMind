<<<Analysis>>>
The Scanner object `sc` is created to read input from the standard input stream. Two strings `a` and `b` are read from the input, which are "H" and "H" respectively according to the given input.
The program then checks if string `a` is equal to string `b` using the `equals` method. Since both strings are "H", the condition `a.equals(b)` evaluates to true.
Because the condition is true, the program prints "H" to the standard output.
<<<Output>>>
H
