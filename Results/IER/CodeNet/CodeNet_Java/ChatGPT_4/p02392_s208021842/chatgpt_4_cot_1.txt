<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with the `main` method and another class `Main2` with a method `yesNo`. The `main` method creates an instance of `Main2` and calls the `yesNo` method on it.

The `yesNo` method initializes a `Scanner` object to read input from the standard input stream. It then declares an integer array `abc` of size 3. It enters a for loop that iterates three times to read three integers from the input and stores them in the `abc` array.

The input provided is `1 3 8`. The for loop reads these integers and stores them in `abc` such that `abc[0] = 1`, `abc[1] = 3`, and `abc[2] = 8`.

After the loop, there is an if-else statement that checks if `abc[0] < abc[1]` and `abc[1] < abc[2]`. Since `1 < 3` and `3 < 8` are both true, the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the program prints "Yes" to the standard output.
