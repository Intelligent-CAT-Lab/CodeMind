<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input, n and k, which are 11 and 2 respectively. It then converts the integer n (11) to its representation in base k (2), which is binary in this case. The number 11 in binary is 1011, which has a length of 4 characters. The code then prints the length of this binary representation, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
