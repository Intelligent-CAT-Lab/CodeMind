<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "aatt" is converted to a character array A with length N = 4. The array cnt with size 26 is used to count the occurrences of each letter in the string, where each index corresponds to a letter ('a' to 'z').

The for loop iterates over the character array A and increments the count for each character in the cnt array. The counts for 'a' and 't' will be incremented twice since they each appear twice in the string "aatt".

After the loop, the variable ans is initialized with the formula (long)N*(N+1)/2+1, which calculates the total number of substrings that can be formed from the string, including an empty substring, hence the +1. For the input "aatt", this results in ans = (4*(4+1)/2)+1 = (4*5/2)+1 = (20/2)+1 = 10+1 = 11.

Next, the for loop iterates over the cnt array to subtract the number of repeated substrings for each character that appears more than once. The formula used is (long)cnt[i]*(cnt[i]+1)/2 for each character count cnt[i] that is greater than 0.

For 'a', cnt[0] is 2, so the number of repeated substrings is (2*(2+1)/2) = (2*3/2) = 3.
For 't', cnt[19] is 2, so the number of repeated substrings is also 3.

The variable ans is updated by subtracting these values: ans = 11 - 3 - 3 = 5.

Finally, the program prints the value of ans, which is the total number of distinct substrings that can be formed from the input string "aatt".
