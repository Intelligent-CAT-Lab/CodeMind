<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "Thank you for your mail and your lectures". This string is split into an array of words ["Thank", "you", "for", "your", "mail", "and", "your", "lectures"].

Two HashMaps are created: `count` to store the frequency of each word, and `length` to store the length of each word.

The for loop iterates over the array of words. For each word, it checks if the word is already in the `count` HashMap. If it is not, it adds the word with a count of 1 and also adds the word to the `length` HashMap with its length. If the word is already in the `count` HashMap, it increments the count for that word.

After processing all words, the program iterates over the `count` HashMap to find the word with the maximum frequency. It also iterates over the `length` HashMap to find the word with the maximum length.

The word with the maximum frequency is "your" with a frequency of 2.
The word with the maximum length is "lectures" with a length of 8.

Finally, the program prints the word with the maximum frequency and the word with the maximum length separated by a space.

<<<Output>>>
your lectures
