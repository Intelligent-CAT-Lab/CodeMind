<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, n and k, from the input. For the given input, n is assigned the value 3 and k is assigned the value 2.

The code then evaluates the expression `(n >= k * 2 - 1)` which translates to `(3 >= 2 * 2 - 1)`, which simplifies to `(3 >= 4 - 1)`, and further to `(3 >= 3)`. Since 3 is equal to 3, the condition is true.

Because the condition is true, the ternary operator returns the string "YES", which is then printed to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
YES
