<<<Analysis>>>
The input "4 3 2" is read as a single string and assigned to the variable `nyu`. The code then replaces all spaces in the string with an empty string, effectively concatenating all the numbers together to form "432". The resulting string is then parsed into an integer.

The code checks if the integer value of the concatenated string (432) is divisible by 4. Since 432 is indeed divisible by 4 (as 432 / 4 = 108), the condition of the if statement is true.

Therefore, the program will print "YES" as the output.

<<<Output>>>
YES
