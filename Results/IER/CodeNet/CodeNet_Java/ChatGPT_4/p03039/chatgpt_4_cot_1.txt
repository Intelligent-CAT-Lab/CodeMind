<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 2 2` initializes the variables n, m, and k with the values 2, 2, and 2 respectively.

The `enumFIF` function is called with parameters 1000000 and 1000000007 (mod). This function creates an array of factorials and their modular inverses up to 1000000. The factorial of a number is calculated iteratively and the modular inverse is calculated using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

The `C` function is a helper function that calculates the combination C(n, r) modulo mod using the precomputed factorial and inverse factorial arrays.

The main part of the solve method calculates two sums, xsum and ysum, which represent the sum of distances in the x and y directions respectively.

For xsum:
- xa is calculated as the combination C(n*m-2, k-2) times the factorial of k-2 modulo mod.
- xb is calculated in a loop from 0 to m-1, where each term is the product of i, (m-i), n, n, and 2, all modulo mod. The sum of these terms is stored in xb.
- xc is the product of xa, xb, and C(k, 2) modulo mod.
- xsum is the product of xc and the inverse factorial of k modulo mod.

For ysum:
- ya is calculated similarly to xa.
- yb is calculated in a loop from 0 to n-1, similar to xb but with n and m swapped.
- yc is the product of ya, yb, and C(k, 2) modulo mod.
- ysum is the product of yc and the inverse factorial of k modulo mod.

Finally, the sum of xsum and ysum modulo mod is printed as the output.

Given the input `2 2 2`, the calculations will be as follows:
- xa and ya will be C(2, 0) which is 1.
- xb will be the sum of the products of i, (2-i), 2, 2, and 2 for i from 0 to 1. This is (0*2*2*2*2 + 1*1*2*2*2) % mod = 8 % mod.
- yb will be the same as xb since n and m are both 2.
- xc and yc will be xa * xb * C(2, 2) % mod = 1 * 8 * 1 % mod = 8 % mod.
- xsum and ysum will be xc * 1 % mod = 8 % mod.

Therefore, the final output will be (xsum + ysum) % mod = (8 + 8) % mod = 16 % mod = 16.
