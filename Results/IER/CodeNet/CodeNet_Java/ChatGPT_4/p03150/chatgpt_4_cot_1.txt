<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "keyofscience" is passed to the `check` method. The method first checks if the input string is exactly "keyence". Since it is not, the method proceeds to the nested for loops.

The outer loop iterates over the indices of the string, with `i` ranging from 0 to the length of the string. The inner loop iterates with `j` starting from `i+1` to the length of the string inclusive.

In each iteration, the method creates a new string `str` by concatenating two substrings of the original string `s`: one from the beginning to the index `i` (exclusive), and the other from the index `j` (inclusive) to the end of the string.

The method then checks if `str` equals "keyence". If it does, the method returns `true`, and the main method prints "YES". If none of the created substrings match "keyence", the method returns `false`, and the main method prints "NO".

Let's go through the iterations:
- For `i = 0` and `j = 1` to `s.length()`, none of the substrings will match "keyence".
- For `i = 1` and `j = 2` to `s.length()`, none of the substrings will match "keyence".
- ...
- For `i = 3` and `j = 4` to `s.length()`, when `j = 11`, the substring will be "keyence" because it takes "key" from the start and "ence" from the end, skipping "ofsci" in the middle.
- Since we found a match, the method will return `true`.

Therefore, the output will be "YES".
