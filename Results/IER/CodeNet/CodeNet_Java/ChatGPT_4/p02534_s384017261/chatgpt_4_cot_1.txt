<<<Analysis>>>
The input `3` is read and assigned to the variable `n` in the `solve` method. The `solve` method contains a loop that iterates `n` times, which in this case is 3 times.

Inside the loop, the method `format` is called with the argument `"ACL"`. The `format` method in the `InOut` class appends the given string to the `PrintWriter` object `pw` without adding a newline.

Since the loop iterates 3 times, the string `"ACL"` will be appended to the output 3 times without any spaces or newlines between them.

After the loop, there is a conditional check `if (cs < tt)` which is checking if the current case number `cs` is less than the total number of test cases `tt`. Since `tt` is initialized to 1 and never changed, and `cs` is initialized to 1 and incremented in each iteration, this condition will never be true, so the `format("\n")` inside this conditional block will never be executed.

Therefore, the output will be the string `"ACL"` repeated 3 times, concatenated together.
