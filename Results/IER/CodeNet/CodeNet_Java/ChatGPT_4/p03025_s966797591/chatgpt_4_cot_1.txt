<<<Analysis>>>
The input values are N=1, A=25, B=25, and C=50. The code is designed to calculate a probability-related sum based on these values.

1. The variables pA and pB are calculated as follows:
   pA = A * inv(A + B) % MOD = 25 * inv(50) % MOD
   pB = B * inv(A + B) % MOD = 25 * inv(50) % MOD
   Since inv(50) is the modular inverse of 50 under MOD, which is pow(50, -1), we calculate it as pow(50, MOD-2) due to Fermat's little theorem.

2. The arrays powA and powB are filled with the powers of pA and pB respectively, up to N+1 terms.

3. The array combN is filled with the values of comb(N + i - 1, i) for i from 0 to N, using the previously calculated values and the inv function to calculate the modular inverse.

4. The for loop iterates from i=0 to N-1 (which is 0 in this case since N=1), and calculates the sum as follows:
   sum += (N + i) * (a + b) % MOD * combN[i] % MOD
   where a = powA[N] * powB[i] % MOD and b = powA[i] * powB[N] % MOD.

5. Since N=1, the loop will run only once with i=0. The values of a and b will be:
   a = powA[1] * powB[0] % MOD = pA * 1 % MOD
   b = powA[0] * powB[1] % MOD = 1 * pB % MOD

6. The sum is then multiplied by 100 and the modular inverse of (A + B) to account for the last part of the probability calculation.

7. Finally, the sum is printed out as the result.

Let's calculate the values step by step:
   inv(50) = pow(50, MOD-2) = pow(50, 1000000005) % MOD
   Since the exponent is large, we use the pow function to calculate it efficiently.

   pA = 25 * inv(50) % MOD
   pB = 25 * inv(50) % MOD
   Since A and B are equal, pA and pB will be the same.

   powA[1] = pA
   powB[0] = 1
   powB[1] = pB

   combN[0] = comb(0, 0) = 1
   combN[1] = combN[0] * (1+0) % MOD * inv(1) % MOD = 1

   a = powA[1] * powB[0] % MOD = pA * 1 % MOD = pA
   b = powA[0] * powB[1] % MOD = 1 * pB % MOD = pB

   sum = (1 + 0) * (a + b) % MOD * combN[0] % MOD
       = 1 * (pA + pB) % MOD * 1 % MOD
       = (pA + pB) % MOD

   sum *= 100
   sum %= MOD
   sum *= inv(50)
   sum %= MOD

Since pA and pB are the same, (pA + pB) % MOD is simply 2 * pA % MOD. We need to calculate pA and then proceed with the final steps to get the sum.

Let's calculate pA:
   inv(50) = pow(50, 1000000005) % MOD
   This calculation is complex, but we know that 50 * inv(50) % MOD = 1 due to the definition of the modular inverse. Therefore, we can say that inv(50) is some value x such that 50x % MOD = 1.

   pA = 25 * x % MOD

Now, we can calculate the sum:
   sum = (2 * 25 * x) % MOD
   sum *= 100
   sum %= MOD
   sum *= x
   sum %= MOD

Since we don't have the exact value of x, we cannot calculate the exact numerical value of sum. However, the code is designed to perform these calculations modulo MOD, and the final result is the value of sum after all these operations.

<<<Output>>>
The output cannot be determined without performing the actual calculations, which involve large exponentiation and modular arithmetic
