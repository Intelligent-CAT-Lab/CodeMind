<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads five integers from the input, which are assigned to H1, M1, H2, M2, and K respectively. According to the input, H1 is 10, M1 is 0, H2 is 15, M2 is 0, and K is 30.

The code then calculates the start time in minutes by multiplying H1 by 60 and adding M1, which results in 10*60 + 0 = 600 minutes.

Similarly, it calculates the end time in minutes by multiplying H2 by 60 and adding M2, which results in 15*60 + 0 = 900 minutes.

The code then calculates the difference between the end time and the start time and subtracts K from this difference. The difference between end and start is 900 - 600 = 300 minutes.

Finally, it subtracts K (which is 30) from this difference, resulting in 300 - 30 = 270 minutes.

The code prints this final result, which is 270.
