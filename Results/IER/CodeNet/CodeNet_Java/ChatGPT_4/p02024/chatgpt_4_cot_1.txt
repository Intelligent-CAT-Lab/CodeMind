<<<Analysis>>>
The variables h, w, s, and t are initialized with 4, 5, 2, and 3 respectively according to the input. The code then checks two conditions:
1. If the product of h and w is odd (h * w % 2 == 1)
2. If the expression (s * w + t) is odd ((s * w + t) % 2 == 1)

For the given input:
- h * w = 4 * 5 = 20, which is even, so the first condition (h * w % 2 == 1) is false.
- s * w + t = 2 * 5 + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13, which is odd, so the second condition ((s * w + t) % 2 == 1) is true.

Since the first condition is false, the if statement does not execute, and the else block is executed, printing "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
