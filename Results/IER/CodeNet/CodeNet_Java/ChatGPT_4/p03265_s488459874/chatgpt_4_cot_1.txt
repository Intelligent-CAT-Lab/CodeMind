<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided initializes the variables x1, y1, x2, and y2 with 0, 0, 0, and 1 respectively. The code is designed to calculate the coordinates of the third and fourth vertices (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) of a square given the coordinates of two opposite vertices (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

First, it calculates the vector from the first point to the second point (v1x, v1y) which is (0 - 0, 1 - 0) = (0, 1).

Then, it calculates the coordinates of the fourth vertex (x4, y4) by rotating the vector 90 degrees counterclockwise and adding it to the first point. The rotation is achieved by swapping the vector components and negating the new x-component to get a 90-degree rotation. So, (-v1y + x1, v1x + y1) becomes (-1 + 0, 0 + 0) = (-1, 0).

Next, it calculates the vector from the fourth point to the first point (v2x, v2y) which is (0 - (-1), 0 - 0) = (1, 0).

Finally, it calculates the coordinates of the third vertex (x3, y3) by rotating the vector 90 degrees counterclockwise and adding it to the fourth point. So, (-v2y + x4, v2x + y4) becomes (-0 + (-1), 1 + 0) = (-1, 1).

The output is the coordinates of the third and fourth vertices of the square, which are (-1, 1) and (-1, 0) respectively.
