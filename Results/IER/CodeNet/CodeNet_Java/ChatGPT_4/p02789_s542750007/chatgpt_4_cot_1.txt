<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a nested static class `Solver` that contains methods for input parsing and utility functions. The `Main` class's `main` method initializes a `Solver` instance and calls its `solve` method.

The `solve` method calls `ni()` twice, which reads two integers from the standard input. The `reply` method is then called with the condition `ni() == ni()`. Since `ni()` reads the next integer from the input, it will compare the two integers read from the input.

Given the input `3 3`, the `solve` method will compare the two integers and since they are equal, the `reply` method will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
