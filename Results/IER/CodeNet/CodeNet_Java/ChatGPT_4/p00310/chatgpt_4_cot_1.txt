<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads three integers from the input, separated by spaces, and assigns them to the variables p, m, and c, respectively. The input provided is "10 10 20", so p is assigned the value 10, m is assigned the value 10, and c is assigned the value 20. The code then prints the sum of these three integers, which is p + m + c, or 10 + 10 + 20, which equals 40.
<<<Output>>>
40
