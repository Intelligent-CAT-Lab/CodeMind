<<<Analysis>>>
The input is read as a string and then parsed into an integer n with the value of 3. The main method then calls the problem102a method with n as the argument.
Inside the problem102a method, it checks if n is even by using the modulo operator (n % 2 == 0). If n is even, it returns n; otherwise, it returns n multiplied by 2.
Since n is 3, which is not even, the condition (n % 2 == 0) evaluates to false. Therefore, the method returns n * 2, which is 3 * 2 = 6.
The main method then prints the result, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
