<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then creates a HashSet to store integers.

The for loop runs three times, each time reading an integer from the input and adding it to the HashSet. The input provided is `5 7 5`.

During the first iteration, the number 5 is read and added to the set.
During the second iteration, the number 7 is read and added to the set.
During the third iteration, the number 5 is read again. However, since sets do not allow duplicate elements, the size of the set remains 2.

After the loop, the code checks if the size of the set is exactly 2. Since the set contains the numbers 5 and 7, its size is indeed 2.

The ternary operator (`set.size() == 2 ? "Yes" : "No"`) evaluates to "Yes" because the size of the set is 2.

Finally, the program prints "Yes" to the standard output.
