<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "abc" is read and stored in the variable s. The length of the string "abc" is 3, which is not equal to 2, so the program does not print the string as it is. Instead, it enters the else block.
Inside the else block, a new StringBuffer object is created with the content of the string s, and the reverse method is called on this StringBuffer object to reverse the string. The reversed string is then converted back to a String object and stored in the variable dst.
The reversed string "cba" is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
cba
