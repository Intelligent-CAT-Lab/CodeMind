<<<Analysis>>>
The input "3 2" initializes the variables N and K with the values 3 and 2 respectively. The ModUtility class is then instantiated with a new Prime object with the value 1_000_000_007, which is a large prime number used as the modulus for all the modular arithmetic operations.

An array of ModInteger objects, gcd, is created with a size of K+1 (3 in this case). The loop starts at i=1 and goes up to K (2), and for each iteration, it calculates K/i (2/1, 2/2) raised to the power of N (3), using the pow method of ModUtility. The results are stored in the gcd array.

After the loop, another loop starts from K (2) and goes down to 1. For each i, it subtracts from gcd[i] the values of all gcd[j] where j is a multiple of i and greater than i (none in this case, since K is 2). This is done to ensure that gcd[i] only counts the sets where the greatest common divisor is exactly i.

Finally, the answer is calculated by summing up all the values of gcd[i] multiplied by i. In this case, it will be gcd[1]*1 + gcd[2]*2.

The final answer is then printed out, which is the sum of all the gcd[i]*i.
