<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "password" is read and stored in the variable input.

The boolean variable flag is set based on the following conditions:
1. The length of the input string must be at least 6 characters.
2. The input string must contain at least one lowercase letter (checked by the regex ".*[a-z]+.*").
3. The input string must contain at least one uppercase letter (checked by the regex ".*[A-Z]+.*").
4. The input string must contain at least one digit (checked by the regex ".*[0-9]+.*").

The input "password" satisfies the first condition as its length is 8 characters.

However, it does not satisfy the second condition because it does not contain any uppercase letters. The regex ".*[A-Z]+.*" requires at least one uppercase letter to be present in the string, which is not the case here.

Since the input does not satisfy all the conditions, the flag will be set to false.

The ternary operator checks the value of flag and since it is false, "INVALID" will be printed.
