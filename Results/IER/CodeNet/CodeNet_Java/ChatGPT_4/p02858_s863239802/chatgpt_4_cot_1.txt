The input provided is `2 2 1`. The variables `h`, `w`, and `t` are initialized with these values respectively.

The `solve` method is called with these values. Inside the `solve` method, the following steps occur:

1. `hg` is assigned the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `h` and `t`, which is GCD(2, 1) = 1.
2. `wg` is assigned the GCD of `w` and `t`, which is GCD(2, 1) = 1.
3. The method `mod.pow` is called three times with the following parameters:
   - `mod.pow(2, w / wg)` which is `mod.pow(2, 2 / 1)` = `mod.pow(2, 2)` = 4 modulo `1e9 + 7`.
   - `mod.pow(2, h / hg)` which is `mod.pow(2, 2 / 1)` = `mod.pow(2, 2)` = 4 modulo `1e9 + 7`.
   - `mod.pow(2, IntMath.gcd(h / hg, w / wg))` which is `mod.pow(2, GCD(2 / 1, 2 / 1))` = `mod.pow(2, GCD(2, 2))` = `mod.pow(2, 2)` = 4 modulo `1e9 + 7`.
4. The sum of these three results is `4 + 4 + 4 = 12`, and then `MOD - 3` is subtracted, resulting in `12 + (1e9 + 7) - 3 = 1e9 + 16`.
5. The final result is `mod.pow(1e9 + 16, (wg * hg) % (MOD - 1))` which is `mod.pow(1e9 + 16, (1 * 1) % (1e9 + 6))` = `mod.pow(1e9 + 16, 1)` = `1e9 + 16` modulo `1e9 + 7`.
6. Since `1e9 + 16` is greater than `1e9 + 7`, we take the modulo, which results in `1e9 + 16 - (1e9 + 7) = 9`.

Therefore, the final output of the code execution is `9`.
