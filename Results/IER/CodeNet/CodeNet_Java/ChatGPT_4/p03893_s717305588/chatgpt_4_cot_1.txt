<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `2`, which is assigned to the variable `n`. The `main` method calls the `f` method with the argument `2`.

The `f` method is a recursive method. Here's the breakdown of the recursive calls:
1. `f(2)` calls `f(1)`, and waits for it to return a value.
2. `f(1)` calls `f(0)`, and waits for it to return a value.
3. `f(0)` is the base case, which returns `2`.

Now, the recursion starts to unwind:
1. `f(1)` receives `2` from `f(0)`, computes `(2 * 2) + 2`, which equals `6`, and returns this value.
2. `f(2)` receives `6` from `f(1)`, computes `(6 * 2) + 2`, which equals `14`, and returns this value.

The `main` method receives `14` from `f(2)` and prints it out as the final result.

14
