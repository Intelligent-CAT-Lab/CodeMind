<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main class `Main` with a `main` method that uses a custom scanner class `MScanner` to read input from the standard input stream. The `MScanner` class is a helper class that wraps around `BufferedReader` and `StringTokenizer` to facilitate input parsing.

The input provided is `10 4`, which means `h` is initialized with 10 and `a` is initialized with 4. The variable `ans` is initialized with 0.

The code enters a while loop that continues to execute as long as `h` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, `h` is decremented by `a` (which is 4), and `ans` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs.

The loop runs as follows:
1. First iteration: `h` is 10, `h` becomes `10 - 4 = 6`, `ans` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.
2. Second iteration: `h` is 6, `h` becomes `6 - 4 = 2`, `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
3. Third iteration: `h` is 2, `h` becomes `2 - 4 = -2`, `ans` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.

The loop stops because `h` is now less than 0. The final value of `ans` is 3.

The `PrintWriter` object `pw` is used to print the value of `ans` to the standard output, and then `pw.flush()` ensures that all output is actually written out.

Therefore, the output of the code execution will be `3`.
