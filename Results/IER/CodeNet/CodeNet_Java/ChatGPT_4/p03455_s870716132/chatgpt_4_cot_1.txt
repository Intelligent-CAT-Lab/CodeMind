<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input, which are 3 and 4, and assigns them to variables a and b, respectively. It then checks if the product of a and b is even by using the modulo operator (%). The product of a and b is 3 * 4 = 12. Since 12 % 2 equals 0, the condition (a * b % 2 == 0) is true, which means the product is even. Therefore, the code will print "Even".
<<<Output>>>
Even
