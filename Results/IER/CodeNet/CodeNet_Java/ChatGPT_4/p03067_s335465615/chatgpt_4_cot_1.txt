<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers a, b, and c from the input, which are 3, 8, and 5 respectively. It initializes a boolean variable ans with false.

The code then checks if a is less than or equal to b, which is true in this case (3 <= 8). Inside this if block, it checks if c is between a and b (inclusive). Since c is 5, and 5 is between 3 and 8, the condition (a <= c && c <= b) is true.

Therefore, ans is set to true.

Finally, the code prints "Yes" if ans is true, otherwise it prints "No". Since ans is true, the output will be "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
