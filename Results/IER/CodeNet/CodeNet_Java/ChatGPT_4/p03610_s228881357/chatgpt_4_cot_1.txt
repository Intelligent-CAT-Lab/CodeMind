<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "atcoder" is read and stored in variable s. A new StringBuilder object called ans is created to store the result.
The for loop iterates with the condition 2*i < s.length(), which means it will iterate for every second character in the string s, starting from the first character (index 0).
The loop will run as follows:
- i = 0, 2*i = 0, s.charAt(0) = 'a', ans = "a"
- i = 1, 2*i = 2, s.charAt(2) = 'c', ans = "ac"
- i = 2, 2*i = 4, s.charAt(4) = 'd', ans = "acd"
- i = 3, 2*i = 6, s.charAt(6) = 'r', ans = "acdr"
The loop stops here because the next value of i would be 4, and 2*i would be 8, which is not less than s.length() (7).
Finally, the StringBuilder object ans is converted to a String and printed, which is "acdr".
