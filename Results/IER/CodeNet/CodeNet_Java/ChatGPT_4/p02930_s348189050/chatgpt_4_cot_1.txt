The input is `3`, which is assigned to the variable `n`. The code then initializes a 2D array `e` with dimensions `n x n` (3x3 in this case) and an array `l` with size `n + 1` (4 in this case).

The array `l` is filled with values that represent the level of each index. The level is calculated based on the binary representation of the index, specifically by adding 1 to the level of the index divided by 2 (and rounded up). The levels are calculated as follows:
- l[2] = 1 + l[1] = 1
- l[3] = 1 + l[2] = 2

The `addEdges` function is called with parameters `e`, `l`, `0`, and `n`. This function is recursive and is used to fill the 2D array `e` with the level values. The base case for the recursion is when `size` is 1, in which case the function returns without doing anything.

For the input `3`, the `addEdges` function will perform the following steps:
1. Call `addEdges(e, l, 0, 3)`.
2. Since `size` is not 1, it calculates `level = l[3] = 2`, `x = 3 >> 1 = 1`, and `y = 3 - x = 2`.
3. It calls `addEdges(e, l, 0, 1)` which returns immediately since `size` is 1.
4. It calls `addEdges(e, l, 1, 2)`.
   - Inside this call, it calculates `level = l[2] = 1`, `x = 2 >> 1 = 1`, and `y = 2 - x = 1`.
   - It calls `addEdges(e, l, 1, 1)` which returns immediately since `size` is 1.
   - It calls `addEdges(e, l, 2, 1)` which returns immediately since `size` is 1.
   - It sets `e[1][2] = 1`.
5. It sets `e[0][1] = 2` and `e[0][2] = 2`.

After the `addEdges` function completes, the 2D array `e` will look like this:
```
[0, 2, 2]
[0, 0, 1]
[0, 0, 0]
```

The code then iterates over the upper triangle of the 2D array `e` (excluding the diagonal) and appends the values to the `StringBuilder out`, separated by spaces, and with a newline character after each row.

The expected output will be the upper triangle of the 2D array `e` printed row by row:
```
2 2 
1 
```
