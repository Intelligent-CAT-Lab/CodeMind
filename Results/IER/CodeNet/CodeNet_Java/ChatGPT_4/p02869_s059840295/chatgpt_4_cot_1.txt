<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `1 1`, which means n = 1 and k = 1.

The code first checks if n is less than k * 2 - 1. Since n = 1 and k = 1, the condition n < k * 2 - 1 translates to 1 < 1 * 2 - 1, which simplifies to 1 < 1. This condition is false, so the code does not print -1 and continues execution.

Next, the code initializes a 2D array `ret` with dimensions n x 3, which in this case is a 1 x 3 array since n = 1.

The code then enters a loop to fill the third column of the `ret` array with values k + 2 * n + i for each row i. Since n = 1, the loop will run only once, and the value assigned to ret[0][2] will be 1 + 2 * 1 + 0 = 3.

The next two loops are meant to fill the second column of the `ret` array with values k + n + i, alternating between odd and even values of i. However, since n = 1, each loop will run only once. The first loop will not run because it starts at i = 1 and increments by 2, but the second loop will run for i = 0. Therefore, ret[0][1] will be assigned the value 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.

A TreeSet `set` is then initialized and filled with values k + i for i from 0 to n - 1. Since n = 1, the set will contain only one value: 1 + 0 = 1.

The next loop is meant to fill the first column of the `ret` array. It calculates the difference between the third and second columns for each row, and then finds the largest number in the set that is less than or equal to this difference. Since there is only one row and the set contains only one number, the difference x is 3 - 2 = 1, and the largest number in the set less than or equal to 1 is 1. Therefore, ret[0][0] is set to 1, and the value 1 is removed from the set.

Finally, the code prints the contents of the `ret` array. Since the array has only one row, it will print that row, which contains the values 1, 2, and 3.
