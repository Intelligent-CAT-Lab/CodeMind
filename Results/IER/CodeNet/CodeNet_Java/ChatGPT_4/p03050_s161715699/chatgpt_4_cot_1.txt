The input is `8`, which is assigned to the variable `n`. The `divisors` method is called with `n` as the argument to find all divisors of `n`.

The `divisors` method iterates from `1` to just before the square root of `n` (since `i * i < n`). For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n` (`n % i == 0`). If it is, `i` is added to the list of divisors. Additionally, if `i` is not `1` and `i * i` is not equal to `n`, the corresponding divisor `n / i` is also added to the list.

For `n = 8`, the divisors found will be:
- `i = 1`: `8 % 1 == 0`, so `1` is added to the list.
- `i = 2`: `8 % 2 == 0`, so `2` is added to the list, and `8 / 2 = 4` is also added to the list.

The list of divisors is now `[1, 2, 4]`.

The main method then initializes `ans` to `0` and iterates over each divisor in the list. For each divisor `div`, it checks if `div` is greater than `1000000`, which it is not in this case, so it continues to the next condition.

The next condition checks if `n` is greater than `div * div + div`. If it is, it adds `(n - div) / div` to `ans`.

For each divisor:
- `div = 1`: `8` is greater than `1 * 1 + 1`, so `ans` is increased by `(8 - 1) / 1 = 7`.
- `div = 2`: `8` is greater than `2 * 2 + 2`, so `ans` is increased by `(8 - 2) / 2 = 3`.
- `div = 4`: `8` is not greater than `4 * 4 + 4`, so nothing is added to `ans`.

The final value of `ans` is `7 + 3 = 10`.
