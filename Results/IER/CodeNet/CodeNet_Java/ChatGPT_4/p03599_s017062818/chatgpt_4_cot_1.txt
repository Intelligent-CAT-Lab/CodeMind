The variables A, B, C, D, E, and F are initialized with 1, 2, 10, 20, 15, and 200 respectively according to the input. The variables ans, water, and sugar are initialized with -1, 0, and 0 respectively.

The code consists of four nested loops that iterate over all possible combinations of water and sugar to find the solution with the highest concentration of sugar that does not exceed the solubility limit.

The outermost loop iterates over the variable 'a', which represents the number of 100ml units of water from source A. It can go from 0 to F/(A*100), which is 200/(1*100) = 2 in this case.

The second loop iterates over the variable 'b', which represents the number of 100ml units of water from source B. It can go from 0 to (F-100*A*a)/(100*B), which depends on the current value of 'a'.

The third loop iterates over the variable 'c', which represents the number of units of sugar from source C. It can go from 0 to (F - 100*A*a - 100*B*b)/C, which depends on the current values of 'a' and 'b'.

The fourth loop iterates over the variable 'd', which represents the number of units of sugar from source D. It can go from 0 to (F - 100*A*a - 100*B*b - C*c)/D, which depends on the current values of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

Inside the innermost loop, the code checks if the current combination of water and sugar exceeds the solubility limit (C*c+D*d > (A*a+B*b)*E) or if there is no water (a+b==0). If either condition is true, it continues to the next iteration.

If the conditions are not met, the code calculates the concentration of sugar (buf) for the current combination. If this concentration is higher than the current highest concentration (ans), it updates ans, water, and sugar with the current values.

After all loops finish, the code prints the total weight of the solution (water+sugar) and the weight of the sugar (sugar).

Let's calculate the possible combinations and find the one with the highest concentration of sugar:

- For a=0, b=0, the condition a+b==0 is true, so we continue to the next iteration.
- For a=0, b=1, c=0, d=0, the total weight is 200g (200g water, 0g sugar), but the concentration is 0, so we continue.
- For a=0, b=1, c=0, d=1, the total weight is 220g (200g water, 20g sugar), and the concentration is 20/220.
- For a=0, b=1, c=0, d=2, the total weight is 240g (200g water, 40g sugar), and the concentration is 40/240, but this exceeds the solubility limit (40 > 200*15/100), so we continue.
- For a=0, b=1, c=1, d=0, the total weight is 210g (200g water, 10g sugar), and the concentration is 10/210.
- For a=0, b=1, c=1, d=1, the total weight is 230g (200g water, 30g sugar), and the concentration is 30/230, but this exceeds the solubility limit (30 > 200*15/100), so we continue.
- For a=1, b=0, c=0, d=0, the total weight is 100g (100g water, 0g sugar), but the concentration is 0, so we continue.
- For a=1, b=0, c=0, d=1, the total weight is 120g (100g water, 20g sugar), and the concentration is 20/120.
- For a=1, b=0, c=0, d=2, the total weight is 140g (100g water, 40g sugar), and the concentration is 40/140, but this exceeds the solubility limit (40 > 100*15/100), so we continue.
- For a=1, b=0, c=1, d=0, the total weight is 110g (100g water, 10g sugar), and the concentration is 10/110.
- For a=1, b=0, c=1
