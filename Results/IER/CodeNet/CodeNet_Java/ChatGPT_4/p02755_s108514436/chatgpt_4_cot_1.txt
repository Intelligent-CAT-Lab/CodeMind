<<<Analysis>>>
The input "2 2" initializes the variables A and B with the value 2 each. The main method calls the solve method with these values.

The solve method initializes two variables, low and high, with 1 and Integer.MAX_VALUE respectively. It also initializes ans with -1.

The method enters a while loop that continues as long as low is less than or equal to high. Inside the loop, it calculates the mid value between low and high.

It then calculates the consumption rate at 8% (p8) and 10% (p10) for the mid value using the consumptionRate method. The consumptionRate method simply calculates the floor value of the product of p and percent divided by 100.0.

The if condition checks if both p8 and p10 are equal to A and B respectively. If they are, it means the mid value is a potential answer, so it sets ans to mid and updates high to mid - 1 to continue searching for a lower possible value.

If p8 and p10 are not equal to A and B, but are less than or equal to A and B, it means the mid value is too low, so it updates low to mid + 1 to search for a higher value.

If p8 and p10 are greater than A and B, it means the mid value is too high, so it updates high to mid - 1 to search for a lower value.

The loop continues until low is greater than high. At this point, the method returns the value of ans.

For the input "2 2", the loop will find that when mid is 25, p8 is 2 (25 * 8 / 100 = 2) and p10 is 2 (25 * 10 / 100 = 2.5, floored to 2), which matches A and B. Therefore, ans is set to 25, and high is updated to 24.

The loop will continue to check if there is a smaller value that satisfies the condition, but since 25 is the smallest integer that gives both p8 and p10 as 2, the loop will eventually end with ans still being 25.

Thus, the output will be 25.
