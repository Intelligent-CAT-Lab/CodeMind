The variables a and b are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.

The variable tax8pricemin is calculated as the smallest integer that is not less than the result of a / 0.08, which is 2 / 0.08 = 25. So tax8pricemin is 25.

The variable tax8pricemax is calculated as the smallest integer that is not less than the result of (a + 1) / 0.08, which is (2 + 1) / 0.08 = 37.5. So tax8pricemax is 37.

The for loop iterates from tax8pricemin (25) to tax8pricemax (37), but not including tax8pricemax.

Inside the loop, for each i, it calculates tax8 as 8% of i and tax10 as 10% of i, both rounded down to the nearest integer.

The loop checks if both tax8 equals a and tax10 equals b. If both conditions are met, it prints the value of i and exits the program.

For i = 25, tax8 = (int)(25 * 0.08) = 2 and tax10 = (int)(25 * 0.1) = 2.5 which is rounded down to 2. Both conditions are met, so the program prints 25 and exits.

Since the conditions are met and the program exits during the first iteration, the loop does not continue and the program does not print -1.
