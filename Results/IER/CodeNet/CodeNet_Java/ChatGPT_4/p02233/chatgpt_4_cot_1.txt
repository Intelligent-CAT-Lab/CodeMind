<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method and a recursive `fib` method to calculate the nth Fibonacci number using memoization to optimize the calculation. The `memo` array is used to store the results of previously calculated Fibonacci numbers to avoid redundant calculations.

The `fib` method checks if the nth Fibonacci number has already been calculated and stored in the `memo` array. If it has, it returns the stored value. If not, it checks if `n` is 0 or 1, in which case it returns 1 and stores it in the `memo` array. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself to calculate `fib(n-1)` and `fib(n-2)`, stores those values in the `memo` array, and returns their sum.

The `main` method creates a `Scanner` object to read an integer from the standard input, which is passed to the `fib` method. The result of the `fib` method is then printed to the standard output.

Given the input `3`, the `main` method will call `fib(3)`. The `fib` method will find that `memo[3]` is 0 (since the array is initialized with zeros), so it will proceed to calculate `fib(2)` and `fib(1)`.

- `fib(1)` returns 1 since `n` is 1.
- `fib(2)` will need to calculate `fib(1)` (which returns 1) and `fib(0)` (which also returns 1), so `fib(2)` returns 2.
- Finally, `fib(3)` will return the sum of `fib(2)` and `fib(1)`, which is 2 + 1 = 3.

The output will be the result of `fib(3)`, which is 3.
