<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a method `digits` that calculates the sum of the digits of a given long number `n`. In the `main` method, an `InputReader` object is created to read input from the system input stream. The input `12` is read as a long value and assigned to the variable `n`.

The `digits` method is called with the input value `12`, and it calculates the sum of its digits:
- `12 % 10` gives `2`, and `12 / 10` gives `1`.
- `1 % 10` gives `1`, and `1 / 10` gives `0`.
The sum of the digits is `2 + 1 = 3`.

The `main` method then checks if `n` (which is `12`) is divisible by the sum of its digits (`3`). Since `12 % 3` equals `0`, the condition is true.

Therefore, the program prints "Yes" because `12` is divisible by the sum of its digits (`3`).

<<<Output>>>
Yes
