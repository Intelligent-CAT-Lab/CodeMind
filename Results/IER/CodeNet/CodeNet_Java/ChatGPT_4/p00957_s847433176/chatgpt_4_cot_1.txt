The input is `5 3`, which means `l` is initialized to 5 and `k` is initialized to 3. The array `dp` is initialized with a size of 101 (MAX_L + 1), and the first two elements `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` are set to 1.

The for loop starts with `i = 2` and runs until `i < l` (i.e., `i < 5`). Inside the loop, the following steps are performed:
- For `i = 2`, `num` is calculated as `i - k - 1` which is `2 - 3 - 1 = -2`. Since this is less than 0, `num` is set to 0. Then `dp[2]` is set to `dp[0] + num + 1`, which is `1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.
- For `i = 3`, `num` is `3 - 3 - 1 = -1`, which is less than 0, so `num` is set to 0. Then `dp[3]` is set to `dp[1] + num + 1`, which is `1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.
- For `i = 4`, `num` is `4 - 3 - 1 = 0`, so `num` is `dp[0]` which is 1. Then `dp[4]` is set to `dp[2] + num + 1`, which is `2 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

After the loop, `dp[l]` is calculated as `dp[l - 1] + (l >= k ? dp[l - k] : 0)`. Since `l` is 5 and `k` is 3, `l >= k` is true, so `dp[5]` is `dp[4] + dp[2]`, which is `4 + 2 = 6`.

Finally, the program prints the value of `dp[l]`, which is `dp[5]`, and the output is 6.
