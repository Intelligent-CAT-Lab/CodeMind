<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, X and Y, from the input. The input provided is `81 58`, so X is assigned the value 81 and Y is assigned the value 58.

The code then calculates the expression `X + Y / 2`. According to Java's order of operations, division is performed before addition, so `Y / 2` is calculated first. The division of Y (which is 58) by 2 results in 29, because in Java, the division of two integers results in an integer value (integer division).

After calculating `Y / 2`, the result (29) is added to X (which is 81). The final result of the expression `81 + 29` is 110.

The code then prints the result of the expression to the standard output using `System.out.println`.

Therefore, the output of the code execution will be 110.
