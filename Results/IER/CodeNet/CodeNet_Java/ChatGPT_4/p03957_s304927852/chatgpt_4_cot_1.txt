<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "CODEFESTIVAL". The program converts this string to a character array and then iterates over each character in the array. It uses two boolean flags, b1 and b2, to track the presence of characters 'C' and 'F' in that order.

Initially, both b1 and b2 are set to false. As the program iterates over the characters, it sets b1 to true when it encounters the character 'C'. After b1 is set to true, if the program encounters the character 'F', it sets b2 to true.

The iteration proceeds as follows:
- The character 'C' is encountered, so b1 is set to true.
- The characters 'O', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'E', 'S', 'T', 'I', 'V', 'A', 'L' are checked in sequence.
- When the character 'F' is encountered, since b1 is already true, b2 is set to true.

Since b2 is true at the end of the iteration, the program prints "Yes".
