<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "123456789". The variable `c` is initialized with 0.
The program enters a for loop that iterates over each character of the string `s`.
For each character, it converts the character to its corresponding integer value by subtracting the ASCII value of '0' from the ASCII value of the character. This is done using `(s.charAt(i)-'0')`.
The values of the digits are added to `c` one by one: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45.
After the loop, the program checks if `c` is divisible by 9 using `c % 9 == 0`.
Since 45 is divisible by 9, the condition is true.
Therefore, the program will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
