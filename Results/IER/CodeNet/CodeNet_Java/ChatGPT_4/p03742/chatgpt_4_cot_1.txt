<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `solve` method that is called from the `main` method. The `solve` method reads two long integers `X` and `Y` from the input using the `FastScanner` class, which is a custom input reader.

The `solve` method then calls `printlnYN` with the result of the expression `Math.abs(X-Y) <= 1`. This method prints "Brown" if the passed boolean is true and "Alice" if it is false.

Given the input `2 1`, the `solve` method will calculate the absolute difference between `X` (2) and `Y` (1), which is `1`. Since `1` is less than or equal to `1`, the expression evaluates to true.

Therefore, the `printlnYN` method will print "Brown" as the output.

Brown
