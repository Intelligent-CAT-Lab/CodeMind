<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `4 3`. The variable N is initialized with 4 and the variable d is initialized with 3.

The code checks the value of d and enters the else block since d is neither 1 nor 2.

Inside the else block, it calculates the value of m as N - d, which is 4 - 3 = 1.

Then it calculates the value of ans using the formula:
ans = m * (m - 1) / 2 + 2 * m + (d - 2)
Substituting the values of m and d, we get:
ans = 1 * (1 - 1) / 2 + 2 * 1 + (3 - 2)
ans = 0 / 2 + 2 + 1
ans = 0 + 2 + 1
ans = 3

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 3.

<<<Output>>>
3
