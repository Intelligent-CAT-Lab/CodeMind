<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `apple`. The main method reads this input using the `n()` method, which internally uses the `Scanner` object `sc` to read the next token of input as a `String`.

The input string `apple` is then converted to a character array `nn` and its length is stored in the variable `len`.

The program checks if the last character of the input string (which is `nn[len - 1]`) is 's'. Since the last character of `apple` is 'e', the condition is false.

Therefore, the `else` block is executed, which appends "s" to the input string and prints it using the `out` method.

The output will be the input string `apple` concatenated with "s", resulting in "apples".
