<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to solve a problem where we have three types of bills: 10,000 yen, 5,000 yen, and 1,000 yen. The variable X represents the total number of bills, and Y represents the total amount of money. The goal is to find the number of each type of bill that adds up to the total amount Y using exactly X bills.

The variables a, b, and c will represent the number of 10,000 yen, 5,000 yen, and 1,000 yen bills, respectively. The variable sum will hold the total amount of money calculated with the current combination of bills.

The code uses two nested for loops to iterate through all possible combinations of 10,000 yen and 5,000 yen bills, calculating the number of 1,000 yen bills by subtracting the number of the other two types from X. For each combination, it calculates the total sum of money and checks if it equals Y.

Given the input `9 45000`, the code will try to find a combination of 9 bills that add up to 45,000 yen.

The first combination that satisfies the condition sum == Y is when i = 4 and k = 0. This gives us:
- 10,000 yen bills (a): 4
- 5,000 yen bills (b): 0
- 1,000 yen bills (c): 9 - 4 - 0 = 5

The sum for this combination is 4 * 10,000 + 0 * 5,000 + 5 * 1,000 = 40,000 + 5,000 = 45,000, which matches Y.

Since the condition is met, the code sets judge to true and breaks out of the inner loop. The outer loop continues, but since judge is already true, it will not change the values of a, b, and c anymore.

Finally, the code checks if judge is true and prints the values of a, b, and c separated by spaces. If no combination was found, it would print "-1 -1 -1".
