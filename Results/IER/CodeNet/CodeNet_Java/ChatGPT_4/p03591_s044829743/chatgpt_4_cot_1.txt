<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with the `main` method and a `FastScanner` class to read input from the standard input stream. The `main` method creates an instance of `FastScanner` and a `PrintWriter` for output.

The `FastScanner` class has methods to read bytes from the input stream and convert them into strings, integers, and longs. It uses a buffer to read chunks of data from the input stream for efficiency.

The `main` method uses the `next` method of `FastScanner` to read a string `s` from the input. In this case, the input is "YAKINIKU".

The `indexOf` method is used to check if the string "YAKI" is at the beginning (index 0) of the string `s`. If it is, the program prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

For the given input "YAKINIKU", the string "YAKI" is indeed at the beginning of the string. Therefore, the condition `s.indexOf("YAKI") == 0` evaluates to `true`.

The `PrintWriter` then prints "Yes" to the standard output and flushes the stream to ensure the output is written.
