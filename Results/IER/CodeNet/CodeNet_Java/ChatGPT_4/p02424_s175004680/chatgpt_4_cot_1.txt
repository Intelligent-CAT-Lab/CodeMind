<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers from the input, which are 8 and 10 in this case. It then performs three bitwise operations on these numbers: AND, OR, and XOR, and prints the results in binary form, padded with zeros to make a 32-bit string.

1. The binary representation of 8 is 1000, and of 10 is 1010.
2. The AND operation (num1 & num2) on 8 (1000) and 10 (1010) results in 8 (1000), because both have the fourth bit set to 1.
3. The OR operation (num1 | num2) on 8 (1000) and 10 (1010) results in 10 (1010), because at least one of the numbers has the bit set to 1 in each position.
4. The XOR operation (num1 ^ num2) on 8 (1000) and 10 (1010) results in 2 (0010), because the bits are different in the third position.

The zeroLine method will pad these binary strings with leading zeros to make them 32 characters long.

The printStr method will print the last 32 characters of the strings, which will be the padded binary strings themselves since they are already 32 characters long after padding.

The expected output will be the binary representations of 8, 10, and 2, each padded with zeros to make a 32-bit string.
