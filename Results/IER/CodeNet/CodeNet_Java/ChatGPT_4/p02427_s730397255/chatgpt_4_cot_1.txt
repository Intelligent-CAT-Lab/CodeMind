<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `4`, which is assigned to the variable `n`. The program then enters a for loop that iterates from `0` to `(1 << n) - 1`, which is `0` to `15` in this case, because `1 << n` is `1` shifted left by `n` bits, which equals `16` when `n` is `4`.

For each iteration `i`, a new `Vector<Integer>` named `va` is created. Another nested for loop iterates from `0` to `n - 1` (0 to 3 in this case). Inside this nested loop, the program checks if the `j`th bit of `i` is set (i.e., not equal to `0`) by performing a bitwise AND between `i` and `1 << j`. If the bit is set, the value of `j` is added to the vector `va`.

After the nested loop, the program prints the current value of `i` followed by a colon. Then it prints the contents of the vector `va`, which contains the indices of the bits that were set in `i`. Each number is preceded by a space.

This process generates all the subsets of the set `{0, 1, 2, 3}` represented by the indices of the bits that are set in the binary representation of `i`.

The output will be the binary representation of numbers from `0` to `15` (inclusive) in terms of the set bits, with each set bit's index being printed.
