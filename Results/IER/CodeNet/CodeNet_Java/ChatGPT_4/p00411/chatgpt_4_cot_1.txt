<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the double variables a, t, and r, respectively. The values of a, t, and r are initialized with 180, 120, and 90 according to the input.

The code then calculates the expression r * t / a, which is 90 * 120 / 180. This simplifies to 10800 / 180, which equals 60.0. Since the variables are of type double, the result will also be a double value.

Finally, the code prints the result of the calculation and closes the Scanner object. The output will be the result of the calculation, which is 60.0.

<<<Output>>>
60.0
