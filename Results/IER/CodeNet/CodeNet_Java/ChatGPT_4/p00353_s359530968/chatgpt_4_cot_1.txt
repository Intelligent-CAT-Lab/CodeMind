<<<Analysis>>>
The variables m, f, and b are initialized with 1000, 3000, and 3000 respectively according to the input.
The code then checks if m is greater than or equal to b. Since m (1000) is not greater than or equal to b (3000), it goes to the else if condition.
The else if condition checks if m + f is greater than or equal to b. Since m + f (1000 + 3000 = 4000) is indeed greater than b (3000), the condition is true.
Therefore, it calculates b - m, which is 3000 - 1000 = 2000, and prints this value.
<<<Output>>>
2000
