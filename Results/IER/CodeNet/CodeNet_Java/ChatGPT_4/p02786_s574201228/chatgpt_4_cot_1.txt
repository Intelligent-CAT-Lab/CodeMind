<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h is initialized with the value 2 according to the input. The variable x is initialized with the value 1.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as h is not equal to 1.
In the first iteration, h is 2, which is not equal to 1, so the loop executes. Inside the loop, h is divided by 2, which results in h becoming 1. Then, x is multiplied by 2 (x becomes 2) and 1 is added to x (x becomes 3).
Since h is now equal to 1, the loop condition is no longer met, and the loop exits.
The final value of x, which is 3, is printed as the output.
<<<Output>>>
