<<<Analysis>>>
The input `1 1` initializes N with 1 and K with 1.

The `solve` method is called to compute the answer. Inside `solve`, the average `avg` is calculated as `K + K+N+N-1`, which is `1 + 1+1+1-1 = 3`.

An array `abi` of size N (which is 1) and 3 columns is created. A for loop runs from 0 to N-1 (which is 0 to 0, so only one iteration), and for each iteration, it calculates `a` as `K+i` (which is `1+0 = 1`) and `b` as `avg - a` (which is `3 - 1 = 2`). These values are stored in `abi[0][0]` and `abi[0][1]` respectively.

Since N is 1, `n` is set to 1, and `abi[0][2]` is not modified because the if condition `N % 2 == 1` is true.

The array `abi` is sorted based on the third column, but since there is only one element, it remains unchanged.

A new array `ans` of size N (which is 1) and 3 columns is created. A for loop runs from 0 to N-1 (which is 0 to 0, so only one iteration), and for each iteration, it calculates `c` as `K+N+N+i` (which is `1+1+1+0 = 3`). The values from `abi` are copied to `ans`, so `ans[0][0]` is `1`, `ans[0][1]` is `2`, and `ans[0][2]` is `3`.

Finally, the method checks if `ans[i][0] + ans[i][1]` is greater than `ans[i][2]` for any `i`. Since `1 + 2` is not greater than `3`, the check passes, and the method returns `ans`.

The main method then prints the values in `ans` using a PrintWriter, which results in the output `1 2 3`.
