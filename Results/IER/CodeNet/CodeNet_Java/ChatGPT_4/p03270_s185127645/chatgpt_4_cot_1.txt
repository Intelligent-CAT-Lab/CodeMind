<<<Analysis>>>
The input `3 3` initializes the variables `k` and `n` with the values 3 and 3, respectively.

The `cdp` array is a 2D array used for dynamic programming to store combinations, and it is filled up to `cdp[4000][4000]`. The `idp` array is another 2D array used for dynamic programming to store intermediate results, and it is filled up to `idp[2000][1000]`.

The `cdp` array is initialized such that `cdp[i][j]` will contain the number of combinations to choose `j` items from `i`, modulo `mod` (998244353). This is done using the formula `cdp[i][j] = cdp[i - 1][j] + cdp[i - 1][j - 1]`, which is the standard combination formula.

The `idp` array is initialized in a similar way, but only for even indices `i` and up to `i/2` for `j`. The initialization is slightly different, using the formula `idp[i][j] = idp[i - 2][j] + idp[i - 2][j - 1] * 2`.

The `ans` array is used to store the final answers for each value from 2 to `2 * k` (which is 6 in this case). The loop iterates over these values and calculates the answer based on the number of ways to distribute `n` items among `k` people, with some additional conditions based on whether `i` is even or odd.

For odd `i`, it calculates the answer using the `cdp` and `idp` arrays, considering the number of ways to distribute `n - j` items among `k - ni + j` people.

For even `i`, it calculates the answer twice: once considering the middle element (which reduces the problem to `n - j - 1` items and `k - ni + j` people) and once not considering the middle element (which is the same as the odd case).

After the loop, the `ans` array contains the final answers, which are printed out by the `OutputWriter`.

The output will be the values of `ans[i]` for `i` from 2 to `2 * k` (2 to 6 in this case), each on a new line.
