<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided initializes H and W to 3, and h and w to 2. The program checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w. Since neither 3 % 2 nor 3 % 2 is 0, the program prints "Yes" and continues.

The program then initializes a 2D array 'a' with dimensions H x W (3x3). It enters a nested loop where it iterates over the array in steps of h (2) for rows and w (2) for columns. In each iteration, it sets the current element to 1,000,000,000 - 1. It also checks if the bottom-right corner of the submatrix defined by h and w is within the bounds of the array. If it is, it sets that element to -1,000,000,000.

Given the dimensions of the array and the values of h and w, the loop will only execute once. The element a[0][0] will be set to 1,000,000,000 - 1, and the element a[1][1] (which is the bottom-right corner of the 2x2 submatrix starting at a[0][0]) will be set to -1,000,000,000.

After the loop, the program prints the array 'a'. The final array will look like this:

```
999999999 0 0
0 -1000000000 0
0 0 0
```

The zeros are default values for int in Java, as the array is not fully filled by the nested loops.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
999999999 0 0
0 -1000000000 0
0 0 0
