The input is `4`, which initializes the variable `n` with the value 4. The `solve` method is then called.

In the `solve` method, the `fac` and `iFac` arrays are initialized with a length of `n + 1`, which is 5 in this case. The `fillFactorials` method is called to fill these arrays.

The `fillFactorials` method initializes `fac[0]` and `iFac[0]` to 1. Then, it calculates the factorial of each number from 1 to 4 and stores it in `fac`. It also calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of each factorial and stores it in `iFac` using the `power` method.

After filling the factorials, the `solve` method checks if `n` is 2 or 3 and sets `ans` to 1 or 4, respectively. Since `n` is 4, it does not match these conditions, so it proceeds to the else block.

In the else block, it calculates the starting value of `k` as `n / 2` if `n` is even, or `(n + 1) / 2` if `n` is odd. Since `n` is 4, `start` is set to 2.

The for loop iterates from `k = 2` to `k = 3` (since `k < n` which is 4). Inside the loop, it calculates the number of ways using the `combination` method and the factorials, then updates `ans` with the difference between the current `ways` and `prevWays`, multiplied by `k`, and takes the modulo with `MOD`. The `prevWays` is updated to the current `ways` at the end of each iteration.

The `combination` method calculates the combination of `n` and `r` using the precomputed factorials and their inverses, taking the modulo with `MOD`.

After the loop, the final value of `ans` is printed.

For `k = 2`, the combination is `combination(1, 1)`, which is `1`. The number of ways is `(1 * fac[2] % MOD) * fac[1] % MOD`, which is `(1 * 2 % MOD) * 1 % MOD`, which is `2`. The `ans` is updated to `(0 + (2 - 0 + MOD) % MOD * 2 % MOD) % MOD`, which is `4`.

For `k = 3`, the combination is `combination(2, 0)`, which is `1`. The number of ways is `(1 * fac[3] % MOD) * fac[0] % MOD`, which is `(1 * 6 % MOD) * 1 % MOD`, which is `6`. The `ans` is updated to `(4 + (6 - 2 + MOD) % MOD * 3 % MOD) % MOD`, which is `(4 + 4 * 3 % MOD) % MOD`, which is `(4 + 12) % MOD`, which is `16`.

The final value of `ans` is `16`, which is printed as the output.
