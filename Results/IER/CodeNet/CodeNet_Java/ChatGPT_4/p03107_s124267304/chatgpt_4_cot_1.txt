<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "0011" is assigned to the variable s. The length of the string is 4, which is stored in the variable len.

The code then calculates the number of '0's in the string by replacing all '0's with an empty string and subtracting the length of the resulting string from the original length. In this case, s.replace("0", "") results in "11", which has a length of 2. Therefore, countRed is 4 - 2 = 2.

Similarly, the code calculates the number of '1's in the string by replacing all '1's with an empty string and subtracting the length of the resulting string from the original length. In this case, s.replace("1", "") results in "00", which has a length of 2. Therefore, countBlue is 4 - 2 = 2.

The result is the minimum of countRed and countBlue multiplied by 2. Since countRed and countBlue are both 2, the minimum is 2, and the result is 2 * 2 = 4.

Finally, the code prints the result, which is 4.
