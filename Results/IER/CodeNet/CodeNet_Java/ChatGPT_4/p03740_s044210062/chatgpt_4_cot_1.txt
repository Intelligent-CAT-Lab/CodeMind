<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method and a nested `FastScanner` class to read input efficiently. The `main` method creates an instance of `FastScanner`, reads two long integers `x` and `y` from the input, and then closes the scanner.

The input provided is `2 1`. The variables `x` and `y` are assigned these values respectively.

The code then checks the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using `Math.abs(x-y)`. If the absolute difference is greater than or equal to 2, it prints "Alice". Otherwise, it prints "Brown".

For the given input `2 1`, the absolute difference is `Math.abs(2-1)` which equals `1`. Since `1` is not greater than or equal to `2`, the condition `Math.abs(x-y)>=2` is false.

Therefore, the output will be "Brown" because the absolute difference between `x` and `y` is less than `2`.
