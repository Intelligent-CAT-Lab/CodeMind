<<<Analysis>>>
The Scanner object `sc` is created to read input from the standard input stream. Two characters, `A` and `B`, are read from the input. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.

The input provided is "A B", so the character `A` is assigned to variable `A` and the character `B` is assigned to variable `B`.

The program then checks if `A` is equal to `B`. Since 'A' is not equal to 'B', it moves to the next condition.

The next condition checks if `A` is greater than `B`. Since 'A' is not greater than 'B' in the ASCII table, it moves to the next condition.

The final condition checks if `A` is less than `B`. Since 'A' is less than 'B' in the ASCII table, the condition is true, and `ans` is set to '<'.

The program then prints the value of `ans`, which is '<'.
