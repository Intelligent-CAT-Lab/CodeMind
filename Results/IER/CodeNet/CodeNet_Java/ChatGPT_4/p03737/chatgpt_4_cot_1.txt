<<<Analysis>>>
The code uses a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It enters a for loop that iterates three times (i = 0, 1, 2). Inside the loop, it reads the next token from the input using sc.next(), which by default uses whitespace as a delimiter. It then takes the first character of this token using charAt(0), converts it to uppercase using Character.toUpperCase(), and prints it out without a newline after each character.

Given the input "atcoder beginner contest", the Scanner will read "atcoder" on the first iteration, "beginner" on the second iteration, and "contest" on the third iteration. For each of these tokens, it will take the first character ('a', 'b', 'c'), convert each to uppercase ('A', 'B', 'C'), and print them out consecutively. After the loop, it prints a newline character.

Therefore, the output will be the first letters of each word in uppercase, concatenated together: "ABC".
