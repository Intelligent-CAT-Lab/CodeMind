<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input, which are provided as "3 5".

The variable a is initialized with the value 3, and the variable b is initialized with the value 5.

The code then calculates the product of a and b, which is 3 * 5 = 15.

Next, it calculates the sum of the perimeters of a and b, which is 2 * (a + b) = 2 * (3 + 5) = 2 * 8 = 16.

Finally, it prints the result of the product followed by the result of the perimeter calculation, separated by a space.

<<<Output>>>
15 16
