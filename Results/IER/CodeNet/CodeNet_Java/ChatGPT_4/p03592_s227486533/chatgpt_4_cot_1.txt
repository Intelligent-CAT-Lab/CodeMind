<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a nested `Pair` class, a `solve` method, a `solve` helper method with a different signature, a `main` method, and a `FastReader` class for input handling.

The `main` method starts a new thread to run the `solve` method. The `solve` method initializes a `FastReader` object to read input from `System.in`. It reads three long integers `n`, `m`, and `k` with the values `2`, `2`, and `2` respectively.

The `solve` method then calls the helper `solve` method with the arguments `n`, `m`, and `k`. The helper `solve` method contains two nested loops that iterate over all combinations of `p1` from `0` to `n` and `q` from `0` to `m`. For each combination, it checks if the equation `p1 * m + q * n - 2 * p1 * q == k` holds true. If it finds a combination where the equation holds true, it returns `true`; otherwise, after all iterations, it returns `false`.

In this case, the equation simplifies to `p1 * 2 + q * 2 - 2 * p1 * q == 2`. The loops will find that when `p1 = 1` and `q = 1`, the equation holds true because `1 * 2 + 1 * 2 - 2 * 1 * 1 == 2`. Therefore, the helper `solve` method will return `true`.

Back in the `solve` method, if the helper `solve` method returns `true`, it prints "Yes" to the `PrintWriter` object `pw` and then closes `pw`. If it were to return `false`, it would print "No" instead.

Since the helper `solve` method returns `true`, the output will be "Yes".
