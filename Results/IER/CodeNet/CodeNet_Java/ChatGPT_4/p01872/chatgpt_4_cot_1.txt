The input string is "?12345678901?". The `solve` method is called, which first checks if the last character of the string is a '?'. Since it is, the program enters the first if block.

The program initializes `sum` to 0 and enters a for loop that iterates over the string, excluding the last character (which is '?'). The loop iterates from index 0 to index 10 (inclusive).

For each character in the string (except the last '?'), the program calculates a weight `q` based on the position `n` of the character in the string (from the right, 1-indexed). The weight `q` is calculated as follows:
- If `n` is between 1 and 6 (inclusive), `q` is `n + 1`.
- If `n` is between 7 and 11 (inclusive), `q` is `n - 5`.

The character at the current index `i` is converted from a character to an integer `p` by subtracting the ASCII value of '0'. Since the first character is '?', it is not processed in this loop.

The product of `q` and `p` is added to `sum` for each character. After the loop, `sum` is taken modulo 11.

If `sum` is less than or equal to 1, `sum` is set to 0. Otherwise, `sum` is set to `11 - sum`.

The program then prints the final value of `sum`.

Let's calculate the sum:
- For i = 0 (character '?'), it is skipped.
- For i = 1 (character '1'), n = 10, q = 5, p = 1, sum += 5 * 1 = 5.
- For i = 2 (character '2'), n = 9, q = 4, p = 2, sum += 4 * 2 = 8, sum = 5 + 8 = 13.
- For i = 3 (character '3'), n = 8, q = 3, p = 3, sum += 3 * 3 = 9, sum = 13 + 9 = 22.
- For i = 4 (character '4'), n = 7, q = 2, p = 4, sum += 2 * 4 = 8, sum = 22 + 8 = 30.
- For i = 5 (character '5'), n = 6, q = 7, p = 5, sum += 7 * 5 = 35, sum = 30 + 35 = 65.
- For i = 6 (character '6'), n = 5, q = 6, p = 6, sum += 6 * 6 = 36, sum = 65 + 36 = 101.
- For i = 7 (character '7'), n = 4, q = 5, p = 7, sum += 5 * 7 = 35, sum = 101 + 35 = 136.
- For i = 8 (character '8'), n = 3, q = 4, p = 8, sum += 4 * 8 = 32, sum = 136 + 32 = 168.
- For i = 9 (character '9'), n = 2, q = 3, p = 9, sum += 3 * 9 = 27, sum = 168 + 27 = 195.
- For i = 10 (character '0'), n = 1, q = 2, p = 0, sum += 2 * 0 = 0, sum = 195 + 0 = 195.

Now, `sum` is taken modulo 11: `sum %= 11`, so `sum = 195 % 11 = 8`.

Since `sum` is greater than 1, we calculate `sum = 11 - sum`, which gives `sum = 11 - 8 = 3`.

The program then prints the final value of `sum`, which is 3.
