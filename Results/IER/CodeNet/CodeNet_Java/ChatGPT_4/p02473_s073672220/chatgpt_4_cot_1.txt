<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads a line of input and splits it into two parts using the space character as a delimiter. These two parts are expected to be string representations of numbers.

The two parts of the input string are then converted into BigInteger objects, named `a` and `b`, with `a` being initialized with the first part of the input ("5") and `b` with the second part ("8").

The code then calculates the result of subtracting `b` from `a` using the `subtract` method of the BigInteger class, which is capable of handling arbitrarily large integers. The result of this subtraction is stored in a new BigInteger object named `c`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `c` to the standard output. Since `a` is 5 and `b` is 8, the subtraction will result in a negative number, specifically `-3`.

<<<Output>>>
-3
