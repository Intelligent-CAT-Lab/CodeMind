<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is initialized with "RUDLUDR". The string is split into an array li[] of individual characters ["R", "U", "D", "L", "U", "D", "R"].
The variable count is initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates over each character in the li[] array, checking the characters at even and odd indices separately.

- For i=0 (even index), the character is "R". The condition is satisfied (R, U, or D is allowed at even indices), so count remains 0.
- For i=1 (odd index), the character is "U". The condition is satisfied (L, U, or D is allowed at odd indices), so count remains 0.
- For i=2 (even index), the character is "D". The condition is satisfied, so count remains 0.
- For i=3 (odd index), the character is "L". The condition is satisfied, so count remains 0.
- For i=4 (even index), the character is "U". The condition is satisfied, so count remains 0.
- For i=5 (odd index), the character is "D". The condition is satisfied, so count remains 0.
- For i=6 (even index), the character is "R". The condition is satisfied, so count remains 0.

Since count is 0 after the loop, the program prints "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
