The code defines a `Main` class that implements `Runnable` and contains a `main` method that starts a new thread with the `Main` class itself as the runnable target. The `run` method is where the actual logic of the program is executed.

The `run` method uses a `FastScanner` class to read two integers `n` and `k` from the input. In this case, `n` is 10 and `k` is 5.

The `partition` method is called with arguments `n-k` and `k`, which in this case are `10-5` and `5`, resulting in `partition(5, 5)`.

The `partition` method calculates the number of ways to express `n` as the sum of `k` non-negative integers. This is done using dynamic programming (DP).

The DP table `dp` is a 2D array with dimensions `n+1` by `k+1`. The base cases are set as follows:
- `dp[0][0]` is set to 1 because there is one way to express 0 as the sum of 0 numbers.
- All `dp[i][1]` are set to 1 because there is one way to express any number `i` as the sum of 1 number (the number itself).
- `dp[0][i]` and `dp[1][i]` for `i` from 2 to `k` are set to 1 because there is one way to express 0 as the sum of any number of numbers (all zeros) and one way to express 1 as the sum of any number of numbers (all zeros except one 1).

The DP recurrence relation is as follows:
- If `i-j` is non-negative, `dp[i][j]` is the sum of `dp[i][j-1]` (the number of ways to express `i` as the sum of `j-1` numbers) and `dp[i-j][j]` (the number of ways to express `i-j` as the sum of `j` numbers).
- If `i-j` is negative, `dp[i][j]` is simply `dp[i][j-1]`.

The final answer is `dp[n][k]`, which is the number of ways to express `n` as the sum of `k` non-negative integers.

For the input `10 5`, the `partition` method is called with `5, 5`. The DP table is filled out according to the rules above, and the final answer is calculated and returned.

The output is the value of `dp[5][5]`, which is the number of ways to express 5 as the sum of 5 non-negative integers.

Let's calculate the DP table manually:
- `dp[0][0]` to `dp[5][1]` are all 1.
- `dp[0][2]` to `dp[0][5]` and `dp[1][2]` to `dp[1][5]` are all 1.
- For `i=2` to `5` and `j=2` to `5`, we fill the table using the recurrence relation.

The final DP table will look like this (only the relevant part shown):
```
dp[2][2] = dp[2][1] + dp[0][2] = 1 + 1 = 2
dp[3][2] = dp[3][1] + dp[1][2] = 1 + 1 = 2
dp[3][3] = dp[3][2] + dp[0][3] = 2 + 1 = 3
dp[4][2] = dp[4][1] + dp[2][2] = 1 + 2 = 3
dp[4][3] = dp[4][2] + dp[1][3] = 3 + 1 = 4
dp[4][4] = dp[4][3] + dp[0][4] = 4 + 1 = 5
dp[5][2] = dp[5][1] + dp[3][2] = 1 + 2 = 3
dp[5][3] = dp[5][2] + dp[2][3] = 3 + 2 = 5
dp[5][4] = dp[5][3] + dp[1][4] = 5 + 1 = 6
dp[5][5] = dp[5][4] + dp[0][5] = 6 + 1 =
