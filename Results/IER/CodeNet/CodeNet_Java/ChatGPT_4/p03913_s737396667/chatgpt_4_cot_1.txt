The input `8 1` initializes the variables `n` with 8 and `a` with 1. The `solve` method in the `Solver` class is then called to find the minimum time to eat all cookies.

The `solve` method iterates with `eatCount` from 1 to 40 and calls `calculateCookieTime(eatCount)` each time. The `calculateCookieTime` method calculates the time it would take to eat all cookies if the character eats `eatCount` cookies at a time.

Inside `calculateCookieTime`, there is a nested loop. The outer loop increments `v` starting from 2 until `pow(v, eatCount + 1)` is greater than or equal to `n`. The inner loop increments `j` starting from 0 until `pow(v - 1, eatCount + 1 - j) * pow(v, j)` is greater than or equal to `n`. When the condition is met, it returns `eatCount * a + (v - 1) * (eatCount + 1 - j) + v * j`.

For `eatCount = 1`, `v` will be found to be 3 because `pow(3, 2)` is 9 which is greater than 8. Then, `j` will be 0 because `pow(2, 2) * pow(3, 0)` is 4 which is not greater than 8, but `pow(2, 1) * pow(3, 1)` is 6 which is still not greater than 8, and finally `pow(2, 0) * pow(3, 2)` is 9 which is greater than 8. So, the time taken for `eatCount = 1` is `1 * 1 + (3 - 1) * (1 + 1 - 0) + 3 * 0` which is `1 + 4 + 0` which is 5.

The `solve` method will continue to find the minimum time for `eatCount` from 1 to 40, but since the time for `eatCount = 1` is already 5, and the time cannot be less than `n` itself (which is 8), the minimum time cannot be less than 5.

Therefore, the output will be 5, as no other `eatCount` will yield a smaller result.
