The input `615` is assigned to the variable `X`. The array `a` is initialized with the values `{100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105}`.

A boolean array `dp` of size `X+1` (616 elements) is created and all elements are set to `false`, except for `dp[0]` which is set to `true`. This array will be used for dynamic programming to determine if it's possible to create the sum `X` using any combination of the values in `a`.

The code then iterates over each value from `1` to `615` (inclusive) and for each value `i`, it checks if `i` can be formed by adding any of the values in `a` to a smaller value `i - yen` for which `dp[i - yen]` is `true`. If such a combination is found, `dp[i]` is set to `true`.

The loop checks for each `i` if `dp[i]` can be set to `true` by iterating over the array `a` and checking if `dp[i - yen]` is `true` for any `yen` in `a`. If `i - yen` is negative, it skips the check.

After the loop, the code checks if `dp[X]` is `true`. If it is, it means that `X` can be formed by summing up some combination of the values in `a`. If `dp[X]` is `true`, the code prints `1`, otherwise it prints `0`.

Let's consider the first few iterations:
- For `i = 100`, `dp[100]` will be set to `true` because `dp[0]` is `true` and `100` is in `a`.
- For `i = 101`, `dp[101]` will be set to `true` because `dp[0]` is `true` and `101` is in `a`.
- ...
- This will continue for all values in `a`.

Since all values in `a` are between `100` and `105`, and `X` is `615`, which is a sum of six `100`s and one `15`, and since `15` can be formed by `10` (which is `100 - 90`, and `dp[90]` will eventually be `true`) and `5` (which is `105 - 100`, and `dp[100]` is `true`), `dp[615]` will eventually be set to `true`.

Therefore, the output will be `1`, indicating that it is possible to form `615` using the values in `a`.
