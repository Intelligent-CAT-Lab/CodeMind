The code defines a `Main` class with a `quickSort` method for sorting an array, an `arrayPrintln` method for printing an array in reverse order, and a `main` method to read input, sort it, and print it.

The `main` method initializes a Scanner to read from `System.in`. It reads five integers from the input and stores them in the `inp` array. The input provided is `3 6 9 7 5`.

After reading the input, the `quickSort` method is called with the `inp` array, the starting index `0`, and the last index `4`. The `quickSort` method is a recursive implementation of the QuickSort algorithm. It selects a pivot (the middle element of the array), partitions the array into elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot, and then recursively sorts the two partitions.

The sorting process is as follows:
1. The initial pivot is `9` (the middle element).
2. The array is partitioned into two parts: `3 6 5 7 | 9`. The elements `3 6 5 7` are less than `9`, and there are no elements greater than `9` to the right.
3. The left partition `3 6 5 7` is then sorted. The new pivot is `5`.
4. The array is partitioned into `3 | 5 6 7`. The elements `3` are less than `5`, and `6 7` are greater than `5`.
5. The left partition containing only `3` is already sorted.
6. The right partition `6 7` is then sorted. The pivot is `6`.
7. The array is partitioned into `6 | 7`. Both `6` and `7` are already in the correct order.
8. The entire array is now sorted: `3 5 6 7 9`.

Finally, the `arrayPrintln` method is called to print the sorted array in reverse order. The output will be `9 7 6 5 3`.
