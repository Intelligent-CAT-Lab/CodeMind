<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` that implements `Runnable` and contains a `main` method that starts a new thread with a larger stack size. The `run` method of the `Main` class creates a `Scanner` object to read input from `System.in` and then calls the `solve` method with this scanner.

The `solve` method reads two integers `X` and `Y` from the input. It initializes an `ans` variable to 0. It then calculates the prize money based on the values of `X` and `Y`. The prize money is calculated as follows:

- It adds to `ans` the result of `Math.max(0, 4 - X) * 100000`. This means that if `X` is less than 4, it adds `(4 - X) * 100000` to `ans`. If `X` is 4 or greater, it adds 0.
- It does the same for `Y`, adding `Math.max(0, 4 - Y) * 100000` to `ans`.
- If both `X` and `Y` are equal to 1, it adds an additional 400000 to `ans`.

Given the input `1 1`, the calculations will be as follows:

- For `X = 1`, `Math.max(0, 4 - 1)` is 3, so `ans` increases by `3 * 100000`, which is `300000`.
- For `Y = 1`, similarly, `ans` increases by another `300000`.
- Since both `X` and `Y` are 1, it adds an additional `400000` to `ans`.

Therefore, `ans` will be `300000 + 300000 + 400000`, which equals `1000000`.
