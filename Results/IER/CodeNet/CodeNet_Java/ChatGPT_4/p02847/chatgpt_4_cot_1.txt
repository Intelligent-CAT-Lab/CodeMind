<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate the number of days until the next Sunday given the current day of the week. The input "SAT" corresponds to Saturday.

The `days` array contains the abbreviations of the days of the week starting from Monday. The input "SAT" is read and stored in the variable `in`.

The for loop iterates through the `days` array to find the index of the input day. When it finds "SAT", it breaks out of the loop with the index value of 5 (since arrays are 0-indexed and "SAT" is the 6th element).

The variable `ans` is calculated using the formula `((6-idx+7)%7)`. Substituting the value of `idx` (which is 5), we get `((6-5+7)%7)`, which simplifies to `(8%7)`, resulting in `1`.

Since `ans` is not equal to 0, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is `1`.

The `pw.flush()` method is called to ensure that the output is actually sent to `System.out`.
