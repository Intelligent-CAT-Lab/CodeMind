<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a nested static class `Scanner` that is used to read input from the standard input stream. The `Scanner` class has methods to read integers, longs, and strings, and to fill arrays with these types.

The `main` method of the `Main` class creates an instance of the `Scanner` class and reads two integers, `N` and `K`, from the input. In this case, the input is `2 2`, so `N` is assigned the value 2 and `K` is assigned the value 2.

The `main` method then calculates the result of the expression `K * Math.pow(K - 1, N - 1)`. With the given input, this expression evaluates to `2 * Math.pow(2 - 1, 2 - 1)`, which simplifies to `2 * Math.pow(1, 1)`. Since any number to the power of 1 is itself, the expression further simplifies to `2 * 1`, which equals 2.

The result of the calculation is then printed to the standard output. Therefore, the output of the code execution will be 2.
