<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the input, which are 4 and 5 respectively. It then calculates the remainder of a when divided by 3 (c = 4 % 3), which is 1. It does the same for b (d = 5 % 3), which is 2. Then it calculates the remainder of the sum of a and b when divided by 3 (e = (4 + 5) % 3), which is 0.

The if statement checks if any of c, d, or e is equal to 0. Since e is 0, the condition is true. Therefore, the code will print "Possible".

<<<Output>>>
Possible
