<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and x are initialized with 4, 8, and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable count is initialized with 0.
The code calculates the number of multiples of x between a and b (inclusive) by subtracting the number of multiples of x up to a-1 from the number of multiples of x up to b. This is done by dividing b by x and subtracting the result of dividing a by x from it.
The result of b/x is 8/2 which equals 4.
The result of a/x is 4/2 which equals 2.
So, count = 4 - 2 which equals 2.
Then, the code checks if a is a multiple of x by checking if a%x equals 0. Since 4%2 equals 0, a is a multiple of x, and therefore count is incremented by 1.
Now, count = 2 + 1 which equals 3.
Finally, the code prints the value of count.
