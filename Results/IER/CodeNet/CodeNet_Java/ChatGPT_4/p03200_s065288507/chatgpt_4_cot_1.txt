<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "BBW" is converted to a character array `arr` with the elements {'B', 'B', 'W'}.
The variables `count` and `blackCount` are initialized to 0.
The program enters a for loop that iterates over the elements of the array `arr`.

1. In the first iteration (i=0), `arr[i]` is 'B', so `blackCount` is incremented by 1 (blackCount = 1).
2. In the second iteration (i=1), `arr[i]` is again 'B', so `blackCount` is incremented by 1 (blackCount = 2).
3. In the third iteration (i=2), `arr[i]` is 'W', so the current `blackCount` (which is 2) is added to `count` (count = 0 + 2).

The loop ends as there are no more elements in the array.
The final value of `count` is 2, which is printed as the output.
