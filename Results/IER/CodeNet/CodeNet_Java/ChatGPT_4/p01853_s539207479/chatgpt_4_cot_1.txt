<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner to read from standard input. It then reads two integers, n and m, which are 3 and 100 respectively according to the input.

An integer array ns of size n (3 in this case) is created. All elements of the array are initialized to 0 by default in Java.

The code checks if n is greater than 2, which it is. It then enters a for loop that starts from n/2 + 1 (which is 3/2 + 1 = 2) and goes up to n - 1 (which is 3 - 1 = 2). Since the loop starts and ends at 2, it will only execute once for i = 2.

Inside the loop, the code sets the value of ns[i] to m, which is 100. So, ns[2] is set to 100.

After the loop, the code prints the elements of the array ns separated by spaces. Since ns[0] and ns[1] were not modified, they remain 0. ns[2] was set to 100.

Therefore, the output will be "0 0 100".
