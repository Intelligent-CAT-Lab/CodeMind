The input `1 1 2 2` initializes A, B, C, and D to 1, 1, 2, and 2 respectively. The DP array is initialized with dimensions [C+1][D+1], which is [3][3], and all values are set to -1. DP[C][D] or DP[2][2] is then set to 1.

The solve method is called with parameters (A, B) which are (1, 1). Since DP[1][1] is -1, it proceeds to calculate the value.

The boolean variables leftA and leftB are true because (C - a) = (2 - 1) > 0 and (D - b) = (2 - 1) > 0.

The recursive calls are made as follows:
- solve(2, 1) because leftA is true, which multiplies the result by b (1 in this case).
- solve(1, 2) because leftB is true, which multiplies the result by a (1 in this case).
- solve(2, 2) because both leftA and leftB are true, which subtracts the result multiplied by a*b (1*1 in this case).

The solve(2, 1) call will return 0 because there are no more leftA (C - a = 0) and the DP[2][1] is still -1, so it will be set to 0.

The solve(1, 2) call will return 0 for the same reason as solve(2, 1).

The solve(2, 2) call will return 1 because DP[2][2] was set to 1 earlier.

So, the initial call to solve(1, 1) will calculate v as follows:
v = 1 * 0 (from solve(2, 1)) + 1 * 0 (from solve(1, 2)) - 1 * 1 (from solve(2, 2))
v = 0 + 0 - 1
v = -1

Since v is negative, it is adjusted to be within the range of MOD by adding MOD and taking the modulus again:
v = (-1 % 998244353 + 998244353) % 998244353
v = 998244352

DP[1][1] is set to 998244352, and the final output is the result of solve(A, B), which is solve(1, 1), so the output is 998244352.
