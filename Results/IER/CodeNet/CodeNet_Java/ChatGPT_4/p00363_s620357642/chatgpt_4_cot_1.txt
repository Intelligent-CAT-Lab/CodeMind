<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into three parts: yoko, tate, and moji, which are assigned the values 3, 3, and "B" respectively. It then initializes an array of strings called hata with a size equal to tate (3).

The code then enters two nested for loops to construct a frame with the given dimensions (yoko x tate) and places the character moji ("B") in the center of the frame. The outer loop iterates over the width (yoko), and the inner loop iterates over the height (tate).

For the first and last columns (i == 0 or i == yoko - 1), it adds "+" to the first and last strings in hata and "|" to the rest of the strings in between. For the other columns, it adds "-" to the first and last strings in hata and "." to the rest, except for the center of the frame, where it adds the character moji ("B") if it is the center column (i == (yoko - 1) / 2).

After constructing the frame, the code prints out each string in the hata array, which represents each row of the frame.

Given the input `3 3 B`, the frame will be 3 characters wide and 3 characters tall, with a "B" in the center. The expected output will be a 3x3 frame with "+" at the corners, "-" at the top and bottom sides, "|" at the left and right sides, and a "B" in the center.
