<<<Analysis>>>
The input "100" is read and converted to a character array n = {'1', '0', '0'}.
The variable flag is initialized to false.
A for loop starts at index 1 and checks if any character in the array n is not '9'. Since n[1] is '0', the condition is met, and flag is set to true and the loop breaks.
The variable ans is calculated as follows:
- Since flag is true, the second calculation is used.
- The first character of n is '1', so ('1' - '0') equals 1.
- The length of n is 3, so there are 2 characters after the first one.
- The calculation becomes (1 - 1) + 9 * (3 - 1), which simplifies to 0 + 9 * 2.
- The final result is 0 + 18, which equals 18.
The value of ans, which is 18, is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
18
