The input is split into five integers: A = 1500, B = 2000, C = 1600, X = 3, and Y = 2.

The code calculates the cost of pizzas in three different ways and then outputs the minimum cost.

1. Buying X A-pizzas and Y B-pizzas individually:
   resultA = X * A + Y * B
   resultA = 3 * 1500 + 2 * 2000
   resultA = 4500 + 4000
   resultA = 8500

2. Using AB-pizzas (which can be used as either A or B) and then buying the remaining pizzas individually:
   Since X > Y, it calculates the cost by buying Y AB-pizzas and the remaining (X - Y) A-pizzas:
   resultB = (X - Y) * A + Y * C * 2
   resultB = (3 - 2) * 1500 + 2 * 1600 * 2
   resultB = 1500 + 3200 * 2
   resultB = 1500 + 6400
   resultB = 7900

3. Buying only AB-pizzas for the larger of X or Y:
   resultC = C * (Math.max(X, Y)) * 2
   resultC = 1600 * (Math.max(3, 2)) * 2
   resultC = 1600 * 3 * 2
   resultC = 1600 * 6
   resultC = 9600

Finally, the code outputs the minimum of the three calculated costs:
   Math.min(Math.min(resultA, resultB), resultC)
   Math.min(Math.min(8500, 7900), 9600)
   Math.min(7900, 9600)
   7900

<<<Output>>>
7900
