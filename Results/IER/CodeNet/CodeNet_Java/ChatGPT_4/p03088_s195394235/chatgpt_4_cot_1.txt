<<<Analysis>>>
The input `3` initializes the variable `n` with the value 3. The code is designed to calculate the number of ways to fill an array of length `n` with integers from 0 to 3 (inclusive) under certain conditions.

A 4-dimensional array `dp` is created with dimensions 4x4x4x(n-3+1), which in this case is 4x4x4x1 since `n` is 3. This array will be used for dynamic programming to store the number of valid sequences of length `m+1` ending with the sequence `[i][j][k]`.

The loops initialize the `dp` array such that `dp[i][j][k][0]` is 1 for all `i`, `j`, `k` except for the sequences `[0][1][2]`, `[0][2][1]`, and `[1][0][2]`, which are set to 0. These sequences are not allowed due to the problem's constraints.

Since `n` is 3, the outermost loop `for(int m=0; m<n-3; m++)` will not execute because `n-3` is 0. Therefore, the `dp` array will not be updated further, and the initial values will remain.

Finally, the code sums up all the values in `dp[i][j][k][n-3]`, which is `dp[i][j][k][0]` in this case. Since `n` is 3, we are looking at sequences of length 3 (0-indexed, so we use `n-3`).

The sum will be the total number of valid sequences of length 3, which is the sum of all `dp[i][j][k][0]` values except for the sequences `[0][1][2]`, `[0][2][1]`, and `[1][0][2]`. There are 4x4x4 = 64 possible sequences, and we subtract the 3 invalid ones, resulting in 61.

The sum is then printed as the output.
