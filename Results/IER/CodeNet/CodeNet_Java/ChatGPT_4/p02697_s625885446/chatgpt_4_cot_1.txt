<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `4 1`, which means n=4 and m=1. The program starts by reading these two values.

The program then checks if n is odd, which it is not (since 4 is even), so it skips the if block.

Next, the program initializes two variables i and j to n/2 and n/2 + 1, respectively. In this case, i=2 and j=3.

The program enters a while loop that continues as long as the difference between j and i is less than n/2 and m is greater than 0. Since m is 1, the loop will execute at least once. The condition (j - i) < n/2 is also true because (3 - 2) < 2.

Inside the loop, it prints the pair (i, j) using the Util.join method, which simply joins the two numbers with a space. After printing, it decrements i, increments j, and decrements m. The values become i=1, j=4, and m=0.

Since m is now 0, the loop terminates, and the program does not enter the second while loop.

The output will be the result of the Util.join method call with the arguments i=1 and j=4, which is "1 4".
