The variable N is initialized with 8 according to the input. An ArrayList of Long type named num is created to store the numbers that satisfy the given condition.
The for loop iterates from 1 to the square root of N (which is less than 3 in this case, since the square root of 8 is approximately 2.8284). The loop will iterate for i = 1 and i = 2.
For each iteration, the code checks if (N - i) is divisible by i and if (N - i) / i is greater than i. If both conditions are met, it adds (N - i) / i to the ArrayList num.

For i = 1:
(N - i) % i = (8 - 1) % 1 = 7 % 1 = 0 (condition is met)
(N - i) / i = (8 - 1) / 1 = 7 / 1 = 7
Since 7 is greater than 1, the number 7 is added to the ArrayList num.

For i = 2:
(N - i) % i = (8 - 2) % 2 = 6 % 2 = 0 (condition is met)
(N - i) / i = (8 - 2) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3
Since 3 is greater than 2, the number 3 is added to the ArrayList num.

The ArrayList num now contains the numbers [7, 3].

The variable ans is initialized with 0. A for-each loop iterates over the ArrayList num and adds each number to ans.
ans = 0 + 7 + 3 = 10

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
