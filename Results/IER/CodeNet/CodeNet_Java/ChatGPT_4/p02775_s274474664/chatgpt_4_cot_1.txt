The input "36" is read as a string and stored in the variable N. A character array W is created with a length one greater than the length of N, and the first element of W is set to '0'. The characters of N are then copied into W starting from the second position.

The array W now looks like this: ['0', '3', '6'].

The method sum is called with the array W and the index of the last element, which is 2.

In the sum method, the following steps occur:
1. The character at W[2] is '6', which is converted to the integer 6 (keta = 6).
2. Since to is not 0, it checks if keta is less than 5, equal to 5, or greater than 5.
3. Since keta is greater than 5, the add method is called with W and to-1 (which is 1).
4. In the add method, since W[1] is '3' and less than '8', it is incremented to '4'.
5. The add method returns, and the sum method continues with (10 - keta) + sum(N, to-1), which is (10 - 6) + sum(W, 1).
6. Now, sum is called with to = 1, and keta is '4' (from the updated W array).
7. Since keta is less than 5, it returns keta + sum(N, to-1), which is 4 + sum(W, 0).
8. Finally, sum is called with to = 0, and keta is '0'.
9. Since keta is less than 5, it returns keta, which is 0.

The final calculation is (10 - 6) + 4 + 0, which is 4 + 4 + 0, equal to 8.

Therefore, the output of the code execution is 8.
