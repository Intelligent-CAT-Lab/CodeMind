<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main class `Main` that implements `Runnable` and contains a `main` method that starts a new thread with the `Main` class itself as the runnable target. The `run` method of the `Main` class creates an instance of `Main`, initializes `ContestScanner` and `Writer` objects for input and output, respectively, calls the `solve` method, and then closes the output and input streams.

The `solve` method reads two long integers `x` and `y` from the input, which are 2 and 1 in this case. It then calculates `tx` as `x - Math.min(x, y)` which results in `2 - 1 = 1`, and `ty` as `y - Math.min(x, y)` which results in `1 - 1 = 0`. The condition `(tx + ty <= 1)` is then checked, which in this case is `1 + 0 <= 1`, which is true. Therefore, the output printed is "Brown".

The `ContestScanner` class is a helper class for reading input, and the `Writer` class is a helper class for writing output. In this case, the `Writer` class is not used for any output operations other than closing the stream.
