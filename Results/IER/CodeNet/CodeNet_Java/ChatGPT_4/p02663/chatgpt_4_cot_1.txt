<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate the difference in minutes between two times and then subtract a given number of minutes (k) from that difference.

The input provided is `10 0 15 0 30`, which corresponds to the start time (h1:m1) of 10:00 and the end time (h2:m2) of 15:00, with k being 30 minutes.

The code reads the input using a Scanner object and the nextInt method, which parses the next token of the input as an integer. The variables h1, m1, h2, m2, and k are initialized with the values 10, 0, 15, 0, and 30, respectively.

The variable h is calculated as the difference in hours between h2 and h1, which is 15 - 10 = 5 hours.
The variable m is calculated as the difference in minutes between m2 and m1, which is 0 - 0 = 0 minutes.
The variable day is calculated as the total difference in minutes, which is (5 * 60) + 0 = 300 minutes.

Finally, the code prints the result of subtracting k from day, which is 300 - 30 = 270 minutes.

<<<Output>>>
270
