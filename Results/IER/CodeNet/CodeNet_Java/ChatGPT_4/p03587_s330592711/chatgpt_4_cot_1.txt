<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string S from the input, which is "111100". It initializes an integer variable ans with 0. Then it enters a for loop that iterates over the indices of the string S from 0 to 5 (inclusive).

Inside the loop, it takes each character of the string S, converts it to its corresponding integer value by subtracting the character '0' from it, and adds this value to the variable ans. This is done for each character in the string "111100".

The loop performs the following operations:
- ans += '1' - '0' (three times for the first three characters '1')
- ans += '0' - '0' (three times for the last three characters '0')

The sum of the digits is calculated as follows:
- ans = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0
- ans = 3

After the loop finishes, the final value of ans, which is 3, is printed as the output.
