<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "BACD". The main method of the Main class uses a FastScanner object to read the next token from the input, which is the entire string "BACD".

The for loop iterates over the characters of the string starting from index 1 to the end of the string. It checks if the character at the current index (i) and the character before it (i-1) are 'A' and 'C' respectively.

The loop checks the following pairs of characters:
- At i=1, it checks characters at index 0 and 1, which are 'B' and 'A'. The condition is not met.
- At i=2, it checks characters at index 1 and 2, which are 'A' and 'C'. The condition is met.

Since the condition is met at i=2, the program prints "Yes" and returns, ending the execution.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
