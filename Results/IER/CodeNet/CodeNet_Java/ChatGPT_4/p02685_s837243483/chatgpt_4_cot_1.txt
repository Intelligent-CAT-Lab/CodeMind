<<<Analysis>>>
The input values are n=3, m=2, and k=1. The variable limit is set to 998244353.

The code calculates the number of ways to paint a sequence of n elements with m colors such that no more than k adjacent elements have the same color.

First, the code initializes two arrays, nextPattern and colorPattern, with a size of k+1.

The variable pattern is used to calculate the number of color patterns for sequences where adjacent elements are not the same color. Since k < n-1, the for loop runs once with i=0, setting pattern to m (2 in this case).

Next, the code calculates the number of combinations where exactly i adjacent elements are the same color. This is done in a for loop that iterates from 0 to k.

For i=0, nextPattern[0] is set to 1, and colorPattern[k] is set to (pattern * (m - 1)) % limit, which is (2 * (2 - 1)) % 998244353 = 2 % 998244353 = 2.

For i=1, nextPattern[1] is calculated using the modular inverse. The modular inverse of 1 mod 998244353 is 1, so nextPattern[1] = ((1 * (3 - 1)) % 998244353) * 1 % 998244353 = 2 % 998244353 = 2. colorPattern[k - i] is set to (colorPattern[k - i + 1] * (m - 1)) % limit, which is (2 * (2 - 1)) % 998244353 = 2 % 998244353 = 2.

Finally, the code calculates the total number of valid color patterns by summing up the products of nextPattern[i] and colorPattern[i] for all i from 0 to k. This is done in a for loop that iterates from 0 to k.

countPattern = (0 + (1 * 2) % 998244353) % 998244353 = (0 + 2) % 998244353 = 2 % 998244353 = 2
countPattern = (2 + (2 * 2) % 998244353) % 998244353 = (2 + 4) % 998244353 = 6 % 998244353 = 6

The final value of countPattern is 6, which is the output of the program.
