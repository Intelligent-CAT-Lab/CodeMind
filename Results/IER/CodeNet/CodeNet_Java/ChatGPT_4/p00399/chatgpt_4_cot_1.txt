<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings based on spaces. The input `4 2 1 1` is split into the array `{"4", "2", "1", "1"}`. The variable `result` is initialized with 0.

It then enters a for loop that iterates over the length of the array `numDog`. For each iteration, it converts the current string element to an integer using `Integer.parseInt` and adds it to the `result`.

The loop processes the elements of the array as follows:
- First iteration: `result` becomes 0 + 4 = 4
- Second iteration: `result` becomes 4 + 2 = 6
- Third iteration: `result` becomes 6 + 1 = 7
- Fourth iteration: `result` becomes 7 + 1 = 8

After the loop finishes, the final value of `result` is 8, which is then printed to the console.

<<<Output>>>
8
