<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads a single word from the input and assigns it to the variable `str`.

The input provided is "Sunny". The code then checks if `str` is equal to "Sunny", "Cloudy", or "Rainy" using three separate if statements.

Since `str` is "Sunny", the first if condition is true, and the code inside this if block is executed, printing "Cloudy" to the console.

The other two if conditions are not checked because there are no else or else if statements connected to the first if statement. Therefore, the program does not print anything else and finishes execution after printing "Cloudy".

<<<Output>>>
Cloudy
