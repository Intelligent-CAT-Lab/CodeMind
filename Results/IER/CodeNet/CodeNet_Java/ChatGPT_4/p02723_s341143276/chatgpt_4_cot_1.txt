<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads a string S from the input, which is "sippuu" in this case.

The if statement checks if the character at index 2 is the same as the character at index 3, and if the character at index 4 is the same as the character at index 5 in the string S.

For the input "sippuu":
- S.charAt(2) is 'p'
- S.charAt(3) is 'p'
- S.charAt(4) is 'u'
- S.charAt(5) is 'u'

Since 'p' is equal to 'p' and 'u' is equal to 'u', the condition of the if statement is true.

Therefore, the code will print "Yes" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
