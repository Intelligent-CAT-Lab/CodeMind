The input provided is `4 4`, which means x and y are both set to 4.0. The variable a is calculated as y / (2 * x), which is 4.0 / (2 * 4.0) = 0.5.

A List of `point` objects named `cx` is created to store points.

The first for loop iterates from i = 0 to i = x (inclusive), which means it will iterate 5 times (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). In each iteration, it creates a new `point` object `p` and sets its x value to i * 2 and its y value to y - (a * p.x). The calculated points will be:
- i = 0: p.x = 0, p.y = 4 - (0.5 * 0) = 4
- i = 1: p.x = 2, p.y = 4 - (0.5 * 2) = 3
- i = 2: p.x = 4, p.y = 4 - (0.5 * 4) = 2
- i = 3: p.x = 6, p.y = 4 - (0.5 * 6) = 1
- i = 4: p.x = 8, p.y = 4 - (0.5 * 8) = 0

These points are added to the `cx` list.

The second for loop iterates from i = 0 to i = y (inclusive), which means it will iterate 5 times (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). In each iteration, it creates a new `point` object `p` and sets its y value to i and its x value to (y - p.y) / a. The calculated points will be:
- i = 0: p.y = 0, p.x = (4 - 0) / 0.5 = 8 (This point is already in the list, so it's not added again)
- i = 1: p.y = 1, p.x = (4 - 1) / 0.5 = 6 (This point is already in the list, so it's not added again)
- i = 2: p.y = 2, p.x = (4 - 2) / 0.5 = 4 (This point is already in the list, so it's not added again)
- i = 3: p.y = 3, p.x = (4 - 3) / 0.5 = 2 (This point is already in the list, so it's not added again)
- i = 4: p.y = 4, p.x = (4 - 4) / 0.5 = 0 (This point is already in the list, so it's not added again)

No new points are added to the list in the second loop because all the points calculated were already present in the list from the first loop.

Finally, the program prints the size of the `cx` list, which contains 5 points.
