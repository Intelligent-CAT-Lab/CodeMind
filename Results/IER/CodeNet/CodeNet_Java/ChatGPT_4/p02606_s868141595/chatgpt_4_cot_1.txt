<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `main` method and a nested `FastScanner` class to read input efficiently. The `main` method reads three integers `l`, `r`, and `d` using the `FastScanner` class.

Given the input `5 10 2`, the variables are initialized as follows:
- `l` is set to 5
- `r` is set to 10
- `d` is set to 2

The code then calculates the number of integers divisible by `d` between `l` and `r` (inclusive). This is done by the expression `(r/d) - (l-1)/d`.

Breaking down the calculation:
- `r/d` calculates how many numbers are divisible by `d` from 1 up to `r`. Since `r` is 10 and `d` is 2, `r/d` is `10/2` which equals 5.
- `(l-1)/d` calculates how many numbers are divisible by `d` from 1 up to `l-1`. Since `l` is 5, `l-1` is 4. So `(l-1)/d` is `4/2` which equals 2.

Subtracting the two gives us `5 - 2`, which equals 3. This means there are 3 numbers between 5 and 10 (inclusive) that are divisible by 2.
