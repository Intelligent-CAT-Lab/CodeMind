<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, A, B, C, and D are initialized with 5, 1, 5, 2, and 4 respectively according to the input.

The program enters a for loop that iterates from i = 0 to i = N - 1 (i.e., 4 in this case).

In each iteration, it calculates two values: max and min. The max value is calculated as D * (N - 1 - i) - C * i, and the min value is calculated as C * (N - 1 - i) - D * i.

The program then checks if the absolute difference between B and A (which is |5 - 1| = 4) is greater than or equal to min and less than or equal to max.

The loop will run for i = 0 to i = 4, and in each iteration, the following values will be calculated:

For i = 0:
max = D * (N - 1 - i) - C * i = 4 * (5 - 1 - 0) - 2 * 0 = 16
min = C * (N - 1 - i) - D * i = 2 * (5 - 1 - 0) - 4 * 0 = 8
Since 4 is not between 8 and 16, the condition is not met.

For i = 1:
max = D * (N - 1 - i) - C * i = 4 * (5 - 1 - 1) - 2 * 1 = 12
min = C * (N - 1 - i) - D * i = 2 * (5 - 1 - 1) - 4 * 1 = 4
Since 4 is between 4 and 12, the condition is met.

As soon as the condition is met, the program prints "YES" and returns, ending the execution.

Therefore, the output will be "YES" because the condition is satisfied in the second iteration of the loop when i = 1.
