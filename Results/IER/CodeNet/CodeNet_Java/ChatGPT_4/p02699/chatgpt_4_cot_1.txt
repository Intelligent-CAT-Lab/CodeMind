<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `solve` method that is called from the `main` method. The `solve` method reads two integers `s` and `w` using the `FastScanner` class, which is a custom scanner implementation to read input from `System.in`.

The input provided is `4 5`. The `solve` method reads these values into `s` and `w` respectively, so `s = 4` and `w = 5`.

The `solve` method then checks if `w` is greater than or equal to `s`. Since `w` is 5 and `s` is 4, the condition `w >= s` is true.

As a result, the program prints "unsafe" to the standard output.

The rest of the code defines various mathematical functions and a custom `Pair` class, but these are not used in the `solve` method for the given input.
