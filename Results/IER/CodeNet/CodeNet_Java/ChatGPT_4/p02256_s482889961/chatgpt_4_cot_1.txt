The input provided is `54 20`. The main method reads these two integers and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. Since `a` is greater than `b`, the `calcu` method is called with `a` as the first argument and `b` as the second argument.

The `calcu` method implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The initial value of `ans` is set to `a`, which is `54`. The while loop continues as long as `b` is not equal to `0`.

Here is the step-by-step execution of the while loop:
1. `ans = 54 % 20` which is `14`, `a` becomes `20`, `b` becomes `14`.
2. `ans = 20 % 14` which is `6`, `a` becomes `14`, `b` becomes `6`.
3. `ans = 14 % 6` which is `2`, `a` becomes `6`, `b` becomes `2`.
4. `ans = 6 % 2` which is `0`, `a` becomes `2`, `b` becomes `0`.

The loop stops because `b` is now `0`. The method prints the current value of `a`, which is `2`. This is the GCD of `54` and `20`.
