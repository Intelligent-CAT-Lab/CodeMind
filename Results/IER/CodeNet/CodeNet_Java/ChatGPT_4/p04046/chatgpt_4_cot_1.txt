<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 3 1 1` initializes the variables h, w, a, and b with the values 2, 3, 1, and 1 respectively.

The `ModComb` class is instantiated with a size of 200005, and the `makeFac` method is called to initialize the factorial (`fac`) and inverse factorial (`inv`) arrays.

The `solve` method of the `ABC042DIrohaandaGrid` class calculates a `ModInt` result (`res`) by iterating from 0 to `h - a` (which is 1 in this case). Inside the loop, for each i (0 and 1), it calculates a combination of paths from the top left to a point on the right edge of the forbidden zone (b - 1 + i choose i) and multiplies it by the combination of paths from that point to the bottom right (w - b - 1 + h - 1 - i choose h - 1 - i). The result of these multiplications is added to `res`.

The combinations are calculated using the `combFac` method, which uses the precomputed factorials and inverse factorials.

The loop runs twice with the following values:
- For i = 0: combFac(1, 0) * combFac(3, 1) = 1 * 3 = 3
- For i = 1: combFac(2, 1) * combFac(2, 1) = 2 * 2 = 4

The `ModInt` class ensures that all operations are done modulo 1000000007.

The final result is the sum of the two iterations: 3 + 4 = 7.

The `out.println(res.toString())` call prints the result as a string, which is "7".
