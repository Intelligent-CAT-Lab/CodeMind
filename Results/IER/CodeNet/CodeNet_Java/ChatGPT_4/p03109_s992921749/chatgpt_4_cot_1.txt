<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single string input which is expected to be a date in the format "YYYY/MM/DD". The input string is then split into an array of strings using the "/" delimiter. The month and day are extracted by parsing the second and third elements of the array into integers.

The variable `mon` is assigned the value of the month, and `day` is assigned the value of the day, but `day` is not used in the subsequent code.

The code then uses a ternary operator to determine the value of the string `ans`. If the month (`mon`) is less than or equal to 4, `ans` is set to "Heisei". Otherwise, `ans` is set to "TBD".

Given the input `2019/04/30`, the month is 4, which is less than or equal to 4, so the ternary operator will set `ans` to "Heisei".

Finally, the program prints the value of `ans`.
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
