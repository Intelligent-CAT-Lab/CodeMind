<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is initialized with "010". The length of S is 3, which is greater than 1, so the program does not return 1 immediately.

The program enters a for loop with the variable border starting from 1 and going up to the length of S, which is 3. It compares the characters at positions border-1 and border in the string S.

In the first iteration, border is 1, prev is '0' and post is '1'. Since prev is not equal to post, the program calls the moreMid function with border (1) and mid (-1).

Inside moreMid, since mid is -1, it calls the mid function with border (1). The mid function calculates bm as (3+1)/2 which is 2. Since border (1) is less than bm (2), the mid function returns border, which is 1.

The moreMid function then returns 1, and mid is updated to 1.

In the second iteration, border is 2, prev is '1' and post is '0'. Since prev is not equal to post, the program calls the moreMid function with border (2) and mid (1).

Inside moreMid, it calls the mid function with border (2). The mid function calculates bm as (3+1)/2 which is 2. Since border (2) is not less than bm (2), the mid function returns S.length() - border, which is 3 - 2 = 1.

The moreMid function then compares the new mid value (1) with the current mid (1) and returns the maximum, which is still 1.

Since there are no more iterations, the program checks if mid is -1. It is not, so it returns S.length() - mid, which is 3 - 1 = 2.
