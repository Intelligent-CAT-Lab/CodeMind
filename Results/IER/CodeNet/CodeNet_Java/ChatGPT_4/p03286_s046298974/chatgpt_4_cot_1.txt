<<<Analysis>>>
The input `-9` is read and stored in the variable `s`. The variable `N` is initialized with the value `-9`. A `StringBuilder` object `sb` is created to build the output string.

The variable `base` is set to `2`, which indicates that the conversion will be to base `-2`.

The `while` loop will continue to execute as long as `N` is not `0`. Inside the loop, the following steps occur:

1. The remainder of `N` divided by `base` (`-9 % 2`) is `-1`. The absolute value of `-1` is `1`, which is inserted at the beginning of `sb`.
2. `N` is decremented by the absolute value of the remainder, so `N` becomes `-9 - 1 = -10`.
3. `N` is then divided by `-base`, so `N` becomes `-10 / -2 = 5`.

The loop continues with `N` now being `5`:

1. The remainder of `N` divided by `base` (`5 % 2`) is `1`. The absolute value of `1` is `1`, which is inserted at the beginning of `sb`.
2. `N` is decremented by the absolute value of the remainder, so `N` becomes `5 - 1 = 4`.
3. `N` is then divided by `-base`, so `N` becomes `4 / -2 = -2`.

The loop continues with `N` now being `-2`:

1. The remainder of `N` divided by `base` (`-2 % 2`) is `0`. The absolute value of `0` is `0`, which is inserted at the beginning of `sb`.
2. `N` is decremented by the absolute value of the remainder, so `N` remains `-2`.
3. `N` is then divided by `-base`, so `N` becomes `-2 / -2 = 1`.

The loop continues with `N` now being `1`:

1. The remainder of `N` divided by `base` (`1 % 2`) is `1`. The absolute value of `1` is `1`, which is inserted at the beginning of `sb`.
2. `N` is decremented by the absolute value of the remainder, so `N` becomes `1 - 1 = 0`.
3. `N` is then divided by `-base`, but since `N` is now `0`, the loop will terminate.

The `StringBuilder` `sb` now contains the string `"1101"`, which is the base `-2` representation of the decimal number `-9`.

Finally, the program checks if `sb` is empty, and since it's not, it prints the contents of `sb`.
