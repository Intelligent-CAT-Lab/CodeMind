<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer N from the input, which in this case is 5.

The next line of code calculates the result of the expression `(N + 1) / 2`. Since N is 5, the expression becomes `(5 + 1) / 2`, which simplifies to `6 / 2`. The division of two integers in Java results in an integer value, so the result is `3`.

The result `3` is then printed to the standard output using `System.out.printf("%d", result)`. The `%d` is a format specifier for decimal integers.

Finally, the Scanner object is closed with `sc.close()`, and the program returns from the main method.
