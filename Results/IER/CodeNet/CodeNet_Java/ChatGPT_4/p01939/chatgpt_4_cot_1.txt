The input provided is `3 9`, which means `first_N` is assigned the value 3 and `first_M` is assigned the value 9.

The code first checks if `first_N` is equal to 1, which it is not, so it skips the first if block.

Next, it calculates `first_limit` based on the values of `first_N` and `first_M`. Since `(first_M+1) % (first_N-1)` is equal to `(9+1) % (3-1)` which is `10 % 2`, which equals 0, `first_limit` is calculated as `(first_M+1) / (first_N-1) - 1`, which is `(9+1) / (3-1) - 1` which equals `10 / 2 - 1`, which is `5 - 1`, which equals 4.

Since `first_limit` is greater than 0, the code proceeds to the else block.

Inside the else block, it uses `BigInteger` to handle large integer calculations. It calculates the following:

- `A` is assigned the value of `first_M+1`, which is `9+1`, which equals 10.
- `B` is assigned the value of `2 * (first_M+1) * limit`, which is `2 * 10 * 4`, which equals 80.
- `C` is assigned the value of `(first_N-1) * limit * (limit+1)`, which is `(3-1) * 4 * (4+1)`, which is `2 * 4 * 5`, which equals 40.

The final calculation is `A + B - C`, which is `10 + 80 - 40`, which equals 50.

The result is then taken modulo `MOD`, which is `50 % 1000000007`, which is still 50 since 50 is much smaller than 1000000007.

Therefore, the output of the code will be 50.
