<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main class with a main method that creates an instance of the Main class and calls its run method. The run method uses a Scanner class, which is a nested class within Main, to read an integer N from the input.

The Scanner class is designed to read bytes from the input stream and convert them into different data types like int, long, double, etc. It has methods to check if there are more bytes to read, to read a byte, to check if a byte corresponds to a printable character, and to read the next token as a string, integer, or long.

In the run method, after reading the integer N, there is a check to see if N is equal to 1. If it is, the program prints 1 and returns.

If N is not 1, the program enters a while loop where it calculates a value c. The loop continues doubling c until 2 * c - 1 is greater than N. Once the loop exits, c is decremented by 1.

The program then prints the number of 1-bits in the binary representation of c using the Long.bitCount method. This is done by creating a PrintWriter object for output and then closing it after printing the result.

Given the input `2`, the following steps occur:
1. N is read as 2.
2. The if condition to check if N is 1 is false.
3. The while loop starts with c initialized to 1.
4. The condition 2 * c - 1 <= N is true (2 * 1 - 1 = 1 <= 2), so c is doubled to 2.
5. The loop condition is checked again, and this time it is false (2 * 2 - 1 = 3 > 2), so the loop exits.
6. c is decremented by 1, resulting in c = 1.
7. The number of 1-bits in the binary representation of c (which is 1) is calculated using Long.bitCount(c), which is also 1.
8. The result 1 is printed.
