<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable n.

The value of n is checked against the value 1. Since the input provided is `1`, the condition (n == 1) evaluates to true.

As a result, the code inside the if block is executed, which prints "Hello World" to the standard output.

The else block is ignored because the if condition was true.

Finally, the Scanner object is closed using fs.close().

<<<Output>>>
Hello World
