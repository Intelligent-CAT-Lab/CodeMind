<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value from the input and stores it in the variable N. The input provided is `2`, so N is set to 2. The code then calculates the square of N by multiplying N by itself (N * N) and prints the result. Since N is 2, the output will be 2 * 2, which equals 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
