The variable N is initialized with 4 according to the input. The variables res and sum are initialized with 1.
The while loop runs as long as sum is less than or equal to N. The loop checks if sum is equal to N, and if so, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it increments res by 1 and adds the new res value to sum. The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: res = 1, sum = 1 (sum is less than N, so continue)
- Second iteration: res = 2, sum = 1 + 2 = 3 (sum is less than N, so continue)
- Third iteration: res = 3, sum = 3 + 3 = 6 (sum is now greater than N, so exit the loop)

Since sum (6) is greater than N (4), the code subtracts the last res value (3) from sum, resulting in sum = 6 - 3 = 3, and decrements res to res = 3 - 1 = 2.

An array ans of size res+1 (which is 3) is created to store the sequence of integers. The for loop initializes the array with consecutive integers from 1 to res (1, 2).

The variable len is calculated as N - sum, which is 4 - 3 = 1. The next for loop is supposed to increment the last len elements of the ans array by 1. However, there is a mistake in the loop condition. The loop is written as `for(int j=res;j>=res+1-len;j--)` which should be `for(int j=res;j>res-len;j--)` to work correctly. With the current condition, the loop will not execute because res is not greater than or equal to res+1-len when len is 1.

Therefore, the ans array remains unchanged with values [1, 2].

The PrintWriter then prints the elements of the ans array starting from index 1 to res (inclusive), which are 1 and 2.
