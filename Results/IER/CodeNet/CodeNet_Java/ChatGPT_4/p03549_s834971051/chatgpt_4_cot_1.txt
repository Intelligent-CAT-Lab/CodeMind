<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main class with a main method and a FastScanner class for reading input. The main method creates an instance of FastScanner and reads two integers, N and M, from the input. In this case, N is 1 and M is 1.

The main method then calculates the value of 's' using the formula:
s = (100 * (N - M) + 1900 * M) * (int) Math.pow(2, M)

Substituting the values of N and M, we get:
s = (100 * (1 - 1) + 1900 * 1) * (int) Math.pow(2, 1)
s = (100 * 0 + 1900 * 1) * (int) Math.pow(2, 1)
s = (0 + 1900) * (int) Math.pow(2, 1)
s = 1900 * (int) Math.pow(2, 1)
s = 1900 * 2
s = 3800

Finally, the code prints the value of 's', which is 3800.
