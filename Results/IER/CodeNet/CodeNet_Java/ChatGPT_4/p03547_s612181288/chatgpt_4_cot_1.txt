<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a static `IO` class inside it. The `IO` class is used to handle input and output operations. The `main` method creates an instance of `IO` and reads two characters, `A` and `B`, from the input.

The input provided is `A B`. The `IO` class reads the first character 'A' and assigns it to the variable `A`. Then it reads the second character 'B' and assigns it to the variable `B`.

The `main` method then compares the two characters using if-else statements. If `A` is less than `B`, it prints "<". If `A` is greater than `B`, it prints ">". If `A` is equal to `B`, it prints "=".

Since 'A' is less than 'B' in the ASCII table (ASCII value of 'A' is 65 and 'B' is 66), the condition `A<B` is true, and the program will print "<".
