<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and X are initialized with 2, 2, and 4 respectively according to the input. The variable d is declared but not initialized.

The if condition checks if X * 2 is greater than or equal to A * A * B. In this case, 4 * 2 is not greater than or equal to 2 * 2 * 2, so the else block is executed.

In the else block, the variable z is calculated as (double) (X) / A / B * 2, which is (double) (4) / 2 / 2 * 2, which simplifies to 2.0.

Then, d is calculated as Math.atan(B / z) * 180 / Math.PI, which is Math.atan(2 / 2.0) * 180 / Math.PI, which simplifies to Math.atan(1) * 180 / Math.PI.

Math.atan(1) is the arctangent of 1, which is π/4 radians (or 45 degrees). Therefore, d is calculated as (π/4) * 180 / π, which simplifies to 45 degrees.

Finally, the value of d is printed out, which is 45.0.

45.0
