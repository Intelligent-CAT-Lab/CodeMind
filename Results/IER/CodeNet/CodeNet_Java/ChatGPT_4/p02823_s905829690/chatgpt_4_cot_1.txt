<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `5 2 4`. The variables N, A, and B are initialized with 5, 2, and 4 respectively according to the input.

The `solve` method is called, which contains the logic to process the input. It checks if the difference between B and A is even by calculating `(B - A) % 2`. Since 4 - 2 = 2, and 2 % 2 = 0, the condition is true.

Since the condition is true, it calculates the output by dividing the difference by 2: `(B - A) / 2`. This results in `(4 - 2) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1`.

The result is then printed out using `out.println`. The output will be `1`.
