The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input. The variable money is initialized with 100000.
It enters a for loop and it iterates 5 times because n is 5. Inside the for loop, the following operations occur in each iteration:

1. money is multiplied by 1.05 (5% increase).
2. If money is not a multiple of 1000, it is rounded up to the nearest 1000.

Let's calculate the value of money after each iteration:
- After 1st iteration: money = 100000 * 1.05 = 105000 (no rounding needed as it's a multiple of 1000).
- After 2nd iteration: money = 105000 * 1.05 = 110250, rounded up to 111000.
- After 3rd iteration: money = 111000 * 1.05 = 116550, rounded up to 117000.
- After 4th iteration: money = 117000 * 1.05 = 122850, rounded up to 123000.
- After 5th iteration: money = 123000 * 1.05 = 129150, rounded up to 130000.

After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of money as output, which is 130000.
