The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. An array x of size 1001 is created to store the count of prime factors for each number from 2 to n. The variable sum is initialized with 1.

The code enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to n (which is 3 in this case). For each iteration, it initializes a temporary variable t with the current value of i.

Inside the nested for loop, it iterates from 2 to i. For each iteration, it checks if t is divisible by j. If it is, it increments the count of prime factor j in the array x and divides t by j. This process continues until t is no longer divisible by j.

For i = 2, the inner loop runs and finds that 2 is a prime factor of 2, so it increments x[2] by 1.
For i = 3, the inner loop runs and finds that 3 is a prime factor of 3, so it increments x[3] by 1.

After the for loops, the code initializes a long variable e with the value 1e9+7 (which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations to avoid overflow).

The code then enters another for loop to iterate over the array x. For each non-zero value in x, it multiplies sum by (x[i]+1) and takes the modulo e. This is because the number of divisors of a number is the product of (exponent+1) for each prime factor in its prime factorization.

For x[2], which is 1, sum becomes sum * (1+1) = 2.
For x[3], which is 1, sum becomes sum * (1+1) = 4.

Finally, the code prints the value of sum, which is 4 after the modulo operation.
