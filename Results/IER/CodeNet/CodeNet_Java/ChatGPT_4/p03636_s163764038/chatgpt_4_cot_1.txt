<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "internationalization" is read and stored in the variable str. The length of the string is calculated and stored in the variable n, which is 20 for this input.
The first character of the string is stored in the variable h, which is 'i'.
The last character of the string is stored in the variable t, which is 'n'.
The program then prints the first character, followed by the number of characters between the first and last character (n-2), and then the last character. For the input "internationalization", n-2 is 18.
Therefore, the output will be the first character 'i', followed by "18", followed by the last character 'n'.
