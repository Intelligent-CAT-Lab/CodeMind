<<<Analysis>>>
The code represents a simulation of a Rubik's Cube rotation. The `map` array represents the unfolded Rubik's Cube with each cell containing a character that represents a color. The `solve` method reads a string of commands and performs rotations on the cube according to the commands given. Each command corresponds to a rotation of a face of the cube or a row/column of the cube.

The input is a single character `R`, which corresponds to a rotation of the right face of the cube. The code will perform the following steps:

1. The `R` command is detected by checking the ASCII code of the character at index `i` in the input string.
2. The `R` command will cause the right column (index 3) to shift upwards, and the top and bottom rows (index 0 and 5) to rotate accordingly.
3. The `rotate90` method is called with parameters `(2,4)`, which rotates the 2x2 section at the coordinates (2,4) clockwise.

The initial state of the cube is:
```
..rr....
..rr....
ggyybbww
ggyybbww
..oo....
..oo....
```

After the `R` command is executed, the state of the cube should be:
```
..rw....
..rw....
ggyybbwo
ggyybbwo
..oo....
..oo....
```

The right column (index 3) has been shifted upwards, with the `w` from the bottom moving to the top, and the `r` from the top moving to the bottom right (index 6) of the middle section. The `rotate90` method rotates the 2x2 section at (2,4) clockwise, which results in the `b` and `w` colors swapping places in that section.

<<<Output>>>
..rw....
..rw....
ggyyowbw
ggyybwwo
..oo....
..oo....
