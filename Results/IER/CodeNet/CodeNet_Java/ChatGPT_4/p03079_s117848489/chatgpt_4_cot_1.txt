<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads three integers a, b, and c from the input, which are 2, 2, and 2 respectively according to the given input.

The if statement checks whether all three integers are equal. Since a equals b and a also equals c, the condition (a == b) && (a == c) evaluates to true.

Because the condition is true, the code inside the if block is executed, which prints "Yes" to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
