<<<Analysis>>>
The input "2 5 4" is read and split into an array of strings ["2", "5", "4"]. These strings are then parsed into integers and stored in the array `array` as [2, 5, 4].

The array is then sorted, resulting in [2, 4, 5].

Next, the code transforms the array by subtracting each element from the last element (which is the largest due to sorting). The transformed array becomes [3, 1, 0].

The code then checks various conditions to determine the value of `answer`.

Since `array[0] + array[1]` is not equal to 0, the first condition is skipped.

The second condition checks if all elements are different and if they are not, it checks if `array[0]` and `array[1]` are both even. Since `array[0]` is 3 and `array[1]` is 1, they are not both even, so the code checks the next conditions.

The code then checks if `array[0]` is even, which it is not, so it skips to the next condition.

The code then checks if `array[1]` is even, which it is, so it enters this block. It increments `answer` by 1, making it 1. Then it decrements `array[1]` by 1, making it 0. Next, it adds `array[0]/2 + 1` to `answer`, which is 3/2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Then it adds `array[1]/2 + 1` to `answer`, which is 0/2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1.

Adding these to `answer` gives 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

The other conditions are not checked because they do not match the current state of the array.

Finally, the code prints the value of `answer`, which is 4.
