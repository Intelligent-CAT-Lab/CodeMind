The input provided is `2 2 1`. The main method starts a new thread with the TaskAdapter runnable and waits for it to finish.

The TaskAdapter's run method creates instances of FastInput and FastOutput to handle input and output, respectively. It then creates an instance of FDISCOSMOS and calls its solve method with testNumber 1.

Inside the solve method of FDISCOSMOS, the input values are read as h=2, w=2, and t=1.

The gcd (greatest common divisor) of h and t is calculated, which is gcd(2, 1) = 1. Similarly, the gcd of w and t is also 1. Therefore, hh = h / gcd(h, t) = 2 / 1 = 2 and ww = w / gcd(w, t) = 2 / 1 = 2.

A new Modular object is created with the modulus 1e9 + 7 (which is a large prime number often used for modular arithmetic in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow).

The Power object is created to compute powers under the given modulus.

The variable way is initialized to 1 and then updated as follows:
- way = way + (2^hh - 2) mod (1e9 + 7)
- way = way + (2^ww - 2) mod (1e9 + 7)
- way = way + 2^gcd(hh, ww) mod (1e9 + 7)

Since hh and ww are both 2, and gcd(hh, ww) is also 2, the calculations become:
- way = 1 + (2^2 - 2) = 1 + (4 - 2) = 3
- way = 3 + (2^2 - 2) = 3 + (4 - 2) = 5
- way = 5 + 2^2 = 5 + 4 = 9

The variable p is calculated as (h / hh) * (w / ww) = (2 / 2) * (2 / 2) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Finally, way is updated to 2^way^p mod (1e9 + 7), which is 2^9^1 mod (1e9 + 7). Since p is 1, this simplifies to 2^9 mod (1e9 + 7).

2^9 is 512, so the final result is 512 mod (1e9 + 7), which is simply 512 because 512 is much less than 1e9 + 7.

The result 512 is printed to the output.
