<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four integers from the input and stores them in an array `arr`. It also calculates the total sum of these integers.

Given the input `2 1 3 4`, the array `arr` will be [2, 1, 3, 4] and the total sum `total` will be 10.

The code then initializes a variable `min` with the maximum value an integer can have.

It enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to 3 (inclusive) to find the minimum absolute difference between the total sum and double the sum of the first element and the current element.

For i = 1:
- The sum of the first element and the current element is `arr[0] + arr[1]` which is `2 + 1` = 3.
- Doubling this sum gives `3 * 2` = 6.
- The absolute difference between the total sum and this doubled sum is `|10 - 6|` = 4.
- `min` is updated to the minimum of `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and 4, which is 4.

For i = 2:
- The sum of the first element and the current element is `arr[0] + arr[2]` which is `2 + 3` = 5.
- Doubling this sum gives `5 * 2` = 10.
- The absolute difference between the total sum and this doubled sum is `|10 - 10|` = 0.
- `min` is updated to the minimum of 4 and 0, which is 0.

For i = 3:
- The sum of the first element and the current element is `arr[0] + arr[3]` which is `2 + 4` = 6.
- Doubling this sum gives `6 * 2` = 12.
- The absolute difference between the total sum and this doubled sum is `|10 - 12|` = 2.
- `min` is updated to the minimum of 0 and 2, which is still 0.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `min`, which is 0.
