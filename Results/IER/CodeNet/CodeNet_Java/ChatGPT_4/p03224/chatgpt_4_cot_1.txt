The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input. The variable l is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates until l is less than N. In each iteration, it subtracts l from N and increments l by 1.
In the first iteration, l is 1, so N becomes 3 - 1 = 2, and l becomes 2.
In the second iteration, l is 2, so N becomes 2 - 2 = 0, and l becomes 3.
The loop exits because l is now equal to N, which is 3.

The next if condition checks if N is not equal to l. Since N is equal to l, the condition is false, and the program does not print "No" but continues to the next line.

The program prints "Yes" and then prints the value of l+1, which is 4.

Next, it initializes a 2D array answer with dimensions [l+1][l], which is [4][3].

The variable Index is initialized with 1.

It enters a nested for loop to populate the 2D array answer and to print the values. The outer loop runs from i=0 to i<=l (i.e., 4 times), and the inner loop runs from j=0 to j<l (i.e., 3 times).

For i=0, it prints "3" (the value of l) and then fills the array answer[0][0], answer[0][1], and answer[0][2] with the values 1, 2, and 3, respectively, incrementing Index each time.

For i=1, it prints "3 1" (the value of l and the previously filled value answer[0][0]), and then fills the array answer[1][1] and answer[1][2] with the values 4 and 5, respectively.

For i=2, it prints "3 2 4" (the value of l and the previously filled values answer[0][1] and answer[1][1]), and then fills the array answer[2][2] with the value 6.

For i=3, it prints "3 3 5 6" (the value of l and the previously filled values answer[0][2], answer[1][2], and answer[2][2]).

Finally, it flushes the output and returns.
