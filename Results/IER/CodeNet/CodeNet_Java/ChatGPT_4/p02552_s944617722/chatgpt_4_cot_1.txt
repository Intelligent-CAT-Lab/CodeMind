<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then declares several variables, but only the variable 'n' is used in this code snippet.

The input '1' is read and assigned to the variable 'n'. The code then checks if 'n' is equal to 1. Since 'n' is indeed 1, the condition of the if statement is true, and the code inside the if block is executed.

The if block contains a single print statement that prints "0" to the standard output. Therefore, the output of the code will be "0".

The else block is ignored in this case because the condition for the if statement was true.

<<<Output>>>
0
