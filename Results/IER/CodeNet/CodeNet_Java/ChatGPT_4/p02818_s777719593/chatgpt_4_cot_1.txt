<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and k are initialized with 2, 3, and 3 respectively according to the input.
The if condition checks if k (3) is greater than or equal to a (2), which is true.
Since the condition is true, the code inside the if block is executed:
- b is updated to b - (k - a), which is 3 - (3 - 2) = 3 - 1 = 2.
- a is set to 0.
The next if condition checks if b is less than 0, which is false since b is 2.
Finally, the program prints the values of a and b, which are 0 and 2 respectively.
<<<Output>>>
0
2
