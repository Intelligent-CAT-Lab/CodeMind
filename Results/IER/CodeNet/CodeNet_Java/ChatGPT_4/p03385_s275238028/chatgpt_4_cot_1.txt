<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads a single string input and assigns it to the variable A. The input provided is "bac".

The if statement checks whether the string A contains the characters "a", "c", and "b". The method contains() is used to check for the presence of each character in the string.

Since the input string "bac" contains all three characters "a", "c", and "b", the condition of the if statement is true.

Therefore, the code will execute the first branch of the if statement and print "Yes" to the console.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
