The input is `2`, which is assigned to the variable `n`. The `solve` method is called, which calculates the answer based on the following steps:

1. `total` is calculated as 10 raised to the power of `n` modulo `mod` (1000000007). For `n = 2`, `total` is `10^2 % 1000000007 = 100`.
2. `partial` is calculated as 2 times 9 raised to the power of `n` modulo `mod`. For `n = 2`, `partial` is `2 * 9^2 % 1000000007 = 2 * 81 % 1000000007 = 162`.
3. `both` is calculated as 8 raised to the power of `n` modulo `mod`. For `n = 2`, `both` is `8^2 % 1000000007 = 64`.
4. `ans` is calculated as `(total - partial + both) % mod`. For the given values, `ans` is `(100 - 162 + 64) % 1000000007`.
5. Since the result of the subtraction could be negative, it is normalized by adding `mod` and then taking the result modulo `mod` again. So, `ans` is `((100 - 162 + 64) + 1000000007) % 1000000007`.
6. The subtraction `100 - 162` yields `-62`, and adding `64` results in `2`. Then, adding `1000000007` gives `1000000009`.
7. Taking `1000000009 % 1000000007` results in `2`.

Finally, the answer `2` is printed to the console.
