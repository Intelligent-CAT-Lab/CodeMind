<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "12" is read and stored in variable s. Variable c is initialized to 0, and variable d is initialized to the integer value of s, which is 12.
The for loop iterates over each character in the string "12". There are two characters, '1' and '2'.
For the first iteration, i = 0, s.charAt(i) is '1', which has an ASCII value of 49. Subtracting 48 from it gives 1, which is added to c, making c = 1.
For the second iteration, i = 1, s.charAt(i) is '2', which has an ASCII value of 50. Subtracting 48 from it gives 2, which is added to c, making c = 3.
After the loop, c is 3.
The if statement checks if d (which is 12) is divisible by c (which is 3). Since 12 is divisible by 3, the condition is true.
Therefore, the program prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
