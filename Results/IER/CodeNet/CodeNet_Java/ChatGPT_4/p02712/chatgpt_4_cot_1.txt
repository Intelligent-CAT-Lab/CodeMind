<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with 15 according to the input. The array list is initialized with a size of 16 (S + 1), but it is not used in the program. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The program enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to 15 (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if the current integer i is divisible by 3 or 5. If it is, the program does nothing (empty block). If it is not divisible by 3 or 5, the program adds the value of i to the variable ans.
The numbers from 1 to 15 that are not divisible by 3 or 5 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 14. The sum of these numbers is 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 13 + 14 = 60.
After the loop finishes, the program prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 60.
