<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and stores it in the variable `str`. The input is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple."

The code then performs a series of replacements on `str`:
1. It replaces all occurrences of "apple" with "temp". After this step, `str` becomes "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one temp."
2. It replaces all occurrences of "peach" with "apple". After this step, `str` becomes "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one temp."
3. It replaces all occurrences of "temp" with "peach". After this step, `str` becomes "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach."

Finally, the code prints the modified `str` to the console.

<<<Output>>>
the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.
