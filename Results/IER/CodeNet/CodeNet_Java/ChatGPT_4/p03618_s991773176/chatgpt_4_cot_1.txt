The input string `S` is initialized with "aatt". The length of `S` is 4.

The variable `ans` is calculated as the total number of substrings that can be formed from `S` plus 1. This is done using the formula `length * (length + 1) / 2 + 1`. For the input "aatt", `ans` is initially calculated as `(4 * (4 + 1) / 2) + 1`, which equals `11`.

An integer array `num` of size 26 is created to keep track of the count of each character in the string `S`. The array is initialized with all elements as 0.

The code then iterates over each character in the string `S`. For each character, it calculates the index `c` as the difference between the ASCII value of the character and the ASCII value of 'a'. This index is used to access the corresponding element in the `num` array.

For each character in `S`, the code increments the count in `num[c]` and subtracts this count from `ans`.

Let's go through the string "aatt" character by character:
- For the first 'a', `c` is 0. `num[0]` is incremented to 1. `ans` is decremented by 1 (11 - 1 = 10).
- For the second 'a', `c` is still 0. `num[0]` is incremented to 2. `ans` is decremented by 2 (10 - 2 = 8).
- For the first 't', `c` is 19. `num[19]` is incremented to 1. `ans` is decremented by 1 (8 - 1 = 7).
- For the second 't', `c` is still 19. `num[19]` is incremented to 2. `ans` is decremented by 2 (7 - 2 = 5).

After the loop finishes, the final value of `ans` is 5. This is the number of substrings that can be formed from `S` without considering the substrings that contain repeated characters.

The code then prints the value of `ans` as the output.
