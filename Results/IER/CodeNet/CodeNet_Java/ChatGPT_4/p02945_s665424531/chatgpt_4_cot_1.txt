<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with -13 and 3 respectively according to the input. The variable max is initialized with the sum of a and b, which is -13 + 3 = -10.

The code then checks if max is less than a - b, which is -13 - 3 = -16. Since -10 is not less than -16, max remains -10.

Next, the code checks if max is less than a * b, which is -13 * 3 = -39. Since -10 is greater than -39, max remains -10.

Finally, the code prints the value of max, which is -10.

<<<Output>>>
-10
