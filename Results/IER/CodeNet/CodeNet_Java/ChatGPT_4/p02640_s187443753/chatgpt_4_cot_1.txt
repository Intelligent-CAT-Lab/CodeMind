<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized with 3 and 8 respectively according to the input.
The code then checks two conditions:
1. If x multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to y (3*2 <= 8), which is true.
2. If x multiplied by 4 is greater than or equal to y (3*4 >= 8), which is also true.

Since both conditions are true, it proceeds to check if y is divisible by 2 (y % 2 == 0). Since 8 is divisible by 2, this condition is also true.

As all conditions are met, the code prints "Yes" and returns, which means the execution of the program is stopped immediately after printing "Yes" and it does not reach the last line that prints "No".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
