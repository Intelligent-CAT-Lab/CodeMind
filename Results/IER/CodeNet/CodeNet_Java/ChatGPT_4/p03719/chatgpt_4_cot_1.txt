<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads three integers a, b, and c from the input, which are assigned the values 1, 3, and 2 respectively according to the given input.

The code initializes a String variable result with the value "No". It then checks if the value of c is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b. In this case, since c (2) is greater than or equal to a (1) and less than or equal to b (3), the condition is true.

Because the condition is true, the value of result is changed to "Yes". Finally, the code prints the value of result, which is "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
