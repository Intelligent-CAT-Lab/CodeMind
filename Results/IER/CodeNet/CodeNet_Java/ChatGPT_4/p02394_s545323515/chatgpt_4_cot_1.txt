<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to determine whether a circle with radius r can fit inside a rectangle of width W and height H when the center of the circle is at coordinates (x, y). The input values are read using a Scanner object.

The input values are:
W (width of the rectangle) = 5
H (height of the rectangle) = 4
x (x-coordinate of the circle's center) = 2
y (y-coordinate of the circle's center) = 2
r (radius of the circle) = 1

The code then checks if the circle is within the bounds of the rectangle. This is done by ensuring that:
1. The left edge of the circle (x - r) is greater than or equal to 0.
2. The right edge of the circle (x + r) is less than or equal to W.
3. The top edge of the circle (y - r) is greater than or equal to 0.
4. The bottom edge of the circle (y + r) is less than or equal to H.

For the given input:
- The left edge of the circle is at x - r = 2 - 1 = 1, which is >= 0.
- The right edge of the circle is at x + r = 2 + 1 = 3, which is <= W (5).
- The top edge of the circle is at y - r = 2 - 1 = 1, which is >= 0.
- The bottom edge of the circle is at y + r = 2 + 1 = 3, which is <= H (4).

Since all these conditions are met, the circle fits within the rectangle, and the program will output "Yes".
