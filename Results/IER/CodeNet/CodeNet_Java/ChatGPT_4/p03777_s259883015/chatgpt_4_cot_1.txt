<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two strings, `a` and `b`, from the input. In this case, both `a` and `b` are assigned the value "H" based on the given input "H H".

The code then compares the two strings using the `equals` method. Since both strings are identical ("H" equals "H"), the condition in the ternary operator `a.equals(b) ? "H" : "D"` evaluates to true.

As a result, the ternary operator returns "H", and the program prints "H" to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
H
