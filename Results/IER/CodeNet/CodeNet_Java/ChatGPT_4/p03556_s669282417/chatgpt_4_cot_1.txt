<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input.
The code enters an infinite while loop and checks if the square of the integer square root of n is equal to n itself. This is a way to check if n is a perfect square.
For the input 10, the integer square root is 3 (since Math.sqrt(10) is approximately 3.162, and casting to int truncates the decimal part), and 3 * 3 is 9, which is not equal to 10. Therefore, the if condition is not satisfied.
The code then decrements n by 1, making n equal to 9.
The loop runs again, and this time the integer square root of 9 is 3, and 3 * 3 is indeed 9, which means the if condition is satisfied.
The code then prints the current value of n, which is 9, and returns, exiting the program.
<<<Output>>>
9
