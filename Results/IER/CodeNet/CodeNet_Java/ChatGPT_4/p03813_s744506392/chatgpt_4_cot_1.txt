<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable x.
The input provided is `1000`, so x is set to 1000.
Next, the code checks if the value of x is less than 1200 using an if-else statement.
Since 1000 is indeed less than 1200, the condition is true, and the code inside the if block is executed.
The code inside the if block prints "ABC" to the standard output.
No other conditions or loops are present, so the program will terminate after printing the output.
<<<Output>>>
ABC
