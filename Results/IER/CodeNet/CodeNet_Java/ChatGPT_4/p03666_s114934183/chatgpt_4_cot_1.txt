<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `5 1 5 2 4`. The `ContestReader` class reads these values and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` respectively. The `execute` method then calls the `solve` method with these values.

The `solve` method calculates the center of the range `[c, d]` as `centerCD` and the radius of this range as `rCD`. It then enters a for loop that iterates from `0` to `n-1` (in this case, from `0` to `4`).

For each iteration `i`, the method calculates two distances `d1` and `d2`. `d1` is the difference between the center of the range `[c, d]` multiplied by `i` and the center of the range `[c, d]` multiplied by `(n - 1 - i)`. `d2` is the radius of the range `[c, d]` multiplied by `(n - 1)`.

The method then checks if the sum of `a` and `d1` minus `d2` is less than or equal to `b` and if `b` is less than or equal to the sum of `a` and `d1` plus `d2`. If this condition is true for any iteration, the method returns `true`, indicating that there is a possible weight that is within the range `[a, b]`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Let's calculate the values for each iteration:
- For `i = 0`: `d1 = 0` and `d2 = 12`. The condition `1 - 12 <= 5 && 5 <= 1 + 12` is true.
- Since the condition is true for `i = 0`, the loop will exit early, and the method will return `true`.

The `execute` method then prints "YES" because the `solve` method returned `true`.
