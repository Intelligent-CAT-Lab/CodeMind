<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input. It then reads three integers a, b, and c with the values 700, 600, and 780, respectively. These values are stored in an array named sum.

The array sum is then sorted using the Arrays.sort() method. After sorting, the array will have the elements in ascending order, which will be {600, 700, 780}.

Finally, the code prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted array, which are sum[0] and sum[1]. The sum of 600 and 700 is 1300.

<<<Output>>>
1300
