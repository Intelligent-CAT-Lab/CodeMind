<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to encode a given string into a binary code using a predefined mapping (codeMap), and then decode that binary code back into text using another predefined mapping (charMap). The input string is `PETER POTTER`.

1. The codeMap HashMap is populated with binary strings for each character.
2. The charMap HashMap is populated with characters for each 5-bit binary string.
3. The Scanner object reads the input string `PETER POTTER`.
4. A StringBuffer object named codeBuf is created to hold the binary encoding of the input string.
5. The input string is iterated character by character, and the corresponding binary code is appended to codeBuf.
6. If the length of codeBuf is not a multiple of 5, '0's are appended to make it a multiple of 5.
7. The codeBuf is then split into 5-bit segments, and each segment is used to look up the corresponding character in charMap.
8. The characters are printed out without a newline until the end of the input, at which point a newline is printed.

Let's encode the input string `PETER POTTER`:
- P -> 111
- E -> 110
- T -> 00111
- E -> 110
- R -> 1000
- (space) -> 101
- P -> 111
- O -> 00101
- T -> 00111
- T -> 00111
- E -> 110
- R -> 1000

Concatenating these gives the binary string:
"111110001111101111001011110010100111001111101000"

This binary string is not a multiple of 5 in length, so we append '0's to make it a multiple of 5:
"11111000111110111100101111001010011100111110100000"

Now we split this into 5-bit segments and decode each segment:
- 11111 -> ?
- 00011 -> D
- 11101 -> -
- 11100 -> ,
- 10111 -> X
- 00101 -> F
- 00111 -> H
- 00111 -> H
- 11010 -> (space)
- 00000 -> A

The decoded string is `?D,-XFHH A`.

<<<Output>>>
?D,-XFHH A
