<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a MyScanner object named 'scan' to read input and a PrintWriter object named 'out' for output. It then reads two integers, n and k, from the input which are 3 and 2 respectively.

The code checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the result of n - k.

In this case, since k is 2 (which is not equal to 1), the code will execute the else block and print the result of n - k, which is 3 - 2.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the subtraction, which is 1.
