<<<Analysis>>>
The input `3 5 7 5` initializes the variables n, x, y, and z with 3, 5, 7, and 5 respectively. The variable sum is calculated as x + y + z + 1, which is 5 + 7 + 5 + 1 = 18. The variable mask is then calculated as 1 << sum, which is 1 << 18, and then mask is decremented by 1, resulting in mask = 262143.

A 2D array dp of size [n+1][mask+1] is created, which is dp[4][262144]. The variable ng is initialized to 0 and then updated to represent the forbidden states by shifting 1 by z, y+z, and x+y+z positions and performing bitwise OR operations. This results in ng = 1 << 5 | 1 << 12 | 1 << 18, which is ng = 32 | 4096 | 262144, and after the OR operations, ng = 262208.

The dp array is used for dynamic programming, where dp[i][state] represents the number of ways to reach a state with i digits. The initial state dp[0][1] is set to 1, representing one way to have zero digits.

The nested loops iterate over the number of digits (i from 0 to n-1) and all possible states (state from 0 to mask). For each state, it tries to append a digit j (from 1 to 10) to the current state and calculates the new state (res). If the new state contains the forbidden pattern (res & ng == ng), it skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, it updates the dp array for the next digit (i+1) and the new state (res) by adding the number of ways to reach the current state (dp[i][state]).

After filling the dp array, the variable ans is initialized to 1 and then multiplied by 10 for each digit (n times), resulting in ans = 10^n. This represents all possible combinations of n digits.

The final answer is calculated by subtracting the number of invalid combinations (sum of dp[n][i] for i from 0 to mask) from the total number of combinations (ans). Since the result must be modulo MOD, the answer is adjusted to be non-negative by adding MOD and then taking the result modulo MOD.

The output is then printed, which is the final value of ans after the adjustments.
