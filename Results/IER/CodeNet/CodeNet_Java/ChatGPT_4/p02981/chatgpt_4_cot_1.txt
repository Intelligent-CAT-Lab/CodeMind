<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input: n, a, and b, which are initialized with 4, 2, and 9 respectively according to the input.
It then calculates the minimum of two values: a * n and b. The first value is the product of a and n, which is 2 * 4 = 8. The second value is b, which is 9.
The Math.min function is used to determine the smaller of these two values, which in this case is 8.
Finally, the code prints the result of the Math.min function, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
