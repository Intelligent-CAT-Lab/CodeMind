<<<Analysis>>>
The input values are N=4, A=1, B=2, and K=5. The program calculates the number of ways to choose two sequences of non-negative integers that sum up to K, where the first sequence is multiplied by A and the second by B.

First, the program calculates the factorial of numbers from 0 to N modulo MOD (998244353) and stores them in the array fact. Then, it calculates the modular inverse of these factorials and stores them in the array factInv.

Next, the program calculates the binomial coefficients C(N, i) for i from 0 to N and stores them in the array comb. This is done using the formula C(N, i) = fact[N] * factInv[i] * factInv[N - i] modulo MOD.

The program then iterates from i=0 to N and for each i, it calculates b = (K - A * i) / B. If b is not an integer or b is outside the range [0, N], the program continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it adds the product of comb[i] and comb[b] modulo MOD to the answer.

Finally, the program prints the answer modulo MOD.

Let's calculate the values step by step:

fact = [1, 1, 2, 6, 24]
factInv = [1, 1, 499122177, 166374059, 291154603] (calculated using the inv function)
comb = [1, 4, 6, 4, 1] (calculated using the formula for binomial coefficients)

Now, we iterate i from 0 to 4:
- For i=0, b = (5 - 1*0) / 2 = 2.5 (not an integer, continue)
- For i=1, b = (5 - 1*1) / 2 = 2. Since b is an integer and within the range [0, N], we add comb[1] * comb[2] = 4 * 6 = 24 to ans.
- For i=2, b = (5 - 1*2) / 2 = 1.5 (not an integer, continue)
- For i=3, b = (5 - 1*3) / 2 = 0.5 (not an integer, continue)
- For i=4, b = (5 - 1*4) / 2 = -1.5 (not an integer and not within the range [0, N], continue)

The final answer is ans % MOD = 24 % 998244353 = 24.
