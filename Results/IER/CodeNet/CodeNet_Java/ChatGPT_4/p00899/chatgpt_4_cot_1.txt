<<<Analysis>>>
The provided code is incomplete and lacks the necessary input strings that follow the initial integer input `3`. The code is designed to process a list of strings after reading the initial integer which indicates the number of strings to follow. Without the subsequent string inputs, the code cannot produce a meaningful output.

The code appears to be for a problem-solving task, possibly from an online judge platform like Aizu Online Judge (AOJ), as indicated by the class name `AOJ1320`. The task likely involves string manipulation and optimization, as the code includes logic for removing strings that are substrings of others, calculating overlaps between strings, and finding the minimum length of a string that can be formed by concatenating the given strings without overlapping.

However, since the actual string inputs are not provided, we cannot proceed with the execution analysis or determine the output. The code execution would be stuck waiting for the string inputs after reading the initial integer `3`.

<<<Output>>>
Unable to determine the output without the complete input data.
