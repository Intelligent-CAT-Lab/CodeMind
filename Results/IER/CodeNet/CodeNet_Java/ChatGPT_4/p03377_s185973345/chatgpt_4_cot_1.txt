<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized with 3, 5, and 4 respectively according to the input.
The if condition checks two things:
1. If A is greater than C, which is not true in this case (3 is not greater than 4).
2. If A + B is less than C, which is also not true in this case (3 + 5 is not less than 4).

Since neither of the conditions is met, the else block is executed, and "YES" is printed as the output.
<<<Output>>>
YES
