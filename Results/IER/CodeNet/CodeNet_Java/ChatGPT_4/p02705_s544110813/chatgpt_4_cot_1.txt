<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with the `main` method and a `FastScanner` class for fast input reading. The `main` method creates an instance of `FastScanner` and reads a double value `n` from the input, which is `1` in this case.

The `main` method then calls the `p` method with the argument `2*Math.PI*n`. Since `n` is `1`, the expression evaluates to `2*Math.PI*1`, which is `2*Math.PI`. The value of `Math.PI` in Java is approximately `3.141592653589793`, so the expression evaluates to approximately `6.283185307179586`.

The `p` method is a generic method that prints the passed message to the standard output. Therefore, it will print the result of the expression `2*Math.PI*n`.

The `FastScanner` class is used to read the input more efficiently than the standard `Scanner` class. It reads bytes from the input stream and converts them into the required data types. In this case, it is used to read a double value from the input.

Given the input `1`, the output will be the circumference of a circle with a radius of `1`, which is `2*Math.PI*1`.
