<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `run` method that is executed when the program starts. The `run` method reads two long integers `X` and `Y` from the input using a custom `MyScanner` class.

The input provided is `2 1`. The `run` method reads these values such that `X` is assigned 2 and `Y` is assigned 1.

The code then checks if `X` is less than `Y`, and if so, it swaps the values. However, since `X` is not less than `Y` in this case, no swap occurs.

Next, the code checks if the difference between `X` and `Y` is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Brown".

Since `X` is 2 and `Y` is 1, the difference `X - Y` is 1, which is not greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the code will print "Brown".

Brown
