<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `4 2`. The main method starts a new thread with the TaskAdapter runnable, which in turn creates a FastInput and FastOutput to read from System.in and write to System.out. The FRotatedPalindromes solver is then used to solve the problem with the given input.

The `solve` method in FRotatedPalindromes reads two integers, `n` and `k`, which are 4 and 2 respectively. It then creates a Modular object with a modulus of 1e9 + 7 (which is 1000000007). It also calculates the inverse of 2 modulo 1000000007, which is 500000004.

The method then factorizes the number `n` (which is 4) using the `factorizeNumber` method from the Factorization class. The factors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4. These factors are sorted and stored in the array `factors`.

Next, the method calculates the number of ways to form a palindrome of length `d` (where `d` is each factor) using `k` characters. This is done by raising `k` to the power of the ceiling of `d/2`. For `k = 2`, the number of ways for each factor are:
- For factor 1: 2^(ceil(1/2)) = 2^1 = 2
- For factor 2: 2^(ceil(2/2)) = 2^1 = 2
- For factor 4: 2^(ceil(4/2)) = 2^2 = 4

These values are stored in the `cnt` array.

The method then adjusts the `cnt` array to ensure that each `cnt[i]` represents the number of palindromes of length exactly `factors[i]` by subtracting the counts of divisors of `factors[i]`. After this adjustment, the `cnt` array is:
- For factor 1: 2
- For factor 2: 2 - 2 = 0 (since 2 is a multiple of 1)
- For factor 4: 4 - 2 = 2 (since 4 is a multiple of 1)

Finally, the method calculates the answer by summing up `cnt[i] * factors[i]`, and if `factors[i]` is even, it multiplies `cnt[i]` by `inv2` before adding it to the sum. The final answer is:
- For factor 1: 2 * 1 = 2
- For factor 2: 0 * 2 = 0
- For factor 4: 2 * 4 * inv2 = 2 * 4 * 500000004 = 4000000016 % 1000000007 = 1

The sum of these values is 2 + 0 + 1 = 3, which is the final answer.
