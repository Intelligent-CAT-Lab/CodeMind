<<<Analysis>>>
The input values are assigned to the variables W, H, x, and y as 2, 3, 1, and 2 respectively.

The variable men is calculated as the area of the rectangle (W*H) divided by 2.0, which is (2*3)/2.0 = 3.0.

The variables a, b, c, and d are calculated as follows:
- a = x*H = 1*3 = 3
- b = (W*H) - a = (2*3) - 3 = 3
- c = y*W = 2*2 = 4
- d = (W*H) - c = (2*3) - 4 = 2

The variables xx and yy are calculated using the Math.min function:
- xx = Math.min(a, b) = Math.min(3, 3) = 3
- yy = Math.min(c, d) = Math.min(4, 2) = 2

The variable hou is initialized to 0 and then two if conditions are checked:
- If xx equals men, hou is incremented by 1. Since xx (3) equals men (3), hou becomes 1.
- If yy equals men, hou is incremented by 1. Since yy (2) does not equal men (3), hou remains 1.

The final if condition checks if hou is less than or equal to 1. Since hou is 1, it is less than or equal to 1, so hou remains 0.

The output is the value of men followed by the value of hou, which are 3.0 and 0 respectively.
