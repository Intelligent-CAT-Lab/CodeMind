<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method and a `FastScanner` class for fast input reading. The `main` method creates an instance of `FastScanner` and reads an integer `a` using `scan.nextInt()`. The input provided is `25`.

After reading the input, the program prints "Christmas". Then it enters a switch-case block where it prints additional " Eve" strings based on the value of `a`. Since `a` is `25`, it matches the case `25` and prints an empty string after "Christmas".

Therefore, the output will be "Christmas" followed by an empty string, which effectively means just "Christmas" will be printed.

<<<Output>>>
Christmas
