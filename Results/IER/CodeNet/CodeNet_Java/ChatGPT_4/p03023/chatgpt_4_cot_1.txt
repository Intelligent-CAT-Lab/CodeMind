<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in).
The variable num is initialized with the value 3 according to the input.
The variable answer is calculated by multiplying 180 with (num - 2), which is (3 - 2) in this case.
The calculation becomes 180 * 1, which equals 180.
The program then prints the value of answer, which is 180.
<<<Output>>>
180
