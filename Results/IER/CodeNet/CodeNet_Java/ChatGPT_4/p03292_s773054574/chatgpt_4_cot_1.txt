<<<Analysis>>>
The input `1 6 3` is read and stored in an integer array `A` of size 3. The array `A` now contains the elements [1, 6, 3].

The `Arrays.sort(A)` method is called, which sorts the array `A` in ascending order. After sorting, the array `A` becomes [1, 3, 6].

The `solve` method then calls `prn(A[2] - A[0])`, which calculates the difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted array `A`. This is `A[2] - A[0] = 6 - 1 = 5`.

The `prn` method prints the result of the calculation, which is `5`.

Therefore, the output of the code execution will be `5`.
