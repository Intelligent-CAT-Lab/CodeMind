<<<Analysis>>>
The provided input `w h g` is not a valid input for the given Java program. The program expects a sequence of integers and a string as input, but `w h g` consists of alphabetic characters. The program uses a Scanner object to read integers and a string from the standard input. The expected input format should be a sequence of integers representing the width and height of a grid, the goal position, the number of obstacles, the positions of the obstacles, and a string representing a sequence of moves.

Since the input `w h g` does not match the expected format, the program will throw an InputMismatchException when attempting to read the first integer using `sc.nextInt()`. This exception is not caught in the program, so it will terminate the execution and print the stack trace of the exception to the standard error stream.

Therefore, the output will not be a result of the program logic but an error message indicating that an exception has occurred.
