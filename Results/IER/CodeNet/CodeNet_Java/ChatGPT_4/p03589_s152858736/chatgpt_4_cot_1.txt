<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to find three positive integers h, w, and n that satisfy a certain equation related to the input integer n. The equation is derived from a problem statement which is not provided here, but the code attempts to solve it by brute-forcing through possible values of h and w until it finds a set of values that satisfy the condition.

The main method initializes the program, which then calls the `run` method. The `run` method sets up the input stream and output writer, and then calls the `solve` method.

The `solve` method reads an integer n using the `ni()` method, which reads bytes from the input until it encounters a digit or a minus sign, then reads the number. In this case, the input is `2`, so n is set to 2.

The `solve` method then creates a new instance of the `Solver` class and calls its `solve` method with the input n. The `Solver` class's `solve` method contains a nested loop that iterates over possible values of h and w, from 1 to 3500.

For each pair of h and w, it calculates a `dividend` and a `divisor` based on the input n, h, and w. The condition to be satisfied is that the `divisor` is greater than 0 and that the `dividend` is exactly divisible by the `divisor`. If such a condition is met, it returns an array containing h, w, and the result of `dividend / divisor`.

The first set of values that satisfy the condition for n=2 are h=1, w=1, because:
dividend = 2 * 1 * 1 = 2
divisor = 4 * 1 * 1 - 2 * 1 - 2 * 1 = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0

Since the divisor is not greater than 0 for h=1 and w=1, the loop continues. The next set of values that satisfy the condition are h=1, w=2, because:
dividend = 2 * 1 * 2 = 4
divisor = 4 * 1 * 2 - 2 * 2 - 2 * 1 = 8 - 4 - 2 = 2

The divisor is greater than 0 and the dividend is exactly divisible by the divisor, so the method returns an array containing {1, 2, 4 / 2} which is {1, 2, 2}.

The `solve` method then prints out the values in the returned array separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output of the code execution given the input `2` will be "1 2 2".
