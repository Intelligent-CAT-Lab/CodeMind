<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "2019/04/30" is read and stored in the variable S. The string is then split by the "/" character, resulting in an array of strings ["2019", "04", "30"] which is stored in the array s.

The first element of the array s is parsed as an integer and stored in the variable year, which will be 2019.
The second element of the array s is parsed as an integer and stored in the variable month, which will be 4.
The third element of the array s is parsed as an integer and stored in the variable day, which will be 30.

The code then checks the year, month, and day to determine the era. Since the year is equal to 2019, it enters the else if block. Inside this block, it checks if the month is greater than or equal to 5. Since the month is 4, which is less than 5, it does not satisfy the condition to print "TBD". Instead, it prints "Heisei" because the date falls within the Heisei era, which ended on April 30, 2019.
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
