<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is `fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.`. The program iterates over each character of the string and checks if the character is uppercase or lowercase. If the character is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase, and if it's lowercase, it converts it to uppercase. The program does not change characters that are not letters, such as spaces or punctuation marks.

The transformation of each character is as follows:
- 'f' is lowercase, so it becomes 'F'
- 'A' is uppercase, so it becomes 'a'
- 'I' is uppercase, so it becomes 'i'
- 'R' is uppercase, so it becomes 'r'
- ',' remains unchanged
- ' ' (space) remains unchanged
- 'L' is uppercase, so it becomes 'l'
- 'A' is uppercase, so it becomes 'a'
- 'T' is uppercase, so it becomes 't'
- 'E' is uppercase, so it becomes 'e'
- 'R' is uppercase, so it becomes 'r'
- ',' remains unchanged
- ' ' (space) remains unchanged
- 'O' is uppercase, so it becomes 'o'
- 'C' is uppercase, so it becomes 'c'
- 'C' is uppercase, so it becomes 'c'
- 'A' is uppercase, so it becomes 'a'
- 'S' is uppercase, so it becomes 's'
- 'I' is uppercase, so it becomes 'i'
- 'O' is uppercase, so it becomes 'o'
- 'N' is uppercase, so it becomes 'n'
- 'A' is uppercase, so it becomes 'a'
- 'L' is uppercase, so it becomes 'l'
- 'L' is uppercase, so it becomes 'l'
- 'Y' is uppercase, so it becomes 'y'
- ' ' (space) remains unchanged
- 'C' is uppercase, so it becomes 'c'
- 'L' is uppercase, so it becomes 'l'
- 'O' is uppercase, so it becomes 'o'
- 'U' is uppercase, so it becomes 'u'
- 'D' is uppercase, so it becomes 'd'
- 'Y' is uppercase, so it becomes 'y'
- '.' remains unchanged

After processing each character, the program prints out the transformed string and a newline character at the end.
