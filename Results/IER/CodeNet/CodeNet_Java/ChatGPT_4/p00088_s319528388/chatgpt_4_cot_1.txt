<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a method `run()` that performs a custom encoding and decoding of strings based on predefined mappings in two HashMaps, `hash` and `hash2`. The `hash` map associates characters with their corresponding binary strings, while `hash2` maps 5-character binary strings to characters.

The `run()` method reads input lines using a `Scanner` object until there are no more lines to read. For each line, it performs the following steps:

1. It initializes an empty string `dec`.
2. It iterates over each character in the input line and appends the corresponding binary string from `hash` to `dec`.
3. It initializes an empty string `ret`.
4. It processes `dec` in chunks of 5 characters (or less if `dec` has fewer than 5 characters left). For each chunk, it looks up the corresponding character in `hash2` and appends it to `ret`.
5. If a chunk is less than 5 characters, it pads the chunk with zeros to make it 5 characters long before looking it up in `hash2`.
6. It prints the final decoded string `ret`.

Given the input `PETER POTTER`, the method will encode each character to its binary string and then decode it back to a character using the 5-character chunks.

Let's go through the input step by step:

- 'P' is encoded to "111".
- 'E' is encoded to "110".
- 'T' is encoded to "00111".
- 'E' is encoded to "110".
- 'R' is encoded to "1000".
- ' ' (space) is encoded to "101".
- 'P' is encoded to "111".
- 'O' is encoded to "00101".
- 'T' is encoded to "00111".
- 'T' is encoded to "00111".
- 'E' is encoded to "110".
- 'R' is encoded to "1000".

The concatenated binary string is:
"111110001111101111100101001110011110001000"

Now, we decode it in chunks of 5 characters:
- "11111" decodes to '?'.
- "00011" decodes to 'D'.
- "11010" decodes to ' '.
- "11110" decodes to '\''.
- "11100" decodes to ','.
- "10100" decodes to 'U'.
- "11100" decodes to ','.
- "10000" decodes to 'Q'.

The final decoded string is "?D ',U,Q".

<<<Output>>>
?D ',U,Q
