<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "abac" is read and stored in the variable S. The AtCoder class constructor is called with the FastScanner object sc, and the string "abac" is assigned to S.

The solve method of the AtCoder class is then called. It initializes an array cnt of size 3 to store the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' characters in the string S.

The for loop iterates over each character in the string "abac". It increments the count in the cnt array for each occurrence of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. After the loop, the counts are:
- cnt[0] (for 'a') = 2
- cnt[1] (for 'b') = 1
- cnt[2] (for 'c') = 1

The cnt array is then sorted, resulting in:
- cnt[0] = 1
- cnt[1] = 1
- cnt[2] = 2

The difference between the highest count (cnt[2]) and the lowest count (cnt[0]) is calculated as 2 - 1 = 1.

The condition (cnt[2] - cnt[0] <= 1) is checked, which evaluates to true because 1 <= 1.

Since the condition is true, the My.ANS method is called with the argument true, which prints "YES".
