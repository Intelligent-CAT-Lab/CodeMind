<<<Analysis>>>
The input "54 20" is read and split into two strings "54" and "20", which are then parsed into integers a and b with values 54 and 20 respectively.

The main method calls the GCD method with these two numbers.

In the GCD method, the first if statement checks if a is less than b, which is not the case here (54 is not less than 20), so the values of a and b remain unchanged.

The second if statement checks if a is divisible by b (if 54 % 20 == 0), which is also not the case, so the method proceeds to the else statement.

The else statement calls the GCD method recursively with the values of b and a % b (20 and 54 % 20, which is 14).

The GCD method is now called with a = 20 and b = 14.

Again, the first if statement checks if a is less than b, which is not the case, so the values remain unchanged.

The second if statement checks if a is divisible by b (if 20 % 14 == 0), which is not the case, so the method proceeds to the else statement.

The else statement calls the GCD method recursively with the values of b and a % b (14 and 20 % 14, which is 6).

The GCD method is now called with a = 14 and b = 6.

Again, the first if statement checks if a is less than b, which is not the case, so the values remain unchanged.

The second if statement checks if a is divisible by b (if 14 % 6 == 0), which is not the case, so the method proceeds to the else statement.

The else statement calls the GCD method recursively with the values of b and a % b (6 and 14 % 6, which is 2).

The GCD method is now called with a = 6 and b = 2.

Again, the first if statement checks if a is less than b, which is not the case, so the values remain unchanged.

The second if statement checks if a is divisible by b (if 6 % 2 == 0), which is the case, so the method returns b, which is 2.

The value 2 is then printed as the output of the program.
