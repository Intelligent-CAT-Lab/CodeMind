<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "pdbq". The length of the string `l` is 4. The for loop will iterate from i=0 to i=1 because (l+1)/2 is 2.5 and in integer division, it will be 2.

In the first iteration (i=0), the character at index 0 is 'p'. According to the given character transformation rules, 'p' should be transformed to 'q'. The character at the mirror position in the string (l-1-i), which is at index 3, is 'q'. Since 'q' equals 'q', the loop continues.

In the second iteration (i=1), the character at index 1 is 'd'. According to the rules, 'd' should be transformed to 'b'. The character at the mirror position (l-1-i), which is at index 2, is 'b'. Since 'b' equals 'b', the loop continues.

The loop completes without printing "No", so after the loop, "Yes" is printed to indicate that the string is a mirror string according to the given transformation rules.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
