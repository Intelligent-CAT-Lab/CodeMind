<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input. In this case, a is 4 and b is 12 based on the given input.

The main line of logic is a ternary operator that checks if b is divisible by a (b % a == 0). If it is, the code will output the sum of a and b (a + b). If it is not, the code will output the difference of b and a (b - a).

Given the input `4 12`, since 12 is divisible by 4 (12 % 4 == 0), the condition of the ternary operator is true. Therefore, the code will output the sum of a and b, which is 4 + 12 = 16.

<<<Output>>>
16
