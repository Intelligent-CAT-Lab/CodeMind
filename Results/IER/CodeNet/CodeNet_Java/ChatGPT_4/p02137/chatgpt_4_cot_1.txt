<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer from the input and stores it in the variable p. The input provided is 5700, so p is set to 5700.
The code then prints the result of the expression `p / 500 * 500`. This expression first divides p by 500, which is `5700 / 500 = 11`. Since both p and 500 are integers, the result of the division is also an integer, so the fractional part is discarded, and the result is just 11.
Then, this result is multiplied by 500, which is `11 * 500 = 5500`.
Finally, the code prints this result, which is 5500.
<<<Output>>>
5500
