<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two integer variables, n and k, with the values 7 and 3 respectively according to the input. It then declares an integer variable ans.
The code checks if n is divisible by k without any remainder using the modulo operator (n % k). If the remainder is 0, it means n is divisible by k, and ans is set to 0. Otherwise, ans is set to 1.
In this case, 7 is not divisible by 3 (7 % 3 is not equal to 0), so ans is set to 1.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 1.
