The variables h and w are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0L (Long type with value 0).

The first if condition checks if both h and w are not divisible by 3. Since h is 3 and w is 5, h % 3 equals 0 and w % 3 equals 2, so the condition h % 3 != 0 && w % 3 != 0 is false. Therefore, the entire block of code inside this if condition is skipped.

Since the if condition is not met, the program does not enter the block and does not modify the ans variable. Therefore, the value of ans remains 0.

The program then prints the value of ans, which is 0.
