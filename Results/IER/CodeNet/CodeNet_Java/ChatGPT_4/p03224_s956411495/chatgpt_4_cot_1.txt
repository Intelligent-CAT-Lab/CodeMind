The input is `3`. The `solveE()` method is called in the `solve()` method, which is the only method called in the `main()` method. The `solveE()` method is responsible for solving the problem described in the comments as "D - Crossing" from the AtCoder contest.

The `solveE()` method starts by reading the input `n` as `3`. It then initializes `k` to `1` and enters a while loop that continues as long as `k * (k - 1)` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. The loop is looking for a `k` such that `k * (k - 1) == 2 * n`. If such a `k` is found, it calls the `print(n, k)` method to print the solution and returns, ending the method.

The condition `k * (k - 1) == 2 * n` is derived from the problem statement, which requires finding a `k` such that `2 * n = k * (k - 1)`. This is a requirement for the problem to have a solution.

For `n = 3`, the loop starts with `k = 1` and checks if `1 * (1 - 1) == 2 * 3`, which is not true. It increments `k` to `2` and checks if `2 * (2 - 1) == 2 * 3`, which is also not true. It increments `k` to `3` and checks if `3 * (3 - 1) == 2 * 3`, which is true because `3 * 2 == 6`.

Since the condition is met, the `print(n, k)` method is called with `n = 3` and `k = 3`. The `print()` method creates an array of lists `g` with `k` lists. It then populates these lists with integers representing the connections between elements in a way that each element is connected to `k - 1` other elements, and each pair is connected exactly once.

The `print()` method then prints "Yes" to indicate that a solution is possible, followed by the value of `k`. It then iterates over each list in `g` and prints the size of the list followed by the elements of the list, separated by spaces.

For `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the expected output would be a "Yes" followed by `k`, and then three lines representing the three lists of connections. Each list will have two elements since `k - 1 = 2`.

The output will be:
```
Yes
3
2 1 2
2 1 3
2 2 3
```

This output represents a solution where there are 3 sets (S1, S2, S3), and each set is connected to the other two sets with unique connections (A, B, C). The connections are represented by the numbers following the size of each set.
