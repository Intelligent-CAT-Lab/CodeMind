<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads three integers A, B, and C from the input.

The input provided is `2 2 2`, so A, B, and C are all set to the value 2.

The code then checks if A is equal to B and A is also equal to C. Since all three variables have the same value (2), the condition is true.

Because the condition is true, the code prints "Yes" to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
