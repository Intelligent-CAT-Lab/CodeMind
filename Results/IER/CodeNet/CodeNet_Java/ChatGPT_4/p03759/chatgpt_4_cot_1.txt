<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c. The input provided is `2 4 6`, so a=2, b=4, and c=6.

The if statement checks whether the difference between a and b is equal to the difference between b and c. In this case, a-b equals 2-4, which is -2, and b-c equals 4-6, which is also -2. Since both differences are equal, the condition of the if statement is true.

Therefore, the code will execute the first branch of the if statement and print "YES" to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
YES
