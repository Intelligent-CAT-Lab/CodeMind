<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable 'a' which is assigned the value 68 based on the input provided.

The next line of code calculates the result of the expression (a - 30) / 2. For the input value of 68, the calculation proceeds as follows:

(a - 30) / 2
(68 - 30) / 2
38 / 2
19

The result of the calculation is 19, which is then printed to the standard output using System.out.println.

<<<Output>>>
19
