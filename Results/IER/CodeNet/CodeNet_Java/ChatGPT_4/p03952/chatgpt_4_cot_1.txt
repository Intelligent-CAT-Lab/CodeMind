<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `4 4`, which means N is 4 and x is 4. The program first checks if x is equal to 1 or 2*N-1 (which is 7 in this case). Since x is neither 1 nor 7, the program prints "Yes".

Next, the program calls the solve method with N=4 and x=4. Since N is not equal to 2, it skips the first if condition and goes to the else block.

In the else block, the following assignments are made to the ans array:
- ans[N-2] = ans[2] = 1
- ans[N-1] = ans[3] = x = 4
- ans[N] = ans[4] = 2*N-1 = 7
- ans[N+1] = ans[5] = 2

Then, it initializes elm to 3 and starts a for loop to fill the rest of the ans array. The loop checks if elm is equal to x (which is 4), and if so, it increments elm to skip the value of x. It also checks if the current ans[index] is 0, and if so, it assigns the value of elm to ans[index] and increments elm.

The loop fills the ans array as follows:
- ans[0] = 3 (since ans[0] was 0 and elm was 3)
- ans[1] = 5 (since ans[1] was 0 and elm was incremented to 5 after skipping 4)
- ans[6] = 6 (since ans[6] was 0 and elm was incremented to 6)

The final ans array is [3, 5, 1, 4, 7, 2, 6].

The program then prints each element of the ans array on a new line.
