<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `a` with a predefined set of integers. It then creates a `Scanner` object to read input from the user. The input is stored in the integer variable `k`. The code then prints the value at the index `k-1` of the array `a`.

Given the input `6`, the code will look for the value at index `6-1` (since array indices in Java are 0-based). The index `5` in the array `a` corresponds to the value `2`. Therefore, the output will be the value `2`.
