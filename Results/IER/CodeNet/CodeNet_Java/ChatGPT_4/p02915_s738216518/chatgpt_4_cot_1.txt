<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable n.

The input provided is `2`, so n is set to 2.

Next, there is an if statement that checks if n is between 1 and 9, inclusive. Since n is 2, it satisfies this condition.

Inside the if block, the code calculates the cube of n (n*n*n). For n = 2, the cube is 2*2*2, which equals 8.

Finally, the code prints the result of the cube operation, which is 8.

<<<Output>>>
8
