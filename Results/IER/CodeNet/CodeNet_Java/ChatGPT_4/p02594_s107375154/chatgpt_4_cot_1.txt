<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads an integer value and assigns it to the variable x. The input provided is 25, so x is set to 25.

Next, the code checks if x is greater than or equal to 30. Since 25 is not greater than or equal to 30, the condition is false.

Therefore, the else block is executed, and "No" is printed to the console.

<<<Output>>>
No
