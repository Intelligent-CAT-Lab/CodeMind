<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized with 10, 9, 10, and 10 respectively according to the input.
The variable cntT is calculated as c / b, which is 10 / 9. Since integer division is used, cntT is assigned the value 1. However, because c % b is not equal to 0 (10 % 9 equals 1), the if condition is true, and cntT is incremented by 1, resulting in cntT being 2.
The variable cntA is calculated as a / d, which is 10 / 10. Since integer division is used and the division is exact, cntA is assigned the value 1. The if condition a % d != 0 is false because 10 % 10 equals 0, so cntA remains 1.
The final print statement checks if cntT is less than or equal to cntA. Since cntT (2) is greater than cntA (1), the condition is false, and "No" is printed.
<<<Output>>>
No
