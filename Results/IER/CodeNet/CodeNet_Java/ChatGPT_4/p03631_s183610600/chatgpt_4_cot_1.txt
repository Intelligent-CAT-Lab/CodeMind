<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and converts it to a character array named 'n'. The input given is "575". The character array 'n' will contain {'5', '7', '5'}.
The code then prints "Yes" if the first and the third characters of the array are the same, otherwise it prints "No".
Since 'n[0]' is '5' and 'n[2]' is also '5', the condition 'n[0] == n[2]' is true.
Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
