<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `1 21`. The variables a and b are initialized with 1 and 21 respectively. The lengths of a and b are calculated and stored in variables aa and bb. The length of a (1) is 1 and the length of b (21) is 2.

The first if condition checks if the lengths of a and b are 1 and 1, or 2 and 1, or 3 and 1, which is not the case here, so it skips this block.

The second if condition checks if the lengths of a and b are 1 and 2, or 2 and 2, or 3 and 2, which is true for the input (1 and 2). Therefore, it enters this block.

Inside this block, the variable c is calculated as 100 * a + b, which is 100 * 1 + 21 = 121.

A for loop is then executed to check if there is an integer i such that i * i equals c. The loop runs from i = 0 to i < c (121). When i reaches 11, the condition i * i == c is true because 11 * 11 equals 121.

Since the condition is met, "Yes" is printed, and the loop breaks without checking further numbers.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
