<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "oxxoxoo" is read and converted to a character array c[].
The array c[] will contain the characters {'o', 'x', 'x', 'o', 'x', 'o', 'o'}.
The program then checks if the first character (c[0]) is 'x' and the last character (c[c.length-1]) is 'x'.
For the given input, c[0] is 'o' and c[c.length-1] is 'o'.
Since the first character is not 'x', the condition c[0]=='x' is false.
Therefore, the ternary operator will evaluate to the second option after the colon, which is "o".
The program will then print "o".
<<<Output>>>
o
