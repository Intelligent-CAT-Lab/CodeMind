<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two integers, n and m, which are assigned the values 3 and 3 respectively according to the input provided.

The variable re is initialized with the string "No". The code then checks if n is equal to m. Since both n and m are 3, the condition is true, and the value of re is changed to "Yes".

Finally, the code prints the value of re, which is "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
