<<<Analysis>>>
The input `10 9 10 10` initializes the variables a, b, c, and d with 10, 9, 10, and 10 respectively.

The code then calculates the following:
- t = c / b = 10 / 9 = 1 (since t is an int, it will only store the integer part)
- tt = c % b = 10 % 9 = 1
- y = a / d = 10 / 10 = 1
- u = a % d = 10 % 10 = 0

However, these calculated values (t, tt, y, u) are not used in the rest of the code.

The code enters a while loop with the condition `a >= 0 || c >= 0`. Since both a and c are initialized to 10, the condition is true and the loop starts.

Inside the loop:
- c is decreased by b (c = c - b), so c becomes 10 - 9 = 1.
- The code checks if c is less than or equal to 0. Since c is 1, the condition is false, and the loop continues.
- a is decreased by d (a = a - d), so a becomes 10 - 10 = 0.
- The code checks if a is less than or equal to 0. Since a is 0, the condition is true, and the code prints "No" and returns.

The loop does not continue after this because the return statement exits the main method.
