<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer from the input using a Scanner object. It then compares this integer to the value 1200. If the integer is less than 1200, it prints "ABC". If the integer is 1200 or greater, it prints "ARC". Since the input provided is `1000`, which is less than `1200`, the condition `s.nextInt()<1200` evaluates to true, and therefore "ABC" will be printed.
<<<Output>>>
ABC
