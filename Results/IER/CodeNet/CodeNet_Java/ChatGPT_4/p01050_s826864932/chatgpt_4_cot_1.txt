<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `0ig3he12fz99` is processed by the code as follows:

1. The Scanner class reads the input and converts it to a character array.
2. Two arrays, `alpha_count` and `number_count`, are created to count the occurrences of each alphabet character and number respectively.
3. The input is iterated character by character. For each character:
   - If it's an alphabet character ('a' to 'z'), the corresponding index in `alpha_count` is incremented.
   - If it's a number ('0' to '9'), the corresponding index in `number_count` is incremented.
4. The counts for the characters are:
   - Alphabets: {'a':0, 'b':0, 'c':0, 'd':0, 'e':1, 'f':1, 'g':1, 'h':1, 'i':1, 'j':0, 'k':0, 'l':0, 'm':0, 'n':0, 'o':0, 'p':0, 'q':0, 'r':0, 's':0, 't':0, 'u':0, 'v':0, 'w':0, 'x':0, 'y':0, 'z':1}
   - Numbers: {0:1, 1:2, 2:1, 3:1, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:0, 8:0, 9:2}
5. The `compress` function is called for both `alpha_count` and `number_count`.
6. In `compress`, the function looks for sequences of 3 or more consecutive non-zero counts and reduces each count in the sequence by 1. It also adds the length of the sequence minus 3 to the `ret` variable.
7. For the alphabets, there are no sequences of 3 or more consecutive non-zero counts, so `compress` returns 0 and `alpha_count` remains unchanged.
8. For the numbers, there is a sequence of 3 consecutive non-zero counts (1, 2, 3). The `compress` function reduces each count by 1 and adds 0 to `ret` (since the sequence length is 3 and 3 - 3 = 0).
9. After compression, the counts are:
   - Alphabets: {'a':0, 'b':0, 'c':0, 'd':0, 'e':1, 'f':1, 'g':1, 'h':1, 'i':1, 'j':0, 'k':0, 'l':0, 'm':0, 'n':0, 'o':0, 'p':0, 'q':0, 'r':0, 's':0, 't':0, 'u':0, 'v':0, 'w':0, 'x':0, 'y':0, 'z':1}
   - Numbers: {0:1, 1:1, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:0, 8:0, 9:2}
10. The length of the input string is initially 13. It is reduced by the sum of the reductions from `compress`, which is 0 for both alphabets and numbers.
11. The final length is printed, which is 13 - 0 - 0 = 13.
