<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `6`, which is assigned to the variable `K`. An array `dp` of size `K` (6) is created and filled with `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

A `PriorityQueue` named `que` is created to store `Node` objects, which have two properties: `to` and `cost`. The queue is ordered by the `cost` in ascending order.

A for loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < min(10, K)` (which is `6` in this case), initializing `dp[i]` with `i` and adding a new `Node(i, i)` to the queue `que`.

The main loop continues until the queue is empty. It polls the queue to get the node with the smallest cost. It then checks if the cost of this node is greater than the current cost in `dp` at index `v`. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.

If not, it runs another loop from `i = 0` to `i < 10`, calculating `nextv` as `(v * 10 + i) % K` and `nextc` as `c + i`. If `dp[nextv]` is greater than `nextc`, it updates `dp[nextv]` with `nextc` and adds a new `Node(nextv, nextc)` to the queue.

The process continues until the queue is empty. Finally, it prints the value of `dp[0]`.

Let's simulate the process:

1. `dp` is initialized as `[MAX, MAX, MAX, MAX, MAX, MAX]`.
2. The for loop runs and updates `dp` to `[MAX, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and adds nodes to the queue with the same values.
3. The main loop starts processing the queue:
   - Polls `Node(1, 1)`, checks `dp[1]` which is not greater than `1`, so it processes it.
   - Inside the inner loop, it calculates `nextv` and `nextc` for `i` from `0` to `9`.
   - For `i = 0`, `nextv = (1 * 10 + 0) % 6 = 4`, `nextc = 1 + 0 = 1`. Since `dp[4]` is `4`, it updates `dp[4]` to `1` and adds `Node(4, 1)` to the queue.
   - This continues for other values of `i`, but none will update `dp` since `nextc` will be greater than the current values in `dp`.
   - The queue now contains nodes like `Node(4, 1)`, and others added in the first for loop.
4. The loop continues processing nodes like `Node(4, 1)`, which will eventually lead to the creation of a `Node(0, 6)` because:
   - `nextv = (4 * 10 + 2) % 6 = 0`, `nextc = 1 + 2 = 3`. Since `dp[0]` is `MAX`, it updates `dp[0]` to `3` and adds `Node(0, 3)` to the queue.
   - No further updates to `dp[0]` will occur since `3` is the smallest possible cost to get a number divisible by `6` using the digits `1` to `5`.

The final `dp` array is `[3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5]`. The program prints the value of `dp[0]`, which is `3`.
