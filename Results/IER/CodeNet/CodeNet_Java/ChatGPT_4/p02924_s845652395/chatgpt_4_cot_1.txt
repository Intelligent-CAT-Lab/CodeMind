<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main class with a main method and an inner class MyScanner. The MyScanner class is used to read input from the standard input stream.

The main method creates an instance of MyScanner and reads a long integer 'n' from the input, which in this case is 2.

The main method then calculates the value of 'n * (n-1) / 2'. For the input 2, this calculation is as follows:
n * (n-1) / 2 = 2 * (2-1) / 2 = 2 * 1 / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1

The result of this calculation is then printed to the standard output.
