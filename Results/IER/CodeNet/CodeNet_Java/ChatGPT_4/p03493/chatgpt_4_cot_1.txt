<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "101" is assigned to variable a. The variable marbles is initialized to 0.
The program enters a for loop that iterates over each character of the string a.
In the first iteration, i = 0, a.charAt(i) is '1', so marbles is incremented by 1.
In the second iteration, i = 1, a.charAt(i) is '0', so marbles is not incremented.
In the third iteration, i = 2, a.charAt(i) is '1', so marbles is incremented by 1 again.
After the loop, marbles has a value of 2, which is the number of '1' characters in the string "101".
The program then prints the value of marbles.
<<<Output>>>
2
