<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `?MG?` has a length N of 4. The program initializes several arrays and objects to handle bitwise operations and to calculate the final answer based on the input string.

First, it initializes an array `pow3` to store powers of 3 modulo MOD (998244353). This array will be used to calculate the number of combinations based on the number of question marks in the input string.

Next, it initializes four `Bits` objects: `bsf1`, `bsf2`, `bsb1`, and `bsb2`. These objects will be used to store the positions of 'G', '?', 'U', and '?' in the input string, respectively, both from the front (fs) and from the back (bs).

The variable `Q` is initialized to count the number of question marks in the input string. In this case, there are 2 question marks, so `Q` is set to 2.

The program then iterates over the input string and sets the corresponding bits in the `Bits` objects based on the characters 'G', 'U', and '?'.

After setting up the `Bits` objects, the program initializes four buffers `buff1`, `buff2`, `bufb1`, and `bufb2` to store intermediate results during the calculation.

The main loop iterates over the positions in the input string, excluding the first and last characters. For each position `i`, if the character at that position is 'M' or '?', the program calculates the number of valid combinations that can be formed by replacing '?' with 'G' or 'U' and ensuring that 'G' and 'U' are symmetric around 'M'.

For the input string `?MG?`, the loop will run for the positions 1 and 2 (0-based index), corresponding to the characters 'M' and 'G'.

For position 1 ('M'):
- `q` is set to 1 because there is one '?' left after considering 'M'.
- The `Bits` objects are copied into the buffers with appropriate shifts.
- The program calculates the number of valid combinations using bitwise operations and the `pow3` array.
- The answer is incremented accordingly and taken modulo MOD.

For position 2 ('G'):
- `q` is set to 2 because there are two '?' in the string.
- The `Bits` objects are copied into the buffers with appropriate shifts.
- The program calculates the number of valid combinations using bitwise operations and the `pow3` array.
- The answer is incremented accordingly and taken modulo MOD.

Finally, the program prints the calculated answer.

Let's calculate the answer manually:
- For position 1 ('M'), we can have the following combinations: `GMG?`, `?MG?`. This gives us 2 * 3^1 = 6 combinations.
- For position 2 ('G'), we can have the following combinations: `GUG?`, `?UG?`, `GGG?`, `?GG?`. This gives us 4 * 3^2 = 36 combinations.

Adding them up, we get 6 + 36 = 42. However, we need to consider that the combinations `?MG?` and `?GG?` are counted twice, once for each '?' being 'G' and 'U'. So we subtract 2 * 3^0 = 2 from the total.

The final answer is 42 - 2 = 40.
