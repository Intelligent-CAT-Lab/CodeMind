<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user. The variable N is initialized with the string "1222" according to the input. The variable cnt is initialized with 0 to count the occurrences of the character '2'.

The code then checks each character of the string N to see if it is equal to '2':
- The first character of N is '1', so the first if condition is false and cnt remains 0.
- The second character of N is '2', so the second if condition is true and cnt is incremented to 1.
- The third character of N is '2', so the third if condition is true and cnt is incremented to 2.
- The fourth character of N is '2', so the fourth if condition is true and cnt is incremented to 3.

After checking all characters, the code prints the value of cnt, which is the total number of '2's in the string N.
