<<<Analysis>>>
The input "10 30 20" is read and split into an array of strings ["10", "30", "20"]. This array is then converted into an array of integers [10, 30, 20].

The array of integers is then sorted using Arrays.sort(num), resulting in the sorted array [10, 20, 30].

The program then checks if the sum of the first two elements (10 + 20) is equal to the third element (30). Since 10 + 20 equals 30, the condition is true.

Therefore, the program will print "Yes" as the output.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
