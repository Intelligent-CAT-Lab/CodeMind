<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two numbers as input and multiplies them. The Scanner object `cin` is used to read the input from the user. The `nextBigInteger()` method of the Scanner object reads the next token of the input as a BigInteger. The input provided is `5 8`, so the first call to `nextBigInteger()` will read `5` and the second call will read `8`. These two BigInteger values are then multiplied using the `multiply` method of the BigInteger class. The result of the multiplication of 5 and 8 is 40. The result is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
40
