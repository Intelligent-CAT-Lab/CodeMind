<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in).

The variables N, X, and T are initialized with the values 20, 12, and 6 respectively according to the input.

The code then checks if N is divisible by X using the modulus operator (%). If N is divisible by X, it means that the exact number of batches (N/X) can be processed, each taking T time. In this case, the total time is simply the number of batches times the time per batch (N/X * T).

If N is not divisible by X, it means that there will be an additional batch that is not full, but it still takes the full T time to process. In this case, the total time is the number of full batches times the time per batch plus the time for the additional batch (N/X * T + T).

For the given input, N is 20 and X is 12. Since 20 is not divisible by 12, the else block will execute. The number of full batches is 20/12 which is 1 (since we are dealing with integers, the fractional part is discarded). The time for one batch is 6, so the total time for the full batches is 1 * 6 = 6. Since there is an additional batch, we add another T, which is 6, to the total time.

Therefore, the total time is 6 (for the full batch) + 6 (for the additional batch) = 12.
