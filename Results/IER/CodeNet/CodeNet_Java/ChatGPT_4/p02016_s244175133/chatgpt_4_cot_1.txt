<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads a string `s` using `sc.next()`, which will read the next token from the input (in this case, the word "ani").

The if statement checks if the string `s` is equal to "ani". Since the input provided is "ani", the condition of the if statement is true.

As a result, the program will execute the code within the if block, which prints "square1001" to the standard output.

The else block is ignored since the if condition was true.

<<<Output>>>
square1001
