<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "BBBWW". The program converts this string into a character array input_char[] which will be ['B', 'B', 'B', 'W', 'W'].

The variable current_char is initialized with the first character of the array, which is 'B'. The variable count is initialized with 0.

The program enters a for loop that iterates from the second character to the last character of the input_char array.

In the first iteration (i=1), input_char[i] is 'B', which is equal to current_char ('B'), so the count remains 0 and current_char remains 'B'.

In the second iteration (i=2), input_char[i] is 'B', which is still equal to current_char ('B'), so the count remains 0 and current_char remains 'B'.

In the third iteration (i=3), input_char[i] is 'W', which is not equal to current_char ('B'). Therefore, count is incremented by 1 (count becomes 1) and current_char is updated to 'W'.

In the fourth iteration (i=4), input_char[i] is 'W', which is equal to current_char ('W'), so the count remains 1 and current_char remains 'W'.

The loop ends as there are no more characters to check. The program then prints the value of count, which is 1.
