<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "akasaka". The length of the string `n` is 7.
The `left` substring is calculated as `s.substring(0, ((7 + 1) / 2) - 1)` which simplifies to `s.substring(0, 3)` and results in "aka".
The `right` substring is calculated as `s.substring(((7 + 3) / 2) - 1, 7)` which simplifies to `s.substring(4, 7)` and results in "saka".

The `function` method is called three times:
1. With the full string "akasaka". Since the length is odd, it compares "akas" with "akas" (after reversing the second half and including the center character in the first half). They are equal, so it returns true.
2. With the `left` substring "aka". Since the length is odd, it compares "ak" with "ak" (after reversing the second half and including the center character in the first half). They are equal, so it returns true.
3. With the `right` substring "saka". Since the length is even, it compares "sa" with "ka" (after reversing the second half). They are not equal, so it returns false.

Since the `function` method returns false for the `right` substring, the overall condition in the main method is not satisfied, and "No" is printed.
