<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `1 3 3`, which initializes the variables n, d, and x with 1, 3, and 3 respectively.

Two arrays, F and G, are created with a size of 200001 elements each. Both arrays are filled with -1 initially.

The value of F[1] is set to 0.5 and G[1] is set to 1.

A for loop is set to iterate from i = 2 to i = 200000, but since n is 1, the loop does not execute.

The final calculation is performed using the formula `F[n] * x + d * G[n]`. Since n is 1, the formula becomes `F[1] * x + d * G[1]`, which is `0.5 * 3 + 3 * 1`. This simplifies to `1.5 + 3`, resulting in `4.5`.

The output is formatted to display 20 decimal places, so the result `4.5` will be printed with 20 decimal places.
