The input variables N, K, and M are initialized with 2, 2, and 100 respectively according to the input.

The code initializes a 2D array `transit` with dimensions [N+1][N+1] and sets transit[0][0] to 1. This array is used to store the number of ways to use integers up to a certain value, considering the modulus M.

The nested for loops that follow fill the `transit` array. For each pair (i, j) where i is the maximum integer used so far and j is the number of times the current integer is used, the code calculates the number of ways to reach this state. The calculation is done using the previous state (either decrementing i or j) and considering the modulus M.

Next, the code initializes a 2D array `dp` with dimensions [K+1][N+1]. This array is used to store the number of ways to use exactly newVal different integers, considering the modulus M. The first row of `dp` is initialized to 1, as there is only one way to use 0 integers.

The nested for loops that follow fill the `dp` array. For each number of newVal different integers, the code calculates the number of ways to use a certain number of integers (used + use) by adding the number of ways to use fewer integers (dp[newVal - 1][used]) multiplied by the number of ways to transition to the current state (transit[used][use]), considering the modulus M.

Finally, the code prints the value of dp[K][N], which is the number of ways to use exactly K different integers from 1 to N, considering the modulus M.

Let's calculate the values manually:

- transit[0][0] = 1
- transit[0][1] = 1 (1 way to use 0 integers and use the current integer 1 time)
- transit[0][2] = 1 (1 way to use 0 integers and use the current integer 2 times)
- transit[1][0] = 1 (1 way to use 1 integer and use the current integer 0 times)
- transit[1][1] = 2 (2 ways to use 1 integer and use the current integer 1 time)
- transit[2][0] = 1 (1 way to use 2 integers and use the current integer 0 times)

- dp[1][0] = 1 (1 way to use 0 integers with 1 different integer)
- dp[1][1] = 1 (1 way to use 1 integer with 1 different integer)
- dp[1][2] = 1 (1 way to use 2 integers with 1 different integer)

For newVal = 2:
- dp[2][0] = 0 (0 ways to use 0 integers with 2 different integers)
- dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] * transit[0][1] = 1 * 1 = 1 (1 way to use 1 integer with 2 different integers)
- dp[2][2] = dp[1][0] * transit[0][2] + dp[1][1] * transit[1][1] = 1 * 1 + 1 * 2 = 3 (3 ways to use 2 integers with 2 different integers)

The final output is the value of dp[K][N], which is dp[2][2] = 3.
