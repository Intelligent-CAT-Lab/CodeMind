<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `solve` method and a `FastScanner` inner class for fast input reading. The `solve` method is designed to calculate the minimum distance that needs to be moved to align two rectangles on a 1-dimensional line, given their positions and width.

The `main` method creates an instance of `FastScanner` and `PrintWriter`, then calls the `solve` method with these instances, and finally flushes the `PrintWriter`.

The `FastScanner` class provides methods for reading different types of input data. The `ni()` method is used to read an integer, which is what we're interested in for this problem.

Given the input `3 2 6`, the `solve` method is called with these values:
- `W` (width of the moving rectangle) is 3.
- `a` (starting position of the first rectangle) is 2.
- `b` (starting position of the second rectangle) is 6.

The `solve` method calculates the distance between the two rectangles and subtracts the width of the moving rectangle (`W`). If the result is negative, it means the rectangles overlap, and no movement is needed, so the output should be 0. Otherwise, it outputs the positive distance that needs to be moved.

The calculation in `solve` method is as follows:
- `Math.max(a, b)` gives the larger of the two starting positions, which is 6.
- `Math.min(a, b)` gives the smaller of the two starting positions, which is 2.
- The difference between the larger and smaller starting positions is `6 - 2 = 4`.
- Subtracting the width `W` from this difference gives `4 - 3 = 1`.
- Since 1 is greater than 0, the `Math.max` function will return 1.

Therefore, the output will be the minimum distance needed to move the rectangles so that they are aligned, which is 1 unit.
