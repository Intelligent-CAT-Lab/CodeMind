The input is `2`, which is read by the `ExtendedScanner` class and assigned to the variable `n` in the `solve` method.

The `ModArithmetic` class is instantiated with the `MOD1000000007` constant from the `TypicalMods` class, which is `1000000007`.

The `solve` method then calculates the value of `a` using the formula:
```
a = 10^n - 2 * 9^n + 8^n
```
Since `n` is `2`, the calculation becomes:
```
a = 10^2 - 2 * 9^2 + 8^2
a = 100 - 2 * 81 + 64
a = 100 - 162 + 64
a = -62 + 64
a = 2
```
The result `a` is then taken modulo `1000000007` using the `mod` method of the `ModArithmetic` class. Since `2` is already less than `1000000007`, the modulo operation will not change the value.

Finally, the `Out` class writes the result `2` followed by a newline character to the output stream, flushes the stream, and closes it.
