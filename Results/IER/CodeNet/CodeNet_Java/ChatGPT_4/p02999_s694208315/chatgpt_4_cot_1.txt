<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main class with a main method that sets up input and output streams and creates a new instance of a TaskA class. The TaskA class has a method called solve that takes an integer testNumber, a Scanner object in, and a PrintWriter object out as parameters.

The solve method reads two integers X and A using the Scanner object. It then checks if X is less than A. If X is less than A, it prints 0 to the output stream using the PrintWriter object. Otherwise, it prints 10.

Given the input `3 5`, the variables X and A are initialized with 3 and 5, respectively. The if condition checks if 3 is less than 5, which is true. Therefore, the code will print 0 to the output stream.

Finally, the PrintWriter object is closed, which flushes the output to the console.
