<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1118 according to the input.
The code then calculates the individual digits of the number n by using modulo and division operations.
- n1 is the last digit (ones place), which is 8 in this case (1118 % 10).
- n10 is the second last digit (tens place), which is 1 in this case ((1118 - 8) % 100 / 10).
- n100 is the third last digit (hundreds place), which is 1 in this case ((1118 - 8 - 1 * 10) % 1000 / 100).
- n1000 is the first digit (thousands place), which is 1 in this case (1118 / 1000).

The if condition checks if either the last three digits are the same (n1 == n10 && n1 == n100) or the first three digits are the same (n10 == n100 && n10 == n1000). In this case, the first three digits are the same (1 == 1 && 1 == 1), so the condition is true.

Since the condition is true, the program will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
