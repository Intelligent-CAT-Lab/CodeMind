<<<Analysis>>>
The input is read and stored in the variable t as the integer value 725. The code then checks the value of t against a series of if-else conditions to determine the output.

The first condition checks if t is greater than or equal to 1800, which is not true for 725, so it moves to the next condition.

The second condition checks if t is greater than or equal to 1600, which is also not true for 725, so it moves to the next condition.

This process continues until it finds a condition that is true for the value of t. Since 725 is not greater than or equal to 1000, 1200, 1400, or 1600, but it is greater than or equal to 800, the condition `else if (t >= 800)` is true.

Therefore, the code will execute the corresponding `System.out.println(6);` statement, printing the number 6 as the output.
