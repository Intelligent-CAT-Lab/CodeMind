<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `x^2+3x+2` is converted to a character array and processed character by character.

1. The character 'x' sets `xs` to true and `num` to 1 since `num` is 0.
2. The character '^' sets `si` to true and `xs` to false.
3. The character '2' is processed since `si` is true. It converts '2' to integer 2 and sets `keis[2]` to 1 (since `plus` is true and `num` is 1). `si` is set to false.
4. The character '+' sets `plus` to true, and since `xs` is false, it does not modify `keis[1]`.
5. The character '3' updates `num` to 3.
6. The character 'x' sets `xs` to true. Since `num` is 3, it does not change.
7. The character '+' sets `plus` to true, and since `xs` is true, it sets `keis[1]` to 3.
8. `num` is reset to 0.
9. The character '2' updates `num` to 2.

After the loop, since `plus` is true, `keis[0]` is set to 2.

Now, the array `keis` represents the coefficients of the polynomial: `keis[2] = 1`, `keis[1] = 3`, and `keis[0] = 2`.

The code then finds the highest non-zero coefficient, which is at index 2 (`ji` is set to 2).

The code then tries to find the roots of the polynomial by substituting values from 1 to `abs(keis[0])` (which is 2) into the polynomial and checking if the result is 0. It checks both positive and negative values.

For i = 1:
- Positive 1: `1^2 * 1 + 1^1 * 3 + 1^0 * 2 = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6` (not 0)
- Negative 1: `(-1)^2 * 1 + (-1)^1 * 3 + (-1)^0 * 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0` (root found, `ans[1] = -1`)

For i = 2:
- Positive 2: `2^2 * 1 + 2^1 * 3 + 2^0 * 2 = 4 + 6 + 2 = 12` (not 0)
- Negative 2: `(-2)^2 * 1 + (-2)^1 * 3 + (-2)^0 * 2 = 4 - 6 + 2 = 0` (root found, `ans[0] = -2`)

The roots found are -1 and -2. The array `ans` is sorted, but since it's already in ascending order, it remains the same.

Finally, the code constructs a string representation of the factors of the polynomial using the roots found: `(x+1)(x+2)`.
