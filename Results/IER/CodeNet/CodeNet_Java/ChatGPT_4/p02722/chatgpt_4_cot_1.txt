<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `6`. The program starts by reading this input as a long integer `n`.

The `solve` method is called, and it initializes `ans` to 0. It then calls `getPrimeFactors` with `n - 1`, which is `5`. Since `5` is a prime number, the map `primeFactors2` will contain one entry: `{5=1}`.

Next, the program enters a loop to iterate over all numbers `p` from `2` to the square root of `n`. Since `n` is `6`, the loop will consider `p = 2` and `p = 3` (since `3 * 3` is greater than `6`, the loop stops there).

For `p = 2`, `n % p` is `0`, so the program checks if `check(2, 6)` returns `true`. Inside the `check` method, `n` becomes `3` after the first division, and since `3 % 2` is not `1`, the method returns `false`.

For `p = 3`, `n % p` is also `0`, so the program checks if `check(3, 6)` returns `true`. Inside the `check` method, `n` becomes `2` after the first division, and since `2 % 3` is `1`, the method returns `true`. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by `1`.

The loop ends, and the program calculates `a1` by multiplying the values of `entry.getValue() + 1` for each entry in `primeFactors2`. Since there is only one entry with the value `1`, `a1` becomes `1 + 1`, which is `2`.

Finally, the program prints the sum of `a1` and `ans`, which is `2 + 1`, resulting in `3`.
