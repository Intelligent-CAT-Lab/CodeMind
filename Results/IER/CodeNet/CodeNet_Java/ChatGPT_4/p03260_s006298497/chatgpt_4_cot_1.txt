<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, A and B, from the input and assigns them the values 3 and 1 respectively according to the given input. After reading the input, the Scanner object is closed.

The code then checks if neither A nor B is equal to 2. Since A is 3 and B is 1, neither of them is equal to 2. Therefore, the condition of the if statement is true.

Since the condition is true, the code executes the first branch of the if-else statement and prints "Yes" to the standard output.

Finally, the program does not have any more statements to execute, so it will terminate after printing the output.
<<<Output>>>
