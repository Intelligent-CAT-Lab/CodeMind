<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "Thank you for your mail and your lectures" is split into an array of strings `sentence` with each word as an element of the array. The array `sentence` will contain the following elements: ["Thank", "you", "for", "your", "mail", "and", "your", "lectures"].

An integer array `cnt` of the same length as `sentence` is created to keep track of the count of each word in the sentence. Initially, all elements of `cnt` are set to 0.

Two nested for-loops are used to count the occurrences of each word in the sentence. The outer loop iterates through each word in `sentence`, and the inner loop compares each word with every other word in the sentence. If a match is found, the count for that word is incremented in the `cnt` array.

After counting, the code finds the word with the maximum count (`max`) and stores it in `str1`. The word "your" appears twice, so `str1` will be "your".

Next, the code finds the longest word in the sentence by comparing the lengths of each word. The longest word is "lectures", so `str2` will be "lectures".

Finally, the code prints `str1` and `str2` separated by a space.

<<<Output>>>
your lectures
