<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "ASSA" is converted to a character array and assigned to the variable 's'. The array looks like this: ['A', 'S', 'S', 'A'].
The Arrays.sort(s) method sorts the character array in alphabetical order, resulting in the array: ['A', 'A', 'S', 'S'].
The if condition checks if the first two characters are the same (s[0] == s[1]), the last two characters are the same (s[2] == s[3]), and the first two characters are different from the last two characters (s[1] != s[2]).
Since 'A' == 'A', 'S' == 'S', and 'A' != 'S', the condition is true.
Therefore, the program prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
