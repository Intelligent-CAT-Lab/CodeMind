<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "4 3 6" is read and split into an array of strings ["4", "3", "6"]. These strings are then parsed into integers and assigned to the variables overLimit, prevDay, and overDay with the values 4, 3, and 6, respectively.

The code then checks the following conditions:
1. If prevDay is greater than or equal to overDay, it prints "delicious".
2. If prevDay plus overLimit is less than overDay, it prints "dangerous".
3. Otherwise, it prints "safe".

In this case, since prevDay (3) is not greater than or equal to overDay (6), the first condition fails. The second condition checks if prevDay (3) plus overLimit (4) is less than overDay (6), which is also false (3 + 4 = 7, which is not less than 6). Therefore, the second condition also fails.

Since neither of the first two conditions are met, the code proceeds to the else block and prints "safe".

<<<Output>>>
safe
