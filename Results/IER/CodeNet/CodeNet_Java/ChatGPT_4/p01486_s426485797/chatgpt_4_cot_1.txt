<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `mmemewwemeww` is converted to a character array `c` and its length `len` is determined to be 12. The `main` method calls the `check` method with the character array, its length, and an initial pointer value of 0.

The `check` method processes the character array recursively to find a pattern of "mew". It starts with the first character and checks if it is 'm'. If not, it returns -1. If it is 'm', it increments the pointer and checks the next character.

1. The first character is 'm', so the pointer is incremented to 1.
2. The second character is 'm', which is not 'e', so `check` is called recursively with the current pointer value.
3. Inside the recursive call, the first character is 'm', so the pointer is incremented to 2.
4. The second character is 'e', so the pointer is incremented to 3.
5. The third character is 'm', which is not 'w', so `check` is called recursively with the current pointer value.
6. Inside the recursive call, the first character is 'm', so the pointer is incremented to 4.
7. The second character is 'e', so the pointer is incremented to 5.
8. The third character is 'w', so the pointer is incremented to 6 and returned to the previous recursive call.
9. The previous recursive call receives the pointer value 6, increments it to 7, and returns it to the first call of `check`.
10. The first call of `check` receives the pointer value 7, increments it to 8, and checks the next character.
11. The character at pointer 8 is 'e', so the pointer is incremented to 9.
12. The character at pointer 9 is 'w', so the pointer is incremented to 10.
13. The character at pointer 10 is 'e', so the pointer is incremented to 11.
14. The character at pointer 11 is 'w', so the pointer is incremented to 12.

Since the pointer value now equals the length of the character array, the `if` condition in the `main` method is true, and "Cat" is printed.
