<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read from the standard input. It then reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable 'a'. The input provided is `100`, so 'a' will be set to 100. The code then concatenates the string "ABC" with the value of 'a' and prints it to the standard output. Therefore, the output will be "ABC100".
<<<Output>>>
ABC100
