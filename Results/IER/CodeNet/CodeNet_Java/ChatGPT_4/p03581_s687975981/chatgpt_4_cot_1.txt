The input `3 3` initializes the variables `a` and `b` with the values 3 and 3 respectively. The variable `mod` is set to 1000000007, which is used for modulo operations to prevent integer overflow.

The code first creates a 2D array `comb` to store the binomial coefficients. It calculates the binomial coefficients for all pairs (i, j) where 0 <= i <= b and 0 <= j <= i using Pascal's triangle. The modulo operation ensures that the values do not exceed the `mod` value.

Next, the code creates a 2D array `l` to store the sums of binomial coefficients. It iterates over all pairs (i, j) where 0 <= i <= b and 0 <= j <= a. If j is less than or equal to i, it adds the binomial coefficient comb[i][j] to the previous value l[i][j-1] and stores it in l[i][j]. If j is greater than i, it simply copies the previous value l[i][j-1] into l[i][j]. Again, modulo operations are used to keep the values within bounds.

The code then iterates over the array `l` to calculate the cumulative sums along each row.

After that, the code initializes an array `g` to store the final sums for each value from 0 to `a`. It iterates over all values of `i` from 0 to `a` and for each `i`, it calculates the sum of products of binomial coefficients and the corresponding values in `l`. The modulo operation is used after each addition.

Finally, the code calculates the total sum `ans` by adding up all the values in the array `g` and prints the result modulo `mod`.

Let's calculate the values step by step:

1. Calculate binomial coefficients (comb):
   - comb[0][0] = 1
   - comb[1][0] = comb[1][1] = 1
   - comb[2][0] = comb[2][2] = 1, comb[2][1] = 2
   - comb[3][0] = comb[3][3] = 1, comb[3][1] = comb[3][2] = 3

2. Calculate sums of binomial coefficients (l):
   - l[0][0] = 1, l[0][1] = 1, l[0][2] = 1, l[0][3] = 1
   - l[1][0] = 1, l[1][1] = 2, l[1][2] = 2, l[1][3] = 2
   - l[2][0] = 1, l[2][1] = 3, l[2][2] = 5, l[2][3] = 5
   - l[3][0] = 1, l[3][1] = 4, l[3][2] = 7, l[3][3] = 10

3. Calculate cumulative sums along each row (l):
   - l[0][0] = 1, l[0][1] = 2, l[0][2] = 3, l[0][3] = 4
   - l[1][0] = 1, l[1][1] = 3, l[1][2] = 5, l[1][3] = 7
   - l[2][0] = 1, l[2][1] = 4, l[2][2] = 9, l[2][3] = 14
   - l[3][0] = 1, l[3][1] = 5, l[3][2] = 12, l[3][3] = 22

4. Calculate final sums (g):
   - g[0] = 1 (comb[2][0])
   - g[1] = 1 (comb[2][0]) + 3 (comb[2][1] * l[0][0]) = 4
   - g[2] = 1 (comb[2][0]) + 6 (comb[2][1] * l[0][1]) = 7
   - g[3] = 1 (comb[2][0]) + 9 (comb[2][1] * l[0][2]) = 10

5. Calculate total sum (ans):
   - ans = g[
