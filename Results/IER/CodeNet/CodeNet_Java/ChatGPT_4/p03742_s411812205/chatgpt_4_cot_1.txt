<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers from the input, which are 2 and 1, and assigns them to variables x and y, respectively. It initializes the variable ans with -1.

The code then checks the value of y against three different ranges in relation to x:
1. If y is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to x-2, it sets ans to 1.
2. If y is greater than or equal to x-1 and less than or equal to x+1, it sets ans to 0.
3. If y is greater than or equal to x+2, it sets ans to 1.

For the input `2 1`, the second condition is met because y (which is 1) is greater than or equal to x-1 (which is 1) and less than or equal to x+1 (which is 3). Therefore, ans is set to 0.

The code then prints "Alice" if ans is 1, and "Brown" if ans is not 1. Since ans is 0, the output will be "Brown".

Finally, the code closes the BufferedReader and PrintWriter, and exits the program with System.exit(0).
