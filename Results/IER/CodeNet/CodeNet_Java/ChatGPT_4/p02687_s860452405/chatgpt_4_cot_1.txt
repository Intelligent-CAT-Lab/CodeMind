<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads a string 's' using sc.next() method. The input provided is "ABC".

The if statement checks if the string 's' is equal to "ABC". Since the input is indeed "ABC", the condition of the if statement is true. Therefore, the code inside the if block will be executed, which is printing "ARC" to the standard output.

If the input had been any other string than "ABC", the else block would have been executed, printing "ABC" instead. But in this case, since the input is "ABC", the output will be "ARC".
<<<Output>>>
ARC
