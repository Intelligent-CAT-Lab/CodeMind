<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method and a nested `FastScanner` class to read input efficiently. The `main` method reads four long integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using the `FastScanner` class.

Given the input `1 2 1 1`, the variables are initialized as follows:
- `a` is set to 1
- `b` is set to 2
- `c` is set to 1
- `d` is set to 1

The code then calculates four products:
- `p1` is the product of `a` and `c`, which is 1 * 1 = 1
- `p2` is the product of `a` and `d`, which is 1 * 1 = 1
- `p3` is the product of `b` and `c`, which is 2 * 1 = 2
- `p4` is the product of `b` and `d`, which is 2 * 1 = 2

Next, the code finds the maximum of `p1` and `p2`, which is `ans1` and equals 1 (since both `p1` and `p2` are 1).
Then, it finds the maximum of `p3` and `p4`, which is `ans2` and equals 2 (since both `p3` and `p4` are 2).

Finally, the code finds the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, which is `result` and equals 2 (since `ans2` is greater than `ans1`).

The `result` is then printed to the console, which is the maximum product of the pairs of numbers formed by `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
