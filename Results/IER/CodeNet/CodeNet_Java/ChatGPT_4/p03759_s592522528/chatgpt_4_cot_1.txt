<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read from standard input. It then reads three integers a, b, and c with the values 2, 4, and 6 respectively according to the input provided.
The if statement checks whether the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between c and b. In this case, the difference between b and a is 4 - 2 = 2, and the difference between c and b is 6 - 4 = 2.
Since both differences are equal, the condition of the if statement is true, and the code will execute the block that prints "YES" to the standard output.
<<<Output>>>
YES
