<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `a` of size 4 to store integers. It then enters a for loop to read 4 integers from the input using a Scanner object. The input provided is `3 5 2 7`, so the array `a` will be filled with these values in the same order.

After the loop, the array `a` contains the following elements:
a[0] = 3
a[1] = 5
a[2] = 2
a[3] = 7

The code then calculates the maximum of two products: `a[0]*a[1]` and `a[2]*a[3]`. The first product is `3*5` which equals `15`, and the second product is `2*7` which equals `14`.

The `Math.max` function is used to determine the larger of the two products, which in this case is `15`.

Finally, the code prints out the result, which is the larger product `15`.
<<<Output>>>
15
