<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `weeks` is initialized with the value 5 according to the input. The `debtHell` method is called with the initial debt `total` of 100000 and the number of weeks `5`.

The `debtHell` method calculates the new debt for each week by adding 5% of the current debt to the sum. If the 5% yield is a multiple of 1000, it is added directly to the sum. Otherwise, the yield is divided by 1000, rounded up to the nearest integer, and then multiplied by 1000 before being added to the sum.

Let's calculate the debt for each week:
- Week 1: 5% of 100000 is 5000, which is a multiple of 1000, so the new sum is 100000 + 5000 = 105000.
- Week 2: 5% of 105000 is 5250, which is not a multiple of 1000, so the new sum is 105000 + ((int)(5250/1000) + 1) * 1000 = 105000 + 6000 = 111000.
- Week 3: 5% of 111000 is 5550, which is not a multiple of 1000, so the new sum is 111000 + ((int)(5550/1000) + 1) * 1000 = 111000 + 6000 = 117000.
- Week 4: 5% of 117000 is 5850, which is not a multiple of 1000, so the new sum is 117000 + ((int)(5850/1000) + 1) * 1000 = 117000 + 6000 = 123000.
- Week 5: 5% of 123000 is 6150, which is not a multiple of 1000, so the new sum is 123000 + ((int)(6150/1000) + 1) * 1000 = 123000 + 7000 = 130000.

After the loop finishes, the final value of `sum` is 130000, which is printed as the output.
