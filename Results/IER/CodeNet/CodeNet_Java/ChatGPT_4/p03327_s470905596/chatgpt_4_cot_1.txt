<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable n.

The input provided is `999`, so n is set to 999.

Next, the code checks if n is greater than 999. Since n is exactly 999, the condition (n > 999) evaluates to false.

Because the condition is false, the code executes the else block, which prints "ABC" to the standard output.

Therefore, the output of the code with the given input `999` will be "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
