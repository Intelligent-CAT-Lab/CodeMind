<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three integer variables a, b, and c with the values 6, 4, and 3 respectively according to the input. It then checks if the expression c - (a - b) is less than 0. In this case, the expression evaluates to 3 - (6 - 4), which simplifies to 3 - 2, resulting in 1. Since 1 is not less than 0, the condition is false, and the else block is executed. The code then prints the result of the expression c - (a - b), which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
