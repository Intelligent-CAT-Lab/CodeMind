<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `solve` method that takes a `FastScanner` object `in`, a `PrintWriter` object `out`, and a `Methods` object `ms`. The `solve` method reads two double values from the `FastScanner` and calculates their product divided by `3.305785`, then prints the result.

The `main` method creates instances of `Main`, `FastScanner`, `PrintWriter`, and `Methods`. It then calls the `solve` method with these instances and finally closes the `FastScanner` and `PrintWriter`.

The `FastScanner` class is a custom scanner class that reads input from `System.in`. It has methods to read different types of data, including `nextDouble` which is used in this case to read two double values.

Given the input `15 25`, the `solve` method will calculate `15 * 25 / 3.305785`. The result of this calculation is `113.12217194570136`. The `PrintWriter` will then print this result to the standard output, and since there is no formatting specified, it will print the full decimal value as calculated by Java.
