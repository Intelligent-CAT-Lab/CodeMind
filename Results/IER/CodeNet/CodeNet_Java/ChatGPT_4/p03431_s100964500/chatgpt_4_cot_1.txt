The input `2 4` initializes the variables `n` with 2 and `K` with 4. The `mod` variable is set to 998244353, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic in combinatorial calculations.

The `enumFIF` function is called to generate factorials and inverse factorials up to `1000005` modulo `mod`. This is used to calculate combinations efficiently.

The `solve` function then iterates over the range of `one` from `n` to `K` (from 2 to 4 in this case). For each value of `one`, it calculates the balance `bal` as `one - (K-one)`. Depending on the value of `bal`, different cases are considered:

1. If `bal` is greater than or equal to `n`, the combination `C(K, one, mod, fif)` is added to `ans`.
2. If `bal` is greater than 0 but less than `n`, a more complex calculation is performed, which involves calculating a prohibited line and subtracting a combination from `ans`.
3. If `bal` is exactly 0, a specific combination is added to `ans`, and another is subtracted from it.

After the loop, the answer `ans` is taken modulo `mod`, and if it's negative, `mod` is added to make it positive. Finally, the answer is printed.

Let's go through the loop:
- For `one = 2`, `bal = 0`, so the third case applies. The combination `C(2*(4/2)-1, 4/2-1, mod, fif) - C(2*(4/2)-1, 2-2, mod, fif)` is calculated and added to `ans`.
- For `one = 3`, `bal = 1`, which is less than `n`, so the second case applies. The combination `C(4, 3, mod, fif)` is added to `ans`, and then a subtraction is performed if `y` and `x` are non-negative. However, in this case, `y` is negative, so no subtraction occurs.
- For `one = 4`, `bal = 4`, which is greater than or equal to `n`, so the first case applies. The combination `C(4, 4, mod, fif)` is added to `ans`.

The final answer is the sum of these calculations modulo `mod`.

Let's calculate the combinations:
- `C(3, 1, mod, fif)` is the number of ways to choose 1 item from 3, which is 3.
- `C(4, 2, mod, fif)` is the number of ways to choose 2 items from 4, which is 6.
- `C(4, 3, mod, fif)` is the number of ways to choose 3 items from 4, which is 4.
- `C(4, 4, mod, fif)` is the number of ways to choose 4 items from 4, which is 1.

Adding these up: `ans = 3 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 14`. Since `14` is already positive and less than `mod`, no further adjustments are needed.

The output will be `14`.
