<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input. The variable i is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop with the condition i <= n, and in each iteration, i is multiplied by 2. The loop starts with i = 1 and continues as long as i is less than or equal to n.
The iterations of the loop will be as follows:
- First iteration: i = 1 * 2 = 2
- Second iteration: i = 2 * 2 = 4
- Third iteration: i = 4 * 2 = 8

At this point, i (which is now 8) is no longer less than or equal to n (which is 7), so the loop terminates.
After the loop, i is divided by 2, so i = 8 / 2 = 4.
The program then prints the value of i, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
