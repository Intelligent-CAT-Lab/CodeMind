The input is `6`, which is assigned to the variable K. The code initializes an array `dp` of size K (6) and fills it with `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. Then it sets `dp[1]` to 1 and adds 1 to a deque.

The main loop continues until the deque is empty. It polls elements from the deque and calculates two values, `v1` and `v2`, which are `(curr + 1) % K` and `(curr * 10) % K` respectively.

The loop performs the following steps:
1. Polls `1` from the deque (the only element).
2. Calculates `v1 = (1 + 1) % 6 = 2` and `v2 = (1 * 10) % 6 = 4`.
3. Since `dp[2]` and `dp[4]` are greater than `dp[1] + 1` and `dp[1]`, respectively, it sets `dp[2] = 2` and `dp[4] = 1`, and adds `2` to the front and `4` to the end of the deque.

The deque now contains `2` and `4`. The loop continues:

4. Polls `2` from the deque.
5. Calculates `v1 = (2 + 1) % 6 = 3` and `v2 = (2 * 10) % 6 = 2`.
6. Since `dp[3]` is greater than `dp[2] + 1`, it sets `dp[3] = 3`, and adds `3` to the front of the deque. `v2` is not added because `dp[2]` is not greater than `dp[2]`.

The deque now contains `3` and `4`. The loop continues:

7. Polls `3` from the deque.
8. Calculates `v1 = (3 + 1) % 6 = 4` and `v2 = (3 * 10) % 6 = 0`.
9. Since `dp[4]` is not greater than `dp[3] + 1`, it does not update `dp[4]`. Since `dp[0]` is greater than `dp[3]`, it sets `dp[0] = 3`, and adds `0` to the end of the deque.

The deque now contains `4` and `0`. The loop continues:

10. Polls `4` from the deque.
11. Calculates `v1 = (4 + 1) % 6 = 5` and `v2 = (4 * 10) % 6 = 4`.
12. Since `dp[5]` is greater than `dp[4] + 1`, it sets `dp[5] = 2`, and adds `5` to the front of the deque. `v2` is not added because `dp[4]` is not greater than `dp[4]`.

The deque now contains `5` and `0`. The loop continues:

13. Polls `5` from the deque.
14. Calculates `v1 = (5 + 1) % 6 = 0` and `v2 = (5 * 10) % 6 = 2`.
15. Since `dp[0]` is not greater than `dp[5] + 1`, it does not update `dp[0]`. Since `dp[2]` is not greater than `dp[5]`, it does not update `dp[2]`.

The deque now contains only `0`. The loop continues:

16. Polls `0` from the deque.
17. Calculates `v1 = (0 + 1) % 6 = 1` and `v2 = (0 * 10) % 6 = 0`.
18. Since `dp[1]` is not greater than `dp[0] + 1`, it does not update `dp[1]`. `v2` is not added because `dp[0]` is not greater than `dp[0]`.

The deque is now empty, so the loop ends. The final `dp` array is `[3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]`.

The program prints `dp[0]`, which is `3`.
