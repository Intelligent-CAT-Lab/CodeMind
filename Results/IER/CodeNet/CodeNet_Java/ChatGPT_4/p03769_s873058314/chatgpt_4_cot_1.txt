<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that starts a new thread to run a `TaskAdapter`. The `TaskAdapter` creates instances of `FastInput` and `FastOutput` to read from `System.in` and write to `System.out`. It then creates an instance of `TaskC` and calls its `solve` method.

The `solve` method of `TaskC` reads a long integer `n` from the input, which is `7` in this case. It then creates an `IntList` (a custom dynamic array implementation) and enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than `0`.

Inside the while loop, it uses a for loop to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. It does this by checking if `n` is less than `2` raised to the power of `i + 1` for each `i` starting from `0`. When it finds such an `i`, it breaks out of the loop.

After finding `i`, it subtracts `2^i` from `n` and inserts the value `list.size() + 1` at the `i`-th position of the `IntList`. This process repeats until `n` becomes `0`.

For the input `7`, the following steps occur:
1. `n` starts at `7`. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to `7` is `4` (`2^2`), so `i` is `2`. `n` becomes `7 - 4 = 3`. The list size is `0`, so `1` is inserted at index `2`, which just adds `1` to the list.
2. `n` is now `3`. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to `3` is `2` (`2^1`), so `i` is `1`. `n` becomes `3 - 2 = 1`. The list size is `1`, so `2` is inserted at index `1`, making the list `[1, 2]`.
3. `n` is now `1`. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to `1` is `1` (`2^0`), so `i` is `0`. `n` becomes `1 - 1 = 0`. The list size is `2`, so `3` is inserted at index `0`, making the list `[3, 1, 2]`.

After the while loop, the `solve` method prints the size of the list multiplied by `2`, which is `3 * 2 = 6`. Then it prints the numbers from `1` to `list.size()` (which is `1 2 3`), followed by the elements of the list (`3 1 2`).
