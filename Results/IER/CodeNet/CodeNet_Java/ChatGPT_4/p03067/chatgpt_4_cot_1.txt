<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that sets up an `InputReader` to read from `System.in` and an `OutputWriter` to write to `System.out`. It then creates an instance of `AOnTheWay` and calls its `solve` method.

The `solve` method reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using the `InputReader`'s `ni()` method. It then checks if `c` is between `a` and `b` or `b` and `a` (inclusive). If `c` is within the range, it prints "Yes" using the `OutputWriter`, otherwise it prints "No".

Given the input `3 8 5`, the `solve` method will read `a = 3`, `b = 8`, and `c = 5`. Since `c` is between `a` and `b`, the condition `(c >= a && c <= b) || (c >= b && c <= a)` evaluates to true, and the method will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
