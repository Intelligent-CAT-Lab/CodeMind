<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input. The array ans is initialized with the strings "Positive", "Negative", "Zero".
The variable tmp is calculated as the product of a and b, which is 1 * 3 = 3.
Since tmp is greater than 0, the condition (tmp <= 0) is false, and the code does not enter the if block that sets an to 2.
The next condition checks if a is less than 0, which is also false since a is 1. Therefore, the code does not enter the inner if block that could potentially set an to 1.
Since none of the conditions to change the value of an are met, an remains 0.
Finally, the program prints the string at index 0 of the ans array, which is "Positive".
<<<Output>>>
Positive
