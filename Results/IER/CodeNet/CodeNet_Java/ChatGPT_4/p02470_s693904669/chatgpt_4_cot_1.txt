The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 6 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the variable cnt to 0. Then it enters a while loop to check if n is divisible by i. If it is, it increments cnt and divides n by i.
For i = 2, n is divisible by 2, so cnt becomes 1 and n becomes 3. Since n is no longer divisible by 2, the while loop ends.
Since cnt is greater than 0, ans is updated to ans * (i^cnt - i^(cnt-1)). This is ans * (2^1 - 2^0) = 1 * (2 - 1) = 1 * 1 = 1.
For i = 3, n is divisible by 3, so cnt becomes 1 and n becomes 1. Since n is no longer divisible by 3, the while loop ends.
Since cnt is greater than 0, ans is updated to ans * (i^cnt - i^(cnt-1)). This is ans * (3^1 - 3^0) = 1 * (3 - 1) = 1 * 2 = 2.
For i = 4, 5, and 6, n is not divisible by any of these, so cnt remains 0 and ans is not updated.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output, which is 2.
