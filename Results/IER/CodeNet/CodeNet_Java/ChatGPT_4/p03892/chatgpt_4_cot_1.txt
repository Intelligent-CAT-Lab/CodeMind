The input provided is `1 1 3 4`. The `solve` method is called from the `main` method without any arguments.

1. The `ni()` method is called four times to read four integers from the input. The first two calls set `a` and `b` to 1 each. The third call updates `a` to `Math.abs(3 - 1)`, which is 2. The fourth call updates `b` to `Math.abs(4 - 1)`, which is 3.

2. The `gcd` method is called with `a` and `b` as arguments, which are now 2 and 3, respectively. Since `b` is not 0, the method calls itself with `b` and `a % b` as new arguments, which are 3 and 2 % 3 (which is 2). In the next recursive call, `a` is 3 and `b` is 2, and since `b` is not 0, it calls itself again with `b` and `a % b`, which are 2 and 3 % 2 (which is 1). In the next recursive call, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1, and since `b` is not 0, it calls itself again with `b` and `a % b`, which are 1 and 2 % 1 (which is 0). Now `b` is 0, so the method returns `a`, which is 1. This is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original `a` and `b`.

3. The `ans` variable is calculated as `a/g + b/g - 1`, which is `2/1 + 3/1 - 1`, resulting in `4`.

4. The final output is printed as `ans * g`, which is `4 * 1`, resulting in `4`.

5. The `out.flush()` method is called to ensure that the output is written out.

Therefore, the output of the code execution is `4`.
