<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `main` method that takes a string input representing a day of the week and prints out the number of days until Sunday. The list `list` contains the days of the week from "SUN" to "SAT". The `nstr()` method is used to read the next token from the input, which is expected to be one of the days of the week.

The input provided is "SAT". The `nstr()` method reads this input and assigns it to the string variable `s`. The `indexOf` method is then called on the `list` to find the index of "SAT", which is 6 (since the index is 0-based). The program then calculates `7 - list.indexOf(s)`, which is `7 - 6 = 1`.

Therefore, the output will be the number of days until Sunday from Saturday, which is 1.
