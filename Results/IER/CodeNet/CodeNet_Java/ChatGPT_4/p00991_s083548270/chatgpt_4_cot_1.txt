<<<Analysis>>>
The input initializes the variables r and c with 4, representing the dimensions of a grid. The variables a1, a2, b1, and b2 are initialized with 0, 0, 3, and 3 respectively, representing the starting point (a1, a2) and the ending point (b1, b2) on the grid.

The variables b1_ and b2_ are calculated as the absolute differences between the starting and ending points' coordinates, resulting in b1_ = 3 and b2_ = 3.

The variable pow is initialized with 1. Since b1_ equals r - b1_ and b2_ equals c - b2_, the value of pow is multiplied by 2 twice, resulting in pow = 4.

The variables b1_ and b2_ are then updated to be the minimum between their current values and the differences from the grid's dimensions, but since b1_ and b2_ are already equal to r - b1_ and c - b2_, they remain unchanged at 3.

A 2D array dp of size r by c is created to store the number of ways to reach each cell in the grid from the starting point (0, 0) using only right and down moves.

The nested for loops fill the dp array with the number of ways to reach each cell. The base case is dp[0][0] = 1, as there is only one way to stay at the starting point. For the first row and first column, the number of ways is the same as the previous cell since there is only one way to move right or down. For other cells, the number of ways is the sum of the ways to reach the cell from the left (dp[i][j-1]) and the cell above (dp[i-1][j]), modulo 100000007 to avoid large numbers.

After filling the dp array, the output is calculated as (dp[b1_][b2_] * pow) % 100000007. The value at dp[3][3] is the number of ways to reach the cell (3, 3) from (0, 0), which is 10. Multiplying this by pow (4) and taking modulo 100000007 gives the final result.
