<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that sets up input and output streams, creates instances of `LightScanner` and `LightWriter`, and then calls the `solve` method of the `NTL_2_E` class.

The `solve` method of `NTL_2_E` class reads two big integers using the `bigints` method of the `LightScanner` class. The `bigints` method reads a string from the input and converts it into a `BigInteger`.

The input provided is `5 8`. The `LightScanner` reads these two numbers as big integers. The `solve` method then calculates the remainder of the division of the first big integer by the second big integer using the `remainder` method of the `BigInteger` class. In this case, it calculates `5 % 8`.

Since 5 is less than 8, the remainder of dividing 5 by 8 is 5.

The `LightWriter` class is used to write the output. The `ansln` method of `LightWriter` is called with the string representation of the remainder, which is then followed by a newline character due to the `ln` method call.

Therefore, the output will be the remainder of the division of 5 by 8, which is 5, followed by a newline character.
