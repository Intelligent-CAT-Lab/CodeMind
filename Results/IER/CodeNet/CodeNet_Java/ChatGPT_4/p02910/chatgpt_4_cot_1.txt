<<<Analysis>>>
The input string N is initialized with "RUDLUDR". The program enters a for loop that iterates over each character of the string.

1. i = 0 (even), c = 'R' - No condition is met, continue.
2. i = 1 (odd), c = 'U' - No condition is met, continue.
3. i = 2 (even), c = 'D' - No condition is met, continue.
4. i = 3 (odd), c = 'L' - The condition (c == 'R') is not met, continue.
5. i = 4 (even), c = 'U' - No condition is met, continue.
6. i = 5 (odd), c = 'D' - No condition is met, continue.
7. i = 6 (even), c = 'R' - No condition is met, continue.

Since the loop completes without breaking, the last if condition (i == N.length() - 1) is met, and "Yes" is printed.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
