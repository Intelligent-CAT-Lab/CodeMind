<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "ABC" is read and assigned to the variable S. The program enters the while loop since the length of S is exactly 3, which is not greater than 3, so the while loop is not executed.

The program then checks if S equals "ABC". Since S is indeed "ABC", the program prints "Yes" and terminates.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
