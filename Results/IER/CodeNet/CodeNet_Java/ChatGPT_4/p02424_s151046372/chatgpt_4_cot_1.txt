<<<Analysis>>>
The input values for x and y are 8 and 10 respectively. The binary representations of these numbers are:
- 8 in binary: 1000
- 10 in binary: 1010

The code performs three bitwise operations on x and y: AND (&), OR (|), and XOR (^).

1. AND operation (x & y):
   - 1000 (8 in binary)
   AND
   - 1010 (10 in binary)
   Results in:
   - 1000 (8 in binary)

2. OR operation (x | y):
   - 1000 (8 in binary)
   OR
   - 1010 (10 in binary)
   Results in:
   - 1010 (10 in binary)

3. XOR operation (x ^ y):
   - 1000 (8 in binary)
   XOR
   - 1010 (10 in binary)
   Results in:
   - 0010 (2 in binary)

For each operation, the code formats the result to a 32-bit binary string with leading zeros and then prints the last 32 characters of the string.

The expected output will be the 32-bit binary representations of the numbers 8, 10, and 2, with leading zeros to fill the 32-bit format.
