<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, n and r, from the input. According to the given input, n is assigned the value 2 and r is assigned the value 2919.

The code then checks if n is less than 10. Since n is 2, which is indeed less than 10, the condition is true. Therefore, the code inside the if block is executed.

Inside the if block, the code calculates the value to be printed by adding r to the product of (10 - n) and 100. The calculation is as follows:
r + (10 - n) * 100
= 2919 + (10 - 2) * 100
= 2919 + 8 * 100
= 2919 + 800
= 3719

The result of this calculation, 3719, is then printed to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
3719
