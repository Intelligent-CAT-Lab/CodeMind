<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, m, and d are initialized with 2, 3, and 1 respectively according to the input.
The code then calculates the value of variable s using a ternary operator. Since d is not equal to 0, the second part of the ternary operator is executed: ((n - d) * 2), which results in ((2 - 1) * 2) = 2.
Next, the code prints the result of the expression (double) s/n/n*(m-1). Substituting the values of s, n, and m, we get (double) 2/2/2*(3-1), which simplifies to (double) 1/2*2, which is 1.0.
Therefore, the output will be 1.0.
