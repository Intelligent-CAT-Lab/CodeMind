<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single line of input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The input string is `happy,newyear,enjoy`. The `replace` method is then called on this string, which replaces all occurrences of the comma `,` with a space `" "`. The resulting string is then printed to the console. Therefore, the output will be the input string with commas replaced by spaces.
<<<Output>>>
happy newyear enjoy
