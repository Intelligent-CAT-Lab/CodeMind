<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `2`. The `InputReader` class reads this input and the `nextInt()` method processes it. Since the input is divided by 2 in the `solve` method, `n` becomes 1.

The `solve` method initializes `res` with 7, `p2` with 8, `num` with 1, and `den` with 2. It then enters a for loop that will iterate only once because `n` is 1.

Inside the loop, `res` is multiplied by 9, but since `i` is 1, the condition `if (i > 1)` is not satisfied, so the code inside this if block is not executed.

The loop ends after one iteration, and the final value of `res` is `7 * 9 = 63`. Since `res` is not modified further and `mod` is 998244353, which is much larger than 63, there is no need to apply the modulo operation.

Finally, the `OutputWriter` class's `printLine` method is called to print the result, which is 63.

<<<Output>>>
63
