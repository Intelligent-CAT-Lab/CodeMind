<<<Analysis>>>
The input `0 2015` indicates that the first integer `e` is `0` which corresponds to the "seireki" era, and the second integer `y` is `2015`. The `solve` method is called with these values.

Inside the `solve` method, the following steps occur:
1. Since `e` is `0`, the first `if` condition is true, and the code enters the first block.
2. The code then checks which era the year 2015 falls into. Since 2015 is greater than 1988, it falls into the "heisei" era.
3. The code calculates the year in the "heisei" era by subtracting the start year of the "heisei" era (1988) from the given year (2015), resulting in `2015 - 1988 = 27`.
4. The result is then printed with an "H" prefix, indicating the "heisei" era.

Therefore, the output will be "H27".
