<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers r, g, and b from the input, which are 4, 3, and 2 respectively. It then concatenates the string representations of g and b to form a new string "32". This string is then converted back to an integer k, which is 32.

The code checks if k is divisible by 4. Since 32 is divisible by 4 (32 % 4 equals 0), the condition is true.

Therefore, the code will print "YES" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
YES
