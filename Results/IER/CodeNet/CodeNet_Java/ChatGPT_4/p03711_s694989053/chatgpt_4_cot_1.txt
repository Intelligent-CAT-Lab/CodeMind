<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner to read from standard input. It then declares two integer variables x and y, and two integer arrays A and B, which represent months of the year that fall into different groups based on the number of days they have. Array A contains months with 31 days, and array B contains months with 30 days. Two String variables Xans and Yans are also declared to store the group of the input months.

The input is read as two integers, which are assigned to x and y. According to the input, x is assigned the value 1 and y is assigned the value 3.

The code then iterates over array A to check if x or y matches any of the elements in A. If a match is found, Xans or Yans is set to "A". Since 1 and 3 are both in array A, both Xans and Yans are set to "A".

The code then iterates over array B to check if x or y matches any of the elements in B. Since neither 1 nor 3 is in array B, Xans and Yans remain "A".

The code then checks if x or y is equal to 2, and if so, sets Xans or Yans to "C". Since neither x nor y is 2, Xans and Yans remain "A".

Finally, the code checks if Xans is equal to Yans. Since both are "A", the condition is true, and the code prints "Yes".
