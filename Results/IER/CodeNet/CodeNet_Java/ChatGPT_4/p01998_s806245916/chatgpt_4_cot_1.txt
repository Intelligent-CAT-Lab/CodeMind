<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `3`, which initializes the variable `n` with the value 3. The `solve` method is called with `in`, `out`, and `ms` as arguments.

The `solve` method initializes `ans` to 0 and starts a for loop with `i` starting at 3 and incrementing by 2 each time, running until `i` is greater than `n`. Since `n` is 3, the loop will only consider the value `i = 3`.

Inside the loop, the method `ms.isPrime(i)` is called to check if `i` is a prime number. Since `i` is 3, which is a prime number, the method returns `true`. Then `ms.isPrime(i+2)` is called to check if `i+2` (which is 5) is a prime number. Since 5 is also a prime number, the method returns `true`.

Because both `ms.isPrime(i)` and `ms.isPrime(i+2)` return `true`, `ans` is incremented by 2.

After the loop, the final value of `ans` is printed, which is 2.
