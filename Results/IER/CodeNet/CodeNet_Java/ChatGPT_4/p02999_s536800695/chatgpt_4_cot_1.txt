<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, x and a, from the input.

The input provided is `3 5`, so x is initialized with the value 3 and a is initialized with the value 5.

The code then checks if x is less than a using an if-else statement. Since 3 is indeed less than 5, the condition (x < a) evaluates to true.

As a result, the code inside the if block is executed, which prints "0" to the standard output.

The else block is ignored because the condition was true, and the program does not execute the code inside the else block.

Finally, the program ends after printing the output.
