The variable n is initialized with 5 and variable l is initialized with 2 according to the input.

A List of Integer type named diff is created to store the absolute values of the numbers generated by the formula l+i-1 for each i from 1 to n (inclusive).

The for loop iterates 5 times (since n is 5), with i taking values from 1 to 5. In each iteration, it calculates the value of l+i-1, which results in the following sequence: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Since none of these values are negative, the if condition is not executed, and the absolute values are the same as the original values.

These values are added to the diff list, so diff becomes [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

The Collections.min(diff) finds the minimum value in the diff list, which is 2. The indexOf method finds the index of this minimum value, which is 0 (since list indices start at 0). Therefore, removeK is 0 + 1, which equals 1.

The final output is calculated using the formula n*l + n*(n+1)/2 - n - (l+ removeK -1). Plugging in the values, we get:

5*2 + 5*(5+1)/2 - 5 - (2+ 1 -1)
= 10 + 5*6/2 - 5 - 2
= 10 + 15 - 5 - 2
= 25 - 7
= 18

So the output of the code execution will be 18.
