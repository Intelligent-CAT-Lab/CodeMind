<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized with 10, 9, 10, and 10 respectively according to the input.
The while loop will continue to execute as long as both a and c are greater than 0.
In the first iteration of the while loop:
- a is reduced by d (10 - 10 = 0)
- c is reduced by b (10 - 9 = 1)

After the first iteration, a is 0 and c is 1. Since a is no longer greater than 0, the while loop terminates.

The if statement checks if c is greater than 0, which it is (c is 1), so the program prints "No".

<<<Output>>>
No
