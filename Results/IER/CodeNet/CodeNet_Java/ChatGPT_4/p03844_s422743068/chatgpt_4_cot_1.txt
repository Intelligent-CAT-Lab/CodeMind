<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in).
It then reads an integer value into variable 'a', which is 1 according to the input.
Next, it reads a string into variable 'op', which is "+" according to the input.
After that, it reads another integer value into variable 'b', which is 2 according to the input.
The code then checks if the value of 'op' is equal to the string "+". Since 'op' is "+", the condition is true.
As the condition is true, it executes the code inside the if block, which calculates the sum of 'a' and 'b' (1 + 2) and prints the result.
Therefore, the output will be the result of the addition, which is 3.
