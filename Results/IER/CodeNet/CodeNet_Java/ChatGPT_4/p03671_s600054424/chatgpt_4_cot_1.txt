<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c with values 700, 600, and 780 respectively. It then initializes a variable result to 0.

The calculation part of the code adds the values of a, b, and c, and then subtracts the maximum value among them. The max function is used twice to determine the maximum value between a, b, and c. The maximum value among the three integers is 780.

The result of the calculation is:
result = a + b + c - max(a, max(b, c))
result = 700 + 600 + 780 - 780
result = 2080 - 780
result = 1300

Finally, the code prints the value of result, which is 1300.

<<<Output>>>
1300
