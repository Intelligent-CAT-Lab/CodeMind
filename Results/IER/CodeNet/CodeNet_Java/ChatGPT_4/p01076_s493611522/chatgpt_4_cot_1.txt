<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and D are initialized with 4 and 3 respectively according to the input. The variable ans is declared but not initialized.
Since D is not equal to 1, the else block is executed.
Inside the else block, a new variable dense is calculated as N - D, which is 4 - 3 = 1.
Then ans is calculated as follows:
- ans = dense * (dense - 1) / 2, which is 1 * (1 - 1) / 2 = 0.
- ans += 2 * dense, which is 0 + 2 * 1 = 2.
- ans += D - 2, which is 2 + 3 - 2 = 3.
The final value of ans is 3.
The program then prints the value of ans.
