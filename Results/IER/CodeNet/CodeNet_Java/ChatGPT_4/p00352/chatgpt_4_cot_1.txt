<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using a Scanner object. The input provided is `1000 3000`. The two integers are read by calling `sc.nextInt()` twice, which will assign 1000 to the first call and 3000 to the second call. These two values are then added together, resulting in 4000. The sum (4000) is then divided by 2, which results in 2000. The result of this division is then printed to the console. Therefore, the output will be 2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000
