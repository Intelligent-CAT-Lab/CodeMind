<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three strings as input: "rng", "gorilla", and "apple". It then checks if the last character of the first string ('g') is the same as the first character of the second string ('g'), and if the last character of the second string ('a') is the same as the first character of the third string ('a'). Since both conditions are true, the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
