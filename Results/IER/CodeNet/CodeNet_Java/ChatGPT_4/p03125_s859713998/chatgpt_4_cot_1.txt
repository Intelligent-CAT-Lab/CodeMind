<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two integer variables, a and b, with the values 4 and 12 respectively, according to the input. It then evaluates the expression `(b % a == 0) ? a + b : b - a`. This is a ternary operator that checks if b is divisible by a without any remainder. If it is, the result of `a + b` is returned; otherwise, the result of `b - a` is returned.

In this case, since 12 is divisible by 4, the condition `b % a == 0` is true. Therefore, the expression `a + b` is evaluated, which is `4 + 12`. The result of this expression is 16.

The code then prints the result of the ternary operation, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
