The input provided is `2 2 2`, which corresponds to the variables zeroes, ones, and k being initialized with the values 2, 2, and 2 respectively.

The variable depth is calculated as (zeroes + ones - 1) / (k - 1), which in this case is (2 + 2 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 3 / 1 = 3.

An array ways of size ones + 1 (which is 3) is created and initialized with all zeros except for ways[0] which is set to 1.

A long variable res is initialized to 0, and a boolean array nice of size ones + 1 (which is 3) is created and initialized with all false.

A for loop starts with i ranging from 1 to depth (inclusive), so it will iterate 3 times.

Inside the for loop, the nice array is reset to all false on each iteration.

Another for loop starts with extra ranging from 0 to depth - i (inclusive). For each extra, it calculates now as ones - extra * (k - 1). If now is non-negative, nice[now] is set to true. Since k is 2, the inner loop will run only once for each i, setting nice[ones] to true.

After that, a nested for loop starts with old ranging from ones down to 0. If ways[old] is not 0, another for loop starts with cur ranging from 1 to k - 1 (which is 1 in this case) and old + cur <= ones. If nice[old + cur] is true, res is incremented by ways[old] and ways[old + cur] is incremented by ways[old], with both being taken modulo MODULO if they exceed it.

Since k is 2, the innermost loop will run only once for each old, and since nice[ones] is true, res will be incremented by ways[old] for old = 0, 1, and 2, and ways[1] and ways[2] will be incremented by ways[0] and ways[1] respectively.

After the first iteration of the outermost loop, ways[1] will be 1 and res will be 1. After the second iteration, ways[2] will be incremented by ways[1] (which is 1), so ways[2] will be 1 and res will be incremented by ways[1] again, making res 2. After the third iteration, res will be incremented by ways[2] (which is 1), making the final res 3.

Finally, the result res, which is 3, is printed out.
