<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "1111". The length of the string `l` is 4.

The first if condition checks if the first character is '0' or the last character is '1'. Since the first character is '1' and the last character is '1', the condition is not met, and the program does not return -1.

Next, the program enters a for loop that runs from 0 to l/2 (which is 2 in this case). It checks if the characters at positions `i` and `l-i-2` are different. Since the input string is "1111", all characters are the same, and the condition `c[i]!=c[l-i-2]` is never true.

After the loop, the program prints "1 2" followed by a newline.

Then, it enters another for loop with `i` starting from 3 and `s` starting from 2. The loop runs until `i` is less than or equal to `l` (which is 4). Inside the loop, it prints "s i" where `s` is 2 initially and `i` is the current loop index. It then checks if the character at position `i-2` is '1'. If it is, it updates `s` to be the current value of `i`.

Since all characters in the input string are '1', `s` will be updated on each iteration. The output will be "2 3" on the first iteration and "3 4" on the second iteration.

The program flushes the output after printing.
