<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads a long integer value into the variable n.

The input provided is `3`. The variable n is initialized with the value 3.

Next, the code checks if n is an odd number by using the modulo operator. Since 3 % 2 is equal to 1, which is not equal to 0, the condition (n % 2 != 0) is true. Therefore, the code enters the if block.

Inside the if block, n is multiplied by 2. So, n becomes 3 * 2, which is 6.

Finally, the code prints the value of n, which is now 6.

<<<Output>>>
6
