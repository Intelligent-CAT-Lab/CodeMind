<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized with 10, 30, and 20 respectively according to the input. The variable sum is then calculated as the sum of a, b, and c, which is 10 + 30 + 20 = 60.

Next, the variable discr (discriminant) is calculated as follows:
discr = (2 * a - sum) * (2 * b - sum) * (2 * c - sum)
       = (2 * 10 - 60) * (2 * 30 - 60) * (2 * 20 - 60)
       = (-40) * (0) * (-20)
       = 0 (since any number multiplied by 0 is 0)

Since discr is equal to 0, the condition in the if statement is true, and "Yes" will be printed to the console.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
