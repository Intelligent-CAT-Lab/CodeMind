<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 6 and variable d is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it increments ans by 1 and then decreases n by 1 + 2*d (which is 1 + 2*2 = 5 in this case).
The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: n = 6 - 5 = 1, ans = 1
- Second iteration: n = 1 - 5 = -4 (loop ends because n is no longer greater than 0)

The loop runs a total of 2 times before n is no longer greater than 0.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output, which is 2.
