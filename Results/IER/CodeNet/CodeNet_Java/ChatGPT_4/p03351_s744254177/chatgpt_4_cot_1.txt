<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized with 4, 7, 9, and 3 respectively according to the input.

The if condition checks two scenarios using the logical OR operator (||):

1. It checks if the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to d. In this case, Math.abs(4-9) is 5, which is not less than or equal to 3. So, this condition is false.

2. It checks if both the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to d AND the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to d. In this case, Math.abs(4-7) is 3, which is less than or equal to 3, and Math.abs(7-9) is 2, which is also less than or equal to 3. So, this condition is true.

Since one of the conditions in the OR statement is true, the overall if condition is true, and the program will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
