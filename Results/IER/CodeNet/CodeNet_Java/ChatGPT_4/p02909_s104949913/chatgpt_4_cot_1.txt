<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads a single word from the input, which is expected to be "Sunny" according to the given input.

A HashMap named `map` is created to store String key-value pairs. Three pairs are put into the map:
- "Sunny" maps to "Cloudy"
- "Cloudy" maps to "Rainy"
- "Rainy" maps to "Sunny"

The code then retrieves the value associated with the key "Sunny" from the map, which is "Cloudy", and prints it to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
Cloudy
