<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `1`, which means the Koch curve will be drawn with one level of recursion.

The main method initializes a Scanner to read the input, which is `1`, and assigns it to the variable `n`. It then creates two Tuple objects, `a` and `b`, representing the start and end points of the Koch curve, with coordinates (0.0, 0.0) and (100.0, 0.0) respectively.

The `a.print()` method is called, printing the coordinates of point `a`. Then, the `koch` method is called with `n`, `a`, and `b` as arguments.

Inside the `koch` method, since `n` is not `0`, it proceeds to calculate the points `s`, `t`, and `u` which are required to draw the Koch curve.

- Point `s` is calculated as the point that lies 1/3 of the way from `a` to `b`.
- Point `t` is calculated as the point that lies 2/3 of the way from `a` to `b`.
- Point `u` is calculated using the coordinates of `s` and `t` to find the point that forms an equilateral triangle with `s` and `t` as the base.

The `koch` method is then called recursively with `n-1` (which is `0`), and points `a` and `s`. Since `n` is `0`, this call returns immediately without doing anything.

The `s.print()` method is called, printing the coordinates of point `s`.

The `koch` method is called recursively with `n-1` (which is `0`), and points `s` and `u`. Since `n` is `0`, this call returns immediately without doing anything.

The `u.print()` method is called, printing the coordinates of point `u`.

The `koch` method is called recursively with `n-1` (which is `0`), and points `u` and `t`. Since `n` is `0`, this call returns immediately without doing anything.

The `t.print()` method is called, printing the coordinates of point `t`.

The `koch` method is called recursively with `n-1` (which is `0`), and points `t` and `b`. Since `n` is `0`, this call returns immediately without doing anything.

Finally, the `b.print()` method is called from the main method, printing the coordinates of point `b`.

The output will be the coordinates of points `a`, `s`, `u`, `t`, and `b` in that order, each on a new line.
