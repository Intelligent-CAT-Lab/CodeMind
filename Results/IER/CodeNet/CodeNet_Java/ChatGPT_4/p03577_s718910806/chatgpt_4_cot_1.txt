<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single string input using a Scanner object. The input string is "CODEFESTIVAL".
The code then uses the substring method to create a new string that starts from the beginning of the input string (index 0) and ends 8 characters before the end of the input string. The length of the input string "CODEFESTIVAL" is 12 characters.
Subtracting 8 from the total length (12) gives us 4, so the substring method will create a new string from index 0 to index 4 (exclusive).
The substring method in Java is zero-indexed and the end index is exclusive, which means the resulting substring will include the characters at indices 0, 1, 2, and 3.
The characters at these indices are "C", "O", "D", and "E" respectively.
Therefore, the output will be the concatenation of these characters, which is "CODE".
