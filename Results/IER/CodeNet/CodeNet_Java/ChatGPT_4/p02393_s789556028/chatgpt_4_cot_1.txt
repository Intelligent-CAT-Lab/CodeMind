The code initializes an array `num` of size 3 and two integer variables `max` and `ind` with 0. It then enters a for loop to read 3 integers from the input.

1. In the first iteration of the loop, `num[0]` is set to 3. Since 3 is greater than `max` (which is 0), `max` is updated to 3 and `ind` is updated to 0.
2. In the second iteration, `num[1]` is set to 8. Since 8 is greater than `max` (which is 3), `max` is updated to 8 and `ind` is updated to 1.
3. In the third iteration, `num[2]` is set to 1. Since 1 is not greater than `max` (which is 8), `max` and `ind` remain unchanged.

After the loop, the code checks if the index of the maximum number (`ind`) is not 2. Since `ind` is 1, the condition is true. It then swaps the values of `num[2]` and `num[ind]` (which is `num[1]`). After the swap, the array `num` is `[3, 1, 8]`.

Next, the code checks if `num[0]` is greater than `num[1]`. Since 3 is greater than 1, it swaps `num[0]` and `num[1]`. After the swap, the array `num` is `[1, 3, 8]`.

Finally, the code prints the elements of the array `num` in order, resulting in the output "1 3 8".
