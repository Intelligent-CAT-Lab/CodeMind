<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `solve` method that takes a `FastScanner` object, a `PrintWriter` object, and a `Methods` object as parameters. The `solve` method reads four integers `h`, `w`, `x`, and `y` using the `FastScanner` object and then prints "Yes" or "No" based on the condition `((h*w)%2!=0 && (x+y)%2!=0)`. If the condition is true, it prints "No", otherwise it prints "Yes".

The `FastScanner` class is a custom scanner class that reads input from the `System.in` InputStream. It provides methods to read different types of data, such as `nextInt`, `nextLong`, `nextDouble`, etc.

The `Methods` class contains utility methods, but none of these methods are used in the `solve` method for this particular problem.

Given the input `3 5 1 4`, the `solve` method will perform the following steps:
1. Read `h` as 3, `w` as 5, `x` as 1, and `y` as 4.
2. Calculate the product of `h` and `w`, which is 3 * 5 = 15.
3. Check if the product (15) is odd, which it is because 15 % 2 != 0.
4. Calculate the sum of `x` and `y`, which is 1 + 4 = 5.
5. Check if the sum (5) is odd, which it is because 5 % 2 != 0.
6. Since both the product of `h` and `w` and the sum of `x` and `y` are odd, the condition is true, and the method will print "No".

Therefore, the output will be "No".
