<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads an integer value and assigns it to the variable h. The input provided is 25, so h is set to 25.

Next, the code checks if the value of h is greater than or equal to 30. Since 25 is not greater than or equal to 30, the condition is false.

As a result, the code executes the else block and prints "No" to the console.

<<<Output>>>
No
