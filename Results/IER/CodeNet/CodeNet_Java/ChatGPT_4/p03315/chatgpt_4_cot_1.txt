<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `+-++` is converted to a character array `ary` with the characters `['+', '-', '+', '+']`.
The variable `num` is initialized to 0.
The program enters a for-each loop to iterate over each character in the array.
For each character, it checks if the character is a '+' or a '-':
- The first character is '+', so `num` is incremented by 1 (num = 1).
- The second character is '-', so `num` is decremented by 1 (num = 0).
- The third character is '+', so `num` is incremented by 1 (num = 1).
- The fourth character is '+', so `num` is incremented by 1 (num = 2).
After the loop, the final value of `num` is 2, which is printed as the output.
