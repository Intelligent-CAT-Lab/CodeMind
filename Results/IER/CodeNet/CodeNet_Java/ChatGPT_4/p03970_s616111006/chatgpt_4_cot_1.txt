<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `main` method that creates an instance of `Main` and calls its `run` method. The `run` method sets up an input stream and a print writer, then calls the `solver` method, and finally flushes the output.

The `solver` method initializes a string `a` with the value "CODEFESTIVAL2016". It then reads a string `s` from the input, which in this case is "C0DEFESTIVAL2O16". The method initializes an integer `ans` to 0, which will hold the count of characters that differ between `a` and `s`.

The method then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the string `s`. For each character in `s`, it compares it with the corresponding character in `a`. If the characters are different, it increments `ans` by 1.

The differences between `a` ("CODEFESTIVAL2016") and `s` ("C0DEFESTIVAL2O16") are as follows:
- The second character is different: 'O' in `a` and '0' (zero) in `s`.
- The fifteenth character is different: '0' in `a` and 'O' (letter O) in `s`.

There are 2 differences in total, so `ans` will be 2.

After the loop, the method prints the value of `ans` using `out.println(ans)`.
