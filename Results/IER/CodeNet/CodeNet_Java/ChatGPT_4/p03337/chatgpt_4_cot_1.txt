<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main class with a main method that creates an instance of `InputReader` to read from `System.in` and an instance of `OutputWriter` to write to `System.out`. It then creates an instance of `TaskA` and calls its `solve` method.

The `solve` method of `TaskA` reads two integers `a` and `b` using the `InputReader` instance. It then calculates the maximum value of three expressions: `a + b`, `a - b`, and `a * b`. The `OutputWriter` instance is used to print the result to the output.

Given the input `3 1`, the `solve` method will calculate:
- `a + b` = `3 + 1` = `4`
- `a - b` = `3 - 1` = `2`
- `a * b` = `3 * 1` = `3`

The maximum of these three values is `4`, so the `OutputWriter` will print `4` to the output.
