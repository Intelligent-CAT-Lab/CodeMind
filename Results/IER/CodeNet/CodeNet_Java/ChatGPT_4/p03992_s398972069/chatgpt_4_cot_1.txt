<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is `CODEFESTIVAL`. The `solveA()` method is called within the `solve()` method, which is the only method executed in the `main` method. The `solveA()` method takes the input string and prints it after splitting it into two parts: the first four characters and the rest of the string. It uses the `substring` method of the `String` class to achieve this.

The `substring` method is called twice: `s.substring(0, 4)` will extract the characters from index 0 to index 3 (inclusive), which is `CODE`. The second call `s.substring(4)` will extract the characters from index 4 to the end of the string, which is `FESTIVAL`.

The output will be these two parts concatenated with a space in between, as per the `println` statement in `solveA()`.
