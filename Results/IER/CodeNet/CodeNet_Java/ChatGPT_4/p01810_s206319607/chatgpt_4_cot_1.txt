<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and iterates from 0 to N - 2 (since N is 4, it iterates from 0 to 2).

In the first iteration (i = 0), the value of ans is 0. The expression ans / (K - 1) + 1 evaluates to 0 / (2 - 1) + 1, which is 1. So, ans becomes 1.

In the second iteration (i = 1), the value of ans is 1. The expression ans / (K - 1) + 1 evaluates to 1 / (2 - 1) + 1, which is 2. So, ans becomes 3 (1 from the previous value plus 2 from this iteration).

In the third iteration (i = 2), the value of ans is 3. The expression ans / (K - 1) + 1 evaluates to 3 / (2 - 1) + 1, which is 4. So, ans becomes 7 (3 from the previous value plus 4 from this iteration).

The loop ends after the third iteration because i < N - 1 is no longer true for i = 3.

Finally, the program prints the value of ans, which is 7.
