<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a method `isNumber` that checks if a given string can be parsed into a long number without causing a `NumberFormatException`. In the `main` method, it creates a `Scanner` to read input and an `ArrayList` to store long numbers.

The program reads input tokens one by one in a loop. For each token:
- If the token is a number (checked by `isNumber` method), it is parsed to a long and added to the list.
- If the token is a "+", it calculates the sum of the last two numbers in the list, removes the last number, and replaces the second last number with the sum.
- If the token is a "-", it calculates the difference of the second last number minus the last number in the list, removes the last number, and replaces the second last number with the difference.
- If the token is anything else (implicitly assuming it's "*"), it calculates the product of the last two numbers in the list, removes the last number, and replaces the second last number with the product.

Given the input `1 2 +`, the following steps occur:
1. "1" is read, determined to be a number, and added to the list.
2. "2" is read, determined to be a number, and added to the list.
3. "+" is read, the sum of the last two numbers (1 and 2) is calculated to be 3, the last number (2) is removed from the list, and the second last number (1) is replaced with the sum (3).

After processing the input, the list contains a single element, which is the number 3. The program then prints the first element of the list and closes the scanner.
