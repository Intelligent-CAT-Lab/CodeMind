<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single string input using a Scanner object. The input string is "CODEFESTIVAL".
The length of the input string is calculated using the length() method, which in this case is 12.
The code then prints a substring of the input string starting from index 0 up to the length of the string minus 8 characters. 
The substring method is called with parameters 0 and 4 (12 - 8 = 4), which means it will return the first 4 characters of the input string.
Therefore, the output will be the first 4 characters of "CODEFESTIVAL", which are "CODE".
