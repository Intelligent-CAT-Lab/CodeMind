<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a method `solve` that takes an `InputStream` and a `PrintStream` as arguments. The `main` method calls `solve` with `System.in` and `System.out`, which are the standard input and output streams, respectively.

The `solve` method creates a `Scanner` object to read from the input stream. It reads a single string `s` using `sc.next()`.

The code then checks the value of `s` using a series of `if` statements. If `s` is "A", it prints "T". If `s` is "T", it prints "A". If `s` is "G", it prints "C". If `s` is "C", it prints "G".

Given the input `A`, the first `if` condition `s.equals("A")` evaluates to true, so it prints "T" to the output stream.

No `else` statements are used, so the code does not prevent multiple conditions from being true. However, since the input is a single character, only one condition will be true.
