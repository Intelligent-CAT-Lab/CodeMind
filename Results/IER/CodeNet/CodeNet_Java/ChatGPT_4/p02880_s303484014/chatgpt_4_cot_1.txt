<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main class with a main method and a Scanner class that extends Closeable and is used to read input from System.in.

The main method creates an instance of the Scanner class to read an integer N, which is set to 10 based on the input provided.

The code then enters a nested loop structure with two loops, each ranging from 1 to 9. The outer loop iterates with variable i and the inner loop iterates with variable j.

For each combination of i and j, the code checks if the product of i and j equals N (which is 10). If a combination is found where i * j equals N, the code prints "Yes" and returns, which exits the main method.

If no such combination is found after all iterations, the code prints "No".

In this case, since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and both 2 and 5 are within the range of 1 to 9, the condition i * j == N will be true when i is 2 and j is 5.

Therefore, the code will print "Yes" and return immediately without checking further combinations.
