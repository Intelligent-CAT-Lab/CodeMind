<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads a line of input and assigns it to the variable 'pre'.
The next line is a ternary operator that checks if the value of 'pre' is equal to the string "ABC". If it is, it prints "ARC"; otherwise, it prints "ABC".
Given the input 'ABC', the condition pre.equals("ABC") evaluates to true, so the ternary operator will result in "ARC" being printed.
<<<Output>>>
ARC
