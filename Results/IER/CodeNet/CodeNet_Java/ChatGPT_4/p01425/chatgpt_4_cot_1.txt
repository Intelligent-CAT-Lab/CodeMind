<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to simulate the trajectory of a projectile (like a bird in the game Angry Birds) and determine if it can reach a certain point (X, Y) without hitting any obstacles. The obstacles are defined by their left (L), bottom (B), right (R), and top (T) coordinates.

The input `0 7 3 1` initializes the variables as follows:
- N (number of obstacles) = 0
- V (initial velocity) = 7
- X (target x-coordinate) = 3
- Y (target y-coordinate) = 1

Since N is 0, there are no obstacles to input or consider.

The `check` method is called with the target coordinates (X, Y). Inside this method, it calculates the discriminant D of a quadratic equation to find the time t at which the projectile could reach the target. If D is negative, it means there is no real solution for t, and the method would return false. However, since there are no obstacles, the loop that checks for collisions with obstacles is never entered.

The discriminant D is calculated as follows:
- a = g*g/4 = 9.8*9.8/4
- b = g*qy - V*V = 9.8*1 - 7*7
- c = qx*qx + qy*qy = 3*3 + 1*1
- D = b*b - 4*a*c

Substituting the values:
- a = 24.01
- b = 9.8 - 49 = -39.2
- c = 9 + 1 = 10
- D = (-39.2)*(-39.2) - 4*24.01*10

Calculating D:
- D = 1536.64 - 960.8 = 575.84

Since D is positive, there are real solutions for t. The code then checks for two possible times (t2) by adding and subtracting the square root of D from -b and dividing by 2*a. It only considers positive times.

For each valid t2, it calculates the corresponding t, vx, and vy. It then calculates the y-coordinate of the projectile at the x-coordinate of the target (X) using the `calc` method. If this y-coordinate is not less than Y (the target y-coordinate), the projectile can potentially reach the target.

Since there are no obstacles, the method will return true, and the main method will print "Yes".
