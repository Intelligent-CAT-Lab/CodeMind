<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 725 according to the input.
The code then checks the value of x against a series of if-else conditions to determine the value of variable k.
Since 725 is greater than or equal to 600 and less than 800, the condition for the second if statement is met, and k is set to 7.
No other conditions are checked after this because the else-if structure ensures only one block of code is executed.
Finally, the value of k, which is 7, is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
7
