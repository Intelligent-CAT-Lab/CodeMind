<<<Analysis>>>
The variable w is initialized with 25 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with an empty string.
It enters a while loop and continues until w is not equal to 0.

1. In the first iteration, w is 25. The remainder of 25 % 3 is 2. Therefore, ans becomes "-" + "" which is "-". Then w is divided by 3 and incremented by 1, resulting in w becoming 9.
2. In the second iteration, w is 9. The remainder of 9 % 3 is 0. Therefore, ans becomes "0" + "-" which is "0-". Then w is divided by 3, resulting in w becoming 3.
3. In the third iteration, w is 3. The remainder of 3 % 3 is 0. Therefore, ans becomes "0" + "0-" which is "00-". Then w is divided by 3, resulting in w becoming 1.
4. In the fourth iteration, w is 1. The remainder of 1 % 3 is 1. Therefore, ans becomes "+" + "00-" which is "+00-". Then w is divided by 3, resulting in w becoming 0.

The while loop ends because w is now 0. The final value of ans is "+00-".

<<<Output>>>
+00-
