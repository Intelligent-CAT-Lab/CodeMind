<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main class with a main method and a nested FastScanner class. The FastScanner class is used to read input from the standard input stream.

The main method creates an instance of FastScanner and reads an integer value into the variable x using the nextInt() method of FastScanner.

The value of x is then compared to 30. If x is greater than or equal to 30, the program prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

Given the input `25`, the value of x is set to 25. Since 25 is not greater than or equal to 30, the condition in the if statement evaluates to false, and the program will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
