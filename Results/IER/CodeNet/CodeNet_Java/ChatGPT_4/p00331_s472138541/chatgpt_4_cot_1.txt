<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input.

The input provided is `-3 3`. Therefore, a is assigned the value -3 and b is assigned the value 3.

The code then checks the sum of a and b:
- If the sum is greater than 0, it prints "1".
- If the sum is less than 0, it prints "-1".
- If the sum is equal to 0, it prints "0".

In this case, the sum of a and b is `-3 + 3`, which equals 0. Therefore, the condition for the sum being greater than 0 or less than 0 is not met, and the else block is executed, printing "0".

<<<Output>>>
0
