<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "11121314" is passed to the `solve` method. The `solve` method calls two other methods: `checkEqual` and `check12`, and prints the minimum of the results from these two methods.

In the `checkEqual` method, the program checks for all possible substrings of equal length that can divide the string S completely without leaving any characters. For each valid substring length k, it finds the minimum and maximum substrings (mins and maxs) and calculates the difference between them using the `sub` method. The minimum difference found for all k is stored in the variable `ans`.

For the input "11121314", the possible values of k are 1, 2, 4, and 7 (since the length of S is 8). The method will skip k = 7 because 8 % 7 is not 0. For k = 1, 2, and 4, the method will find the minimum and maximum substrings and calculate the differences. The minimum difference found will be stored in `ans`.

In the `check12` method, the program checks each character of the string S. If the character is '1' and it is not the last character, it considers the two-character number formed by '1' and the next character. It calculates the maximum and minimum values found and returns the difference between them.

For the input "11121314", the `check12` method will consider the numbers 11, 12, 13, and 14, and find the maximum and minimum values among them, which are 14 and 11, respectively. The difference is 3.

Finally, the `solve` method will print the minimum of the results from `checkEqual` and `check12`. Since `check12` returns 3, and `checkEqual` will not return a value less than 3 (as the minimum possible difference is 0 and the initial value of `ans` is 8), the output will be 3.
