<<<Analysis>>>
The input "10 5" is read and split into two strings "10" and "5", which are then parsed into integers i1 and i2 with values 10 and 5, respectively.
The variable count is initialized with the result of the integer division of i1 by i2, which is 10 / 5 = 2.
Then, the remainder of the division of i1 by i2 is calculated using the modulus operator, which is 10 % 5 = 0.
The value of the remainder (0) is added to count, so count remains 2.
Finally, the value of count is printed to the console, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
