<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input. Let's denote them as x, y, and z respectively. According to the input, x=5, y=2, and z=4.

The expression inside the System.out.println() is evaluated as follows:
- (x * 0 + y + z) % 2
- Since x is multiplied by 0, it becomes 0 and does not affect the sum.
- The sum is then y + z, which is 2 + 4 = 6.
- The result of the sum is then taken modulo 2, which is 6 % 2 = 0.

Since the result of the modulo operation is 0, which is even, the ternary operator (?) evaluates to "Alice".

Therefore, the output of the code will be "Alice".
