<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable 'a' using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object. The input provided is 21, so 'a' is set to 21.

The code then calculates the expression (48 - a) and prints the result. Since 'a' is 21, the expression evaluates to (48 - 21), which equals 27.

Finally, the output of the code is the result of the expression, which is 27.
<<<Output>>>
27
