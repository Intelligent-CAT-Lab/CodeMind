<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads an integer N from the input, which is 5 in this case.

The code checks if N is even by using the modulus operator (N%2). If N is even, it prints N/2. If N is odd, it prints N/2 + 1.

Since 5 is odd (5%2 equals 1), the code will execute the else block. It calculates 5/2 which is 2 (since it's integer division), and then adds 1 to it, resulting in 3.

Therefore, the output will be 3.
