<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `4000 2000 500`. The variables k, a, and b are initialized with 4000, 2000, and 500 respectively according to the input.

The `solve` method of the `AKaiden` class is called with these values. Inside the `solve` method, the following conditions are checked:

1. If k is less than or equal to a, then it prints 1 and a newline. This condition is not met because k (4000) is greater than a (2000).

2. If a minus b is less than or equal to 0, then it prints -1 and a newline. This condition is not met because a (2000) minus b (500) is 1500, which is greater than 0.

3. Otherwise, it calculates the number of steps required to reach or exceed k starting from a, with each step being a forward move by a and a backward move by b. The formula used is `(k - b - 1) / (a - b) * 2 + 1`. This is because the first move is always forward (hence the +1 at the end), and after that, each cycle consists of a forward and a backward move, which effectively moves the position forward by `a - b` units.

Plugging in the values, we get:
`(4000 - 500 - 1) / (2000 - 500) * 2 + 1`
`= (3499) / (1500) * 2 + 1`
`= 2 * 2 + 1`
`= 4 + 1`
`= 5`

So the output will be 5 followed by a newline.

5
