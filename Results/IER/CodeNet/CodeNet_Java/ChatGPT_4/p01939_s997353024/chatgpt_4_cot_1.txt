<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3 9`, which means `first_N` is assigned the value 3 and `first_M` is assigned the value 9. The variable `MOD` is a constant with the value 1000000007.

The code first checks if `first_N` is equal to 1, which it is not, so it skips the first `if` block.

Next, it calculates `first_limit` based on the values of `first_N` and `first_M`. Since `(first_M+1) % (first_N-1)` is equal to `(9+1) % (3-1)`, which is `10 % 2`, the result is 0. Therefore, `first_limit` is calculated as `(first_M+1) / (first_N-1) - 1`, which is `(9+1) / (3-1) - 1`, resulting in `5 - 1`, which is 4.

Since `first_limit` is greater than 0, the code proceeds to the else block.

Inside the else block, it uses `BigInteger` to handle large integer calculations. It calculates the following:
- `A` as `BigInteger.valueOf(first_M+1)`, which is `BigInteger.valueOf(9+1)`, resulting in `BigInteger.valueOf(10)`.
- `B` as `BigInteger.valueOf(2*(first_M+1)).multiply(limit)`, which is `BigInteger.valueOf(2*10).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(4))`, resulting in `BigInteger.valueOf(20).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(4))`, which is `BigInteger.valueOf(80)`.
- `C` as `BigInteger.valueOf(first_N-1).multiply(limit).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(first_limit+1))`, which is `BigInteger.valueOf(3-1).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(4)).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(4+1))`, resulting in `BigInteger.valueOf(2).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(4)).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(5))`, which is `BigInteger.valueOf(40)`.

The final result is calculated as `(A.add(B).subtract(C)).remainder(bigMOD)`, which is `(BigInteger.valueOf(10).add(BigInteger.valueOf(80)).subtract(BigInteger.valueOf(40))).remainder(BigInteger.valueOf(MOD))`, resulting in `BigInteger.valueOf(50).remainder(BigInteger.valueOf(1000000007))`, which is `BigInteger.valueOf(50)`.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of `BigInteger.valueOf(50)`, which is `50`.
