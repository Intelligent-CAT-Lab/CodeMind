<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to check if a string of characters is a "mirror" string, where certain characters must have their corresponding mirror characters at the symmetric position in the string. The characters 'p' and 'q' are mirrors of each other, as are 'b' and 'd'.

The input string is "pdbq". The length of the string (n) is 4.

The code iterates over each character in the string and checks if it has the correct corresponding mirror character at the symmetric position. The checks are as follows:

- For index i = 0, c[i] is 'p', and c[n-1-i] is 'q'. This is a correct mirror pair, so the loop continues.
- For index i = 1, c[i] is 'd', and c[n-1-i] is 'b'. This is also a correct mirror pair, so the loop continues.
- The loop will continue to check the remaining characters, but since the string is symmetric and the previous checks were correct, no further checks are needed.

Since all characters have their correct mirror counterparts, the code will output "Yes" after the loop finishes.

Yes
