<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with several methods and a `main` method that executes the `solve` method. The `solve` method is designed to find the minimum number of "good numbers" that multiply together to form a given number `N`. A "good number" is defined as a number that consists of only the digits 2 and 8.

The `createGoodNumber` method generates all "good numbers" less than 1e17 and stores them in an `ArrayList` called `all`. It uses a queue to generate these numbers by starting with 2 and 8 and then appending 2 or 8 to the end of each number in the queue, multiplying by 10 each time to shift the digits left.

The `dfs` method is a recursive depth-first search that tries to divide `N` by each "good number" in `sub` (a subset of `all` that are divisors of `N`) and recursively calls itself with the quotient until it reaches 1, counting the number of divisions. It uses a memoization technique with a `HashMap` array `map` to store previously computed results for specific `n` values to avoid redundant calculations.

The `solve` method reads the input `N`, generates the "good numbers", and then filters them to find those that are divisors of `N`, storing them in `sub`. If `N` is 1, it prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, it initializes the `map` array and then calls `dfs` starting with the first "good number" and `N`. The result of `dfs` is printed.

Given the input `1`, the following steps occur:
1. `N` is set to 1.
2. `createGoodNumber` is called, but the generated "good numbers" are irrelevant because `N` is 1.
3. The `solve` method checks if `N` is 1, which it is, so it prints -1 and returns.

Therefore, the output will be -1.
