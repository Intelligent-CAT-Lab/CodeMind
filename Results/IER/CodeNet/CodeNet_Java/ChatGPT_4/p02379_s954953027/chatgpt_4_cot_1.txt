<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes four static variables x1, y1, x2, y2 by reading from the standard input using a Scanner object. The input provided is `0 0 1 1`, so x1 and y1 are set to 0.0, and x2 and y2 are set to 1.0.

The main method calculates the distance between the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the distance formula: sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2). The calculation is as follows:

ans = Math.sqrt((0 - 1)*(0 - 1) + (0 - 1)*(0 - 1))
    = Math.sqrt((1)*(1) + (1)*(1))
    = Math.sqrt(1 + 1)
    = Math.sqrt(2)
    = 1.4142135623730951 (approximately)

The result is then printed to the standard output. The output will be the calculated distance with a precision depending on the default formatting of the double data type in Java when printed using System.out.println.
