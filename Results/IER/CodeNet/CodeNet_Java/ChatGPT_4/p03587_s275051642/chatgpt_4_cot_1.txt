<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "111100" is read and converted to a character array s with the elements {'1', '1', '1', '1', '0', '0'}.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
A for loop iterates over each character in the array s.
For each iteration, it checks if the current character is '1'.
If the character is '1', it increments the ans variable by 1.
The loop encounters '1' four times, so ans is incremented four times.
After the loop finishes, the final value of ans, which is 4, is printed as the output.
<<<Output>>>
4
