<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "QWERTYASDFZXCV" is stored in the variable `s`. The `toCharArray` method is used to convert the string into a character array `words`.

The program then initializes two integer variables `min` and `max` to 0.

The first for loop iterates over the character array from the end to the beginning (in reverse order). It looks for the character 'A'. The variable `min` is updated with the index of the last 'A' found in the string. In the given string, the last 'A' is at index 6 (0-based index).

The second for loop iterates over the character array from the beginning to the end. It looks for the character 'Z'. The variable `max` is updated with the index of the last 'Z' found in the string. In the given string, the last 'Z' is at index 11 (0-based index).

Finally, the program calculates the difference between `max` and `min` and adds 1 to get the length of the substring from the first 'A' to the last 'Z'. The calculation is `max - min + 1`, which is `11 - 6 + 1 = 6`.

The output is the length of the substring, which is 6 in this case.
