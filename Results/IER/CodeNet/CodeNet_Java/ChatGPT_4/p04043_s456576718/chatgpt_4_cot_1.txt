<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input and stores them in an array named 'in'. The input provided is `5 5 7`.
The array 'in' initially contains the elements [5, 5, 7].
The code then sorts the array 'in' using Arrays.sort(in). However, since the input numbers are already in ascending order, the sorted array remains [5, 5, 7].
After sorting, the code checks if the first element is 5, the second element is 5, and the third element is 7 using the condition in[0]==5 && in[1]==5 && in[2]==7.
Since the sorted array meets this condition, the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
