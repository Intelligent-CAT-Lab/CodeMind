<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `1101` is read into the array `s` as integer values by subtracting the ASCII value of '0' from each character. The array `s` will contain the values [1, 1, 0, 1].

Two `IntegerPreSum` objects `ips[0]` and `ips[1]` are created. `ips[0]` is for even indices where `s[i]` is 1, and `ips[1]` is for odd indices where `s[i]` is 1. The prefix sums for these conditions are calculated.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, and two boolean arrays `used` and `star` are created to keep track of used indices and starred indices, respectively. The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0.

The code then iterates over the array `s` from index 0 to 3. When it encounters a 1 in `s`, it marks the current index as used and starred, increments `cnt`, and adds `cnt` to `ans`. If the next index is within bounds, it also marks it as used, increments `cnt`, and adds `cnt` to `ans` again, then skips the next index by incrementing `i`.

After the first loop, `ans` is 6, `cnt` is 2, `used` is [true, true, false, true], and `star` is [true, false, false, true].

An `IntegerPreSum` object `occur` is created to keep track of the number of used indices up to a certain point.

The code then iterates over the array `s` in reverse. If an index is used and starred, `cnt` is decremented. If an index is not used, `ans` is incremented by `cnt`. Additionally, if the number of used indices up to the previous index is even, `ans` is incremented by the number of 1s in `s` at even or odd indices (depending on the current index) after the current index. This is determined by the `ips` prefix sums.

After the second loop, `ans` is 10.

Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`.
