<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value n from the input, which is 3 in this case.

The variable sum is initialized to 0. A for loop is set up to run from i = 1 to i = n (inclusive). In each iteration, the current value of i is added to sum.

The iterations of the loop will be as follows:
- In the first iteration, i = 1, so sum = 0 + 1 = 1.
- In the second iteration, i = 2, so sum = 1 + 2 = 3.
- In the third iteration, i = 3, so sum = 3 + 3 = 6.

After the loop finishes, the final value of sum, which is 6, is printed to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
6
