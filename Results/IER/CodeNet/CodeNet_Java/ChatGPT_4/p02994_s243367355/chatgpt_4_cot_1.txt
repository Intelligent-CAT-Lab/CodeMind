<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `5 2`, which means `N = 5` and `L = 2`. The code is designed to calculate the taste level of a pie, which is determined by the sum of the taste levels of individual pieces. The taste level of each piece is given by `L + i - 1`, where `i` is the index of the piece starting from 1.

The code checks three conditions based on the value of `L`:
1. If `L` is less than or equal to `-N`, it calculates the sum of taste levels excluding the last piece.
2. If `L` is less than 0 but greater than `-N`, it calculates the sum of taste levels including all pieces.
3. If `L` is greater than or equal to 0, it calculates the sum of taste levels excluding the first piece.

For the given input `5 2`, the third condition applies because `L` is greater than 0. Therefore, the code will calculate the sum of taste levels excluding the first piece.

The taste levels of the pieces are as follows:
Piece 1: 2 + 1 - 1 = 2
Piece 2: 2 + 2 - 1 = 3
Piece 3: 2 + 3 - 1 = 4
Piece 4: 2 + 4 - 1 = 5
Piece 5: 2 + 5 - 1 = 6

The sum excluding the first piece is 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18.

The code uses the formula `(N - 1) * (2 * L + N) / 2` to calculate the sum, which simplifies to `(5 - 1) * (2 * 2 + 5) / 2` = `4 * 9 / 2` = `36 / 2` = `18`.

Therefore, the output will be `18`.
