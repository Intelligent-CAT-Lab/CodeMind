<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three integer variables W, a, and b with the values 3, 2, and 6 respectively according to the input. It then checks the following conditions:
1. If a + W is less than b, it prints the result of b - a - W.
2. Else if b + W is less than a, it prints the result of a - b - W.
3. Otherwise, it prints "0".

In this case, the first condition is true because a + W (2 + 3) equals 5, which is less than b (6). Therefore, the code will execute the first condition and print the result of b - a - W, which is 6 - 2 - 3, equal to 1.
