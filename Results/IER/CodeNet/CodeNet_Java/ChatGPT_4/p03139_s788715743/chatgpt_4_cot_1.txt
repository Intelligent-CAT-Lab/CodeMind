<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read from the standard input. It then reads three integers n, a, and b with the values 10, 3, and 5 respectively according to the input.

The variables max and min are initialized to 0. The code then assigns the minimum of a and b to max using the min function from the java.lang.Math package. Since a is 3 and b is 5, max will be assigned the value 3.

Next, the code checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to n. In this case, 3 + 5 is 8, which is not greater than or equal to 10. Therefore, the if condition is not satisfied, and min remains 0.

Finally, the code prints the values of max and min separated by a space. Since max is 3 and min is 0, the output will be "3 0".

<<<Output>>>
3 0
