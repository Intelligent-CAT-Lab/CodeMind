<<<Analysis>>>
The input `1905` is read and stored in the variable S. The variable yy is calculated as S / 100, which is 1905 / 100 = 19. The variable mm is calculated as S % 100, which is 1905 % 100 = 5.

The first if condition checks if yy is between 1 and 12. Since yy is 19, this condition is false. Therefore, the code moves to the else block.

The nested if condition inside the else block checks if mm is between 1 and 12. Since mm is 5, this condition is true.

Because the yy is not between 1 and 12, but mm is between 1 and 12, the output will be "YYMM".

<<<Output>>>
YYMM
