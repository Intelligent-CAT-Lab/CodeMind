<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input. The input provided is `5 4`, so a is set to 5 and b is set to 4.

The code then checks if both a and b are less than or equal to 8. Since both 5 and 4 satisfy this condition, the code enters the if block and prints "Yay!" to the standard output.

If either a or b were greater than 8, the else block would be executed, and ":(" would be printed instead. However, in this case, since both a and b are less than or equal to 8, "Yay!" is the expected output.

<<<Output>>>
Yay!
