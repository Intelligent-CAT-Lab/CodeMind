The variables A, B, C, and D are initialized with 1, 1, 2, and 2 respectively according to the input. The MOD constant is set to 998244353.

A 2D array `dp` of size 2x2 and a 2D array `sum` of size 2x2 are created. The element at `sum[0][0]` is set to 1, as B-1 and A-1 are both 0.

The first for loop initializes the first row of `sum` (i.e., `sum[0][1]`) with the value `(sum[0][0]*1)%MOD`, which is 1.

The second nested for loop calculates the values for `dp` and `sum` for the rest of the elements. Since B is 1 and D is 2, the outer loop runs once, and since A is 1 and C is 2, the inner loop also runs once. The calculations are as follows:

- `dp[1][1] = dp[0][1]*1 + sum[0][0]*1` which simplifies to `dp[1][1] = 0*1 + 1*1` (since `dp[0][1]` is not initialized and defaults to 0). So `dp[1][1]` is 1.
- `sum[1][1] = (sum[1][0]*(2) + dp[1][1])%MOD` which simplifies to `sum[1][1] = (0*2 + 1)%MOD`. So `sum[1][1]` is 1.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. Two more nested loops calculate the final answer. The outer loop runs once (i = 1), and the inner loop runs once (j = 1). The calculations are as follows:

- `powC` is initialized to 1 and remains 1 throughout the loop since C is 2 and D is 2.
- `powI` is initialized to 1 and remains 1 throughout the loop since i is 1 and j is 1.
- `ans = (ans + dp[1][1]*((powC*powI)%MOD))%MOD` which simplifies to `ans = (0 + 1*((1*1)%MOD))%MOD`. So `ans` is 1.
- `ans = (ans + (powC*sum[0][1])%MOD)%MOD` which simplifies to `ans = (1 + (1*1)%MOD)%MOD`. So `ans` is 2.

The final value of `ans` is 2, which is printed as the output.
