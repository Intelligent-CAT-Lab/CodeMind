The input string `s` is "ABC". The `solve` method is called with this string.

Inside the `solve` method, the first condition checks if `s` is equal to "ABC". Since this is true, the method returns `true`.

Back in the `main` method, the `solve` method's return value (`true`) is used to print "Yes" to the output.

The `out.flush()` call ensures that "Yes" is actually written out to the system output before the program terminates.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
