<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `10 10 5`, which means `a = 10`, `b = 10`, and `c = 5`. The sum of `a` and `b` is stored in `d`, which is `20`. The variable `e` is initialized to `-1`.

The program enters a loop that will iterate up to 1000 times. Inside the loop, the program calculates `(60*i+c)%d` for each `i` starting from `0`. It checks if the result of this calculation is greater than or equal to `0` and less than or equal to `a`. If this condition is true, it means that the time `60*i+c` falls within the first `a` minutes of an hour, considering a cycle of `d` minutes.

For the given input, the loop will check the condition for each `i` starting from `0`. The condition will be true for the first time when `i` is `0` because `(60*0+5)%20` is `5`, which is within the range `[0, 10]`. Therefore, `e` is set to `0` and the loop breaks.

Since `e` is not `-1`, the program will print `60*e+c`, which is `60*0+5`, resulting in `5`.

The output is then flushed to the console, and the `Reader` and `PrintWriter` are closed.
