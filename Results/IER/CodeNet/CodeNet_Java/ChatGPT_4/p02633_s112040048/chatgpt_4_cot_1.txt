<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 90 according to the input.
The main method calls the lcm method with arguments 360 and x (which is 90).
Inside the lcm method, it first calls the gcd method to find the greatest common divisor of 360 and 90.
The gcd method works as follows:
- gcd(360, 90)
- Since 360 is not 0, it calls gcd(90 % 360, 360), which is gcd(90, 360).
- Since 90 is not 0, it calls gcd(360 % 90, 90), which is gcd(0, 90).
- Since the first argument is now 0, it returns the second argument, which is 90.

Now that we have the gcd as 90, we return to the lcm method and calculate the lcm as (360 * 90) / 90, which simplifies to 360.
Finally, the main method prints the result of lcm(360, x) / x, which is 360 / 90, resulting in 4.
