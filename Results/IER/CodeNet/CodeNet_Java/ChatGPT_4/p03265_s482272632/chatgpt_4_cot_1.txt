<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided initializes the variables x1, y1, x2, and y2 with 0, 0, 0, and 1 respectively. The variables x3, y3, x4, and y4 are declared but not initialized.

The difference between x2 and x1 is calculated and stored in diffX, which is 0 - 0 = 0.
The difference between y2 and y1 is calculated and stored in diffY, which is 1 - 0 = 1.

The value of x3 is calculated as x2 - diffY, which is 0 - 1 = -1.
The value of y3 is calculated as y2 + diffX, which is 1 + 0 = 1.

The value of x4 is calculated as x3 - diffX, which is -1 - 0 = -1.
The value of y4 is calculated as y3 - diffY, which is 1 - 1 = 0.

Finally, the program prints the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4 in the specified format, which are -1, 1, -1, and 0 respectively.

<<<Output>>>
-1 1 -1 0
