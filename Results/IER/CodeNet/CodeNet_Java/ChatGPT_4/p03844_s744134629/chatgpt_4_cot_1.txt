<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and tokenizes it using StringTokenizer. The input `1 + 2` is split into three tokens: "1", "+", and "2". These tokens are then parsed into their respective types: the first and third tokens are parsed as long integers (i and j), and the second token is parsed as a character (ch).

The variable i is initialized with the value 1, the variable ch is initialized with the character '+', and the variable j is initialized with the value 2.

The code then checks if the character ch is a '+' or not. Since ch is '+', the condition is true, and the code executes the addition operation (i + j), which is 1 + 2.

The result of the addition, which is 3, is then printed to the standard output.
