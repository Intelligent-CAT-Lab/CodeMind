<<<Analysis>>>
The main method initializes an InputStream and OutputStream for System.in and System.out, respectively. It then creates an instance of InputReader and PrintWriter to handle input and output operations. A Task object is created, and its solve method is called with the testNumber 1, the InputReader in, and the PrintWriter out.

Inside the Task class's solve method, it calls in.nextInt() to read an integer from the input, which is the value 4 according to the given input. This integer is stored in the variable r.

The solve method then calculates the result of the expression 3 * r * r, which is 3 times the square of r. Since r is 4, the square of r is 16, and 3 times 16 is 48.

Finally, the result 48 is printed to the output using out.println().

The PrintWriter is then closed using out.close(), which ensures that the output is flushed and no further output can be written.
