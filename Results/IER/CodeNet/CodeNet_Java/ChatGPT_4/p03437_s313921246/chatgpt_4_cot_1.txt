<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, x and y, from the input.

The input provided is `8 6`, so x is assigned the value 8 and y is assigned the value 6.

The code then evaluates the expression `x % y == 0 ? -1 : x`. This is a ternary operator that checks if x is divisible by y (i.e., if the remainder of x divided by y is 0). If it is, the expression evaluates to -1; otherwise, it evaluates to the value of x.

For the given input, 8 % 6 is 2, which is not equal to 0. Therefore, the condition `x % y == 0` is false, and the ternary operator will evaluate to the value of x, which is 8.

Finally, the code prints the result of the ternary operation, which in this case is 8, and then closes the Scanner object.

<<<Output>>>
8
