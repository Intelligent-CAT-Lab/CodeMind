<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables x, a, and b with the values 5, 2, and 7 respectively. It then calculates the absolute difference between x and a, which is |5 - 2| = 3, and the absolute difference between x and b, which is |5 - 7| = 2. The code compares these two absolute differences using a ternary operator. Since Math.abs(x-a) is greater than Math.abs(x-b), the condition evaluates to true, and the ternary operator returns 'B'. The result 'B' is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
B
