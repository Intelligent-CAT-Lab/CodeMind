<<<Analysis>>>
The input N is initialized with the value 3. An array `cnt` of size N+1 (which is 4 in this case) is created to count the occurrences of each prime factor for numbers from 2 to N.

The outer for loop starts with i=2 and goes up to N (3 in this case). For each value of i, it initializes a temporary variable `temp` with the value of i.

The inner for loop starts with j=2 and continues as long as j*j is less than or equal to `temp`. This loop is used to find prime factors of `temp`. If `temp` is divisible by j, it increments the count for j in the `cnt` array and divides `temp` by j. This process continues until `temp` is no longer divisible by j.

After the inner loop, if `temp` is greater than 1, it means `temp` itself is a prime number and should be counted, so it increments the count for `temp` in the `cnt` array.

After the prime factorization is done for all numbers from 2 to N, the code calculates the answer. It initializes a variable `ans` with 1 and iterates through the `cnt` array starting from index 2 up to N. For each index i, it multiplies `ans` by (cnt[i]+1) and takes the modulus with MOD (1000000007) to keep the result within the bounds of a 32-bit integer.

Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

Let's go through the steps with N=3:
- For i=2: `temp` is 2, which is a prime number, so cnt[2] is incremented by 1.
- For i=3: `temp` is 3, which is a prime number, so cnt[3] is incremented by 1.

Now, the `cnt` array has the following counts: [0, 0, 1, 1], which means there is one occurrence of the prime number 2 and one occurrence of the prime number 3.

The answer is calculated as follows:
- ans = (1 * (cnt[2]+1)) % MOD = (1 * (1+1)) % MOD = 2 % MOD = 2
- ans = (ans * (cnt[3]+1)) % MOD = (2 * (1+1)) % MOD = 4 % MOD = 4

The final answer is 4.
