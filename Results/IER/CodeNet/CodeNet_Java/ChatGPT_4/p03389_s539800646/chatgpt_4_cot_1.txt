<<<Analysis>>>
The input values are 2, 5, and 4. These values are stored in the array `list` and then sorted, resulting in the array becoming {2, 4, 5}.
The variable `times` is initialized to 0.

The while loop will continue to execute as long as the third element of the list (the largest number) is less than or equal to 52.

The loop checks if all three numbers are equal (which would mean the loop should break), but initially, they are not.

Since the second and third elements are not equal (4 != 5), the first and second elements are incremented by 1, resulting in the list becoming {3, 5, 5} and `times` is incremented to 1.

The list is sorted again, but it remains {3, 5, 5}.

The loop continues, and now the second and third elements are equal, so the first element is incremented by 2, resulting in the list becoming {5, 5, 5} and `times` is incremented to 2.

The list is sorted again, but it remains {5, 5, 5}.

Now, since all three numbers are equal, the loop breaks.

The value of `times` is 2, which is the final output of the program.
