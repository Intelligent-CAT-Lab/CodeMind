The variables N, A, and B are initialized with 20, 2, and 5 respectively according to the input. The variable answer is initialized with 0.
The code enters a for loop and iterates from A (2) to N (20) to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, the current integer i is converted to a character array char_ary.
The variable sum is reset to 0, and the flag add_flg is set to true for each iteration.
The inner for-each loop iterates over each character in char_ary, converting each character to its numeric value and adding it to sum.
If at any point the sum exceeds B (5), the add_flg is set to false and the loop breaks, skipping to the next iteration of the outer loop.
If the sum is within the range [A, B] after the inner loop completes, the current integer i is added to the answer.
The condition is met when i is 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 20.
After the loop finishes, the final value of the answer is printed as output, which is 84.
