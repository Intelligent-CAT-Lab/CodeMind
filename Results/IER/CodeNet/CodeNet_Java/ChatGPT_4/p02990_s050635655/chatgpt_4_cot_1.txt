<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to solve a combinatorial problem using modular arithmetic with a modulus of MOD = 1000000007L. The input `5 3` initializes N with 5 and K with 3.

The `CombCalculator` interface is implemented by the `FactorialTableCombCalculator` class, which precomputes factorials and their modular inverses to quickly calculate combinations modulo MOD.

The `solve` method reads the input N and K, then creates an instance of `FactorialTableCombCalculator` with size N and modulus MOD. It then enters a loop from i = 1 to K (inclusive), calculating two combinations for each iteration and printing their product modulo MOD.

The two combinations calculated in each iteration are:
1. cc.comb(N - K + 1, i) - This calculates the combination of choosing i elements from a set of (N - K + 1) elements.
2. cc.comb(K - 1, i - 1) - This calculates the combination of choosing (i - 1) elements from a set of (K - 1) elements.

The product of these two combinations is then taken modulo MOD and printed.

For the input `5 3`, the loop will run three times with i taking values 1, 2, and 3. The calculations for each iteration will be as follows:

- When i = 1:
  cc.comb(5 - 3 + 1, 1) = cc.comb(3, 1) = 3 (since there are 3 ways to choose 1 element from 3)
  cc.comb(3 - 1, 1 - 1) = cc.comb(2, 0) = 1 (since there is 1 way to choose 0 elements from 2)
  The product is 3 * 1 % MOD = 3

- When i = 2:
  cc.comb(5 - 3 + 1, 2) = cc.comb(3, 2) = 3 (since there are 3 ways to choose 2 elements from 3)
  cc.comb(3 - 1, 2 - 1) = cc.comb(2, 1) = 2 (since there are 2 ways to choose 1 element from 2)
  The product is 3 * 2 % MOD = 6

- When i = 3:
  cc.comb(5 - 3 + 1, 3) = cc.comb(3, 3) = 1 (since there is 1 way to choose 3 elements from 3)
  cc.comb(3 - 1, 3 - 1) = cc.comb(2, 2) = 1 (since there is 1 way to choose 2 elements from 2)
  The product is 1 * 1 % MOD = 1

The output will be the three numbers printed on separate lines: 3, 6, and 1.
