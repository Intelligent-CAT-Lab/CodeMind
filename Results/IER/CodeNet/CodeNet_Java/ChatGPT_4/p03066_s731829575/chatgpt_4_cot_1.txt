<<<Analysis>>>
The input `3 3` initializes `n` with 3 and `x` with 3. The `Modular` object `mod` is created with a modulus of 998244353. A `Power` object `pow` and a `Combination` object `comb` are also created for later use in the calculations.

The `solve` method of the `DBannedX` class is called with these parameters. An array `occupy` of size `n + 1` (which is 4 in this case) is created to store intermediate results.

The first for loop calculates the number of ways to occupy positions when the sum `S` of occupied positions is less than `x` (which is 3). It iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n` (inclusive). For each `i`, it calculates the number of ways to choose `j` positions from `i` when `j` is less than `two`, which is `x - 1 - i`. The results are accumulated in `occupy[i]`.

The second for loop calculates the number of ways to occupy positions when the sum `S` of occupied positions is greater than or equal to `x`. It iterates over all pairs of `j` and `k` such that `j + k = i` and `j` is less than or equal to `i`. Depending on the values of `j`, `k`, and `two`, it updates `occupy[i]` with the number of additional combinations.

After populating the `occupy` array, the final answer is calculated by iterating over `occupy` and multiplying each `occupy[i]` by the number of combinations of `n` taken `i` at a time, then summing these products modulo the modulus.

The `debug` object is used to print intermediate results when debugging is enabled, but it is not enabled in this case.

Finally, the answer is printed to the output.

Let's calculate the values manually:

For `n = 3` and `x = 3`, the first loop will calculate the number of ways to occupy positions for `S < 3`. Since `S` can only be 0, 1, or 2, and we cannot choose a negative number of positions, `occupy[i]` will be 0 for all `i`.

The second loop will calculate for `S >= 3`. For `i = 0`, there are no positions to occupy, so `occupy[0]` remains 0. For `i = 1`, there is one position, and it can be occupied in one way if `S` is 3. For `i = 2`, there are two positions, and they can be occupied in one way if `S` is 3. For `i = 3`, all positions can be occupied in one way.

So, `occupy` will be `[0, 1, 1, 1]`.

The final answer is calculated as follows:
- `ans += occupy[0] * comb(3, 0) = 0`
- `ans += occupy[1] * comb(3, 1) = 1 * 3 = 3`
- `ans += occupy[2] * comb(3, 2) = 1 * 3 = 3`
- `ans += occupy[3] * comb(3, 3) = 1 * 1 = 1`

Adding these up gives `ans = 0 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 7`.

Therefore, the final output is `7`.
