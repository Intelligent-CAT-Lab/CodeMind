<<<Analysis>>>
The variable M is initialized with 21 according to the input.
The code calculates the result by subtracting M from 24 and then adding 24 to the result of the subtraction.
So, the calculation is (24 - 21) + 24 which equals 3 + 24.
The final result is 27.
The code then prints the value of the result variable.
<<<Output>>>
