<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `data` of size 3 and a variable `sum` with 0. It then enters a for loop to read 3 integers from the input and stores them in the `data` array. The input provided is `1 6 3`.

After reading the input, the array `data` contains the elements [1, 6, 3]. The code then sorts the array using `Arrays.sort(data)`, which results in the array [1, 3, 6].

Next, the code calculates the sum of the absolute differences between the middle element and its neighbors. The middle element after sorting is `data[1]`, which is 3.

The first part of the sum is the absolute difference between `data[1]` and `data[0]`, which is `|3 - 1| = 2`.

The second part of the sum is the absolute difference between `data[1]` and `data[2]`, which is `|3 - 6| = 3`.

The total sum is `2 + 3 = 5`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `sum`, which is 5.

<<<Output>>>
5
