<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `3`, which is assigned to the variable `n`. The code first checks if `n` is equal to 1 or 2 and prints specific outputs for these cases. Since `n` is 3, it skips these checks.

Next, the code enters a for loop starting from `i = 3` and checks if `i * (i - 1) / 2` is equal to `n`. When `i` is 3, `i * (i - 1) / 2` equals `3 * 2 / 2`, which is `3`. Since this is equal to `n`, the loop breaks and `k` is set to `i`, which is `3`.

The code then prints "Yes" because it found a `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2` equals `n`.

The code initializes `ansList` as an ArrayList of ArrayLists with size `k` (which is 3), and an array `target` of size `k` with values `[0, 1, 2]`.

The `combination` method is called with `target`, `k = 2`, and an empty list. This method generates all combinations of size 2 from the `target` array and for each combination, it increments `v` and adds `v` to the corresponding lists in `ansList`.

The `combination` method will generate the following combinations and increment `v` each time:
- Combination `[0, 1]` -> `v = 1`, add `1` to `ansList.get(0)` and `ansList.get(1)`
- Combination `[0, 2]` -> `v = 2`, add `2` to `ansList.get(0)` and `ansList.get(2)`
- Combination `[1, 2]` -> `v = 3`, add `3` to `ansList.get(1)` and `ansList.get(2)`

After the combinations are generated, the code prints `k` (which is 3) and then iterates over `ansList` to print each list in the format specified by the problem. The lists in `ansList` are now:
- `ansList.get(0)` contains `[1, 2]`
- `ansList.get(1)` contains `[1, 3]`
- `ansList.get(2)` contains `[2, 3]`

The output will be the size of each list (which is `k - 1`, or `2`) followed by the elements of the list, separated by spaces.
