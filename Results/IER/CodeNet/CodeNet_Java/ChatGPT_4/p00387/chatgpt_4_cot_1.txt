<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `solve` method that takes an instance of `FastScanner`, `PrintWriter`, and `Methods`. The `solve` method reads two integers `a` and `b` using the `FastScanner` instance, and then prints the result of `Math.max(1, (b+a-1)/a)`.

The `FastScanner` class is a custom input reader that reads input from `System.in`. It provides methods to read different types of data, such as `nextInt`, `nextLong`, `nextDouble`, etc.

Given the input `3 5`, the `solve` method will execute the following steps:
1. Read `a` as 3 and `b` as 5.
2. Calculate `(b+a-1)/a`, which is `(5+3-1)/3` = `7/3` = `2` (since it's integer division).
3. Use `Math.max(1, 2)` which will return `2` because it's the larger of the two values.
4. Print the result, which is `2`.

The `Methods` and `PrintWriter` classes are not used in this code execution.
