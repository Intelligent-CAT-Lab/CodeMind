<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes four integer variables t1, t2, r1, and r2 with the input values 9, 8, 1000, and 999 respectively.
It then checks if either r1 or r2 is equal to -1. Since neither is -1, the code skips the if block that would set r1 to -t1 and r2 to -t2.
Next, it compares r1 and r2. Since r1 (1000) is not equal to r2 (999), it moves to the else if block.
The else if block checks if r1 is less than r2. Since r1 (1000) is greater than r2 (999), it skips this block.
Finally, the else block is executed, and "Alice" is printed because r1 is greater than r2.
<<<Output>>>
Alice
