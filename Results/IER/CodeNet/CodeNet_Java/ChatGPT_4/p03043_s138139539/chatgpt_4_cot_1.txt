The variables n and k are initialized with 3 and 10 respectively according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0.0 to store the final result.

The for loop iterates from 1 to 3 (inclusive) to calculate the probability for each integer i in this range. Inside the loop, a variable p is initialized with 1.0 to represent the probability, and a temporary variable tmp is assigned the value of i.

For each i, a while loop is executed as long as tmp is less than k (10 in this case). Inside the while loop, p is halved (p *= 0.5) and tmp is doubled (tmp *= 2). This represents the probability of reaching at least k by doubling the number i.

For i = 1:
- p starts at 1.0, tmp is 1.
- tmp < k, so p becomes 0.5 and tmp becomes 2.
- tmp < k, so p becomes 0.25 and tmp becomes 4.
- tmp < k, so p becomes 0.125 and tmp becomes 8.
- tmp < k, so p becomes 0.0625 and tmp becomes 16.
- Now tmp is not less than k, so the while loop ends.
- ans += 0.0625 / 3.

For i = 2:
- p starts at 1.0, tmp is 2.
- tmp < k, so p becomes 0.5 and tmp becomes 4.
- tmp < k, so p becomes 0.25 and tmp becomes 8.
- tmp < k, so p becomes 0.125 and tmp becomes 16.
- Now tmp is not less than k, so the while loop ends.
- ans += 0.125 / 3.

For i = 3:
- p starts at 1.0, tmp is 3.
- tmp < k, so p becomes 0.5 and tmp becomes 6.
- tmp < k, so p becomes 0.25 and tmp becomes 12.
- Now tmp is not less than k, so the while loop ends.
- ans += 0.25 / 3.

Finally, the sum of these probabilities is:
ans = (0.0625 / 3) + (0.125 / 3) + (0.25 / 3)
ans = 0.020833333333333332 + 0.041666666666666664 + 0.08333333333333333
ans = 0.14583333333333331

The final value of ans is printed as the output, which is 0.14583333333333331.
