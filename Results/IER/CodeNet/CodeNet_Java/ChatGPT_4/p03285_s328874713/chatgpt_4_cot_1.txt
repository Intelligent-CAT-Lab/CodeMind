<<<Analysis>>>
The input N is initialized with the value 11. The program checks if N is divisible by 4 or 7. Since 11 is not divisible by either 4 or 7, the program enters the else block.

Inside the else block, there is a for loop that starts with i = 4 and increments i by 4 on each iteration, and it runs until i is less than N (11 in this case). The loop checks if the difference (N - i) is divisible by 7. For i = 4, (N - i) is 7, which is divisible by 7. Therefore, the flag is set to true, and the loop breaks.

After the loop, the program checks the flag. Since the flag is true, the program prints "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
