<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and goal are initialized with 3, 0, and 10 respectively according to the input. The variable day is initialized with 1 and variable coin with 0.

The program enters a while loop that continues as long as coin is less than goal (10 in this case). Inside the loop, the following steps occur:

1. On day 1, coin is increased by a (3), so coin becomes 3.
2. On day 2, coin is increased by a (3), so coin becomes 6.
3. On day 3, coin is increased by a (3), so coin becomes 9.
4. On day 4, coin is increased by a (3), so coin becomes 12.

Since b is 0, the additional coins added every 7th day do not affect the total.

The loop exits when coin is not less than goal, which happens after day 4 when coin reaches 12. The program then prints day - 1, which is 4 - 1 = 3.
