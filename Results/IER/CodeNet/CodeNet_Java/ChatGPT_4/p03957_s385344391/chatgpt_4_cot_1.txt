<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "CODEFESTIVAL" is converted to a character array and stored in the variable arr. The variable beforeC is initialized to true, which is used to track whether the character 'C' has been encountered in the array.

The program then enters a for-each loop to iterate over each character in the array. Initially, beforeC is true, so the program is looking for the first occurrence of the character 'C'. When the character 'C' is found, beforeC is set to false, indicating that the character 'C' has been encountered and the program should now look for the character 'F'.

The loop continues to iterate over the characters. Since beforeC is now false, the program is looking for the character 'F'. When the character 'F' is found, the program prints "Yes" and returns, ending the execution.

In the given input "CODEFESTIVAL", the character 'C' is found at the fourth position, and the character 'F' is found at the sixth position. Since both conditions are met (finding 'C' before 'F'), the program will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
