The code is designed to calculate the area (s), the perimeter (l), and the height (h) of a right-angled triangle given the lengths of two sides (a and b) and the angle (cc) between them in degrees. The input provided is `4 3 90`, which means a=4, b=3, and cc=90 degrees.

First, the angle cc is converted from degrees to radians using Math.toRadians(cc) because the Math.sin and Math.cos functions in Java expect the angle in radians.

The area (s) is calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle: (base * height) / 2. Since it's a right-angled triangle and the angle is 90 degrees, side a and b are the base and height, respectively. Therefore, s = 4 * 3 * Math.sin(Math.toRadians(90)) / 2.0. Since sin(90 degrees) is 1, the area s = 4 * 3 * 1 / 2.0 = 6.0.

The perimeter (l) is calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a triangle: side1 + side2 + side3. Since we have a right-angled triangle, the third side can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem or the law of cosines. Here, the law of cosines is used: c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)). So, l = 4 + 3 + Math.sqrt(4 * 4 + 3 * 3 - 2.0 * 4 * 3 * Math.cos(Math.toRadians(90))). Since cos(90 degrees) is 0, the third side is simply the square root of (4^2 + 3^2), which is 5. Therefore, l = 4 + 3 + 5 = 12.0.

The height (h) is the length of side b projected perpendicularly to side a. Since the angle is 90 degrees, the height is simply side b. Therefore, h = 3 * Math.sin(Math.toRadians(90)) = 3 * 1 = 3.0.

The output will be the values of s, l, and h printed on separate lines.
