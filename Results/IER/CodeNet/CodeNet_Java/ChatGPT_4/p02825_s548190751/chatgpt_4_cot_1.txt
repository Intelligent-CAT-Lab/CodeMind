<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a single integer `6`. The program is designed to fill a square matrix of size `n x n` with characters in a specific pattern, depending on the value of `n`.

1. The `solve` method reads the integer `n` as `6`.
2. It checks if `n` is equal to `2`, which it is not, so it does not print `-1` and continues.
3. It initializes a 2D character array `ans` of size `6x6` and fills it with dots.
4. It checks if `n % 3 == 0`, which is true for `n = 6`, so it enters the first `if` block.
5. Inside the `if` block, it iterates over the matrix in steps of `3` and calls the `fill3` method to fill the matrix with the pattern for `3x3` blocks.
6. The `fill3` method fills the characters in the following pattern for each `3x3` block:
   ```
   ..a
   b..
   .b.
   ```
7. Since `n` is `6`, which is divisible by `3`, the `fill3` method will be called twice to fill two `3x3` blocks in the `6x6` matrix.
8. After filling the matrix, the `printAns` method is called to print the matrix.

The expected output is a `6x6` matrix with two `3x3` patterns as described above.
