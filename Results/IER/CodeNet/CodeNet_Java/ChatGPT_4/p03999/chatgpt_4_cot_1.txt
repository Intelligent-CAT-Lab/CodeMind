The input string `s` is initialized with "125". The variable `ans` is initialized with 0.

The outer loop variable `dx` iterates from 0 to the length of the string `s` minus 1, which is 2 in this case. So `dx` will take values 0, 1, and 2.

The inner loop variable `start` iterates from 0 to `s.length() - 1 - dx`. For each value of `dx`, the range of `start` will be different.

For `dx = 0`, `start` will iterate from 0 to 2, and the substrings will be "1", "2", and "5". The `helper` function will return 1 for both calls since `n` will be 0 in both cases. So, the sum of these substrings multiplied by the helper function results will be 1*1*1 + 2*1*1 + 5*1*1 = 8.

For `dx = 1`, `start` will iterate from 0 to 1, and the substrings will be "12" and "25". The `helper` function will return 1 for the first call and 1 for the second call in both cases (since `n` is 1 for the first call and 0 for the second call). So, the sum of these substrings multiplied by the helper function results will be 12*1*1 + 25*1*1 = 37.

For `dx = 2`, `start` will iterate only once with value 0, and the substring will be "125". The `helper` function will return 1 for both calls since `n` will be 0 in both cases. So, the sum of this substring multiplied by the helper function results will be 125*1*1 = 125.

Adding all these sums together: 8 + 37 + 125 = 170.

Therefore, the final value of `ans` will be 170, which is the output of the program.
