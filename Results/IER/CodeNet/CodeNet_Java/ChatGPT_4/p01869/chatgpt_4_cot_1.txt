<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a method `solve()` that is designed to process a long integer `n` and find the maximum sum of the function `func()` applied to pairs of divisors of `n` where each divisor is composed only of the digits 8 and 2. The `func()` method uses a HashMap `hash` to memoize results for efficiency.

The `solve()` method reads a long integer `n` from the input. If `n` is 1, it immediately prints `-1` and returns, as 1 cannot have any divisors other than itself, and it does not consist of the digits 8 or 2.

Since the input is `1`, the condition `if (n == 1)` is true, and the code will execute the block inside this condition, which prints `-1` and then returns from the `solve()` method. The rest of the code in `solve()` and the recursive `func()` method will not be executed for this input.

Therefore, the output will be `-1`.
