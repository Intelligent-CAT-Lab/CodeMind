<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that uses a `Scanner` to read input lines and a `Consumer` to process the input.

1. The `main` method calls `readInput()` which reads input lines until there are no more lines to read. In this case, it reads one line with the input `3776`.

2. The `readInput()` method returns a `List<String>` containing the input lines, which is then passed to the `consumer`'s `accept` method.

3. The `solve()` method returns a `Consumer<List<String>>` that contains a lambda expression. This lambda expression processes the list of input strings.

4. Inside the lambda expression, a boolean variable `ans` is initialized to `false`.

5. A for loop runs from 0 to 2 (inclusive) to check if any two consecutive characters in the first string of the list are the same.

6. The expression `args.get(0).charAt(i) == args.get(0).charAt(i + 1)` checks if the character at index `i` is the same as the character at index `i + 1` in the first string of the list.

7. The `|=` operator is a bitwise inclusive OR assignment operator, which in this context is used to set `ans` to `true` if any of the comparisons return `true`.

8. After the loop, if `ans` is `true`, it means there were two consecutive characters that were the same, and "Bad" is printed. Otherwise, "Good" is printed.

9. For the input `3776`, the loop will check characters at indices (0,1), (1,2), and (2,3). The comparison will be true for indices (1,2) because both characters are '7'.

10. Since `ans` becomes `true`, the output will be "Bad".
