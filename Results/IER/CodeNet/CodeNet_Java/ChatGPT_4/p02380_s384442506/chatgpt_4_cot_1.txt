<<<Analysis>>>
The input "4 3 90" is read and split into three strings "4", "3", and "90", which are then parsed into double values and stored in variables a, b, and angle respectively. The angle is 90 degrees, which is a special case in the code.

Since the angle is exactly 90 degrees, the code enters the if block. The area of the right-angled triangle is calculated using the formula (a*b/2), which is (4*3/2) = 6.0. The circumference (or perimeter) of the triangle is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse (sqrt(a^2 + b^2)) and then adding all sides together, which is (sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) + 4 + 3) = (5 + 4 + 3) = 12.0. The height, in the case of a right-angled triangle with the angle of 90 degrees between sides a and b, is simply the side b, which is 3.0.

The code then prints out the calculated area, circumference, and height, each on a new line.
