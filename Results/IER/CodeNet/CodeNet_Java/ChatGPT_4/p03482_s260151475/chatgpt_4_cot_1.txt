The input "010" is read and converted to a character array S of {'0', '1', '0'}. The length of S, n, is 3.

An integer array s of length n is created and populated with the numeric values of the characters in S, resulting in s = {0, 1, 0}.

An integer array sum of length n+1 is created to store the prefix sums of array s. The prefix sums are calculated, resulting in sum = {0, 0, 1, 1}.

A lambda function cannotFlip is defined to determine if it's possible to flip a substring of length k. The function checks various conditions based on the value of k and the prefix sums in the sum array.

The BinarySearch.binarySearch method is called with the cannotFlip function. This method performs a binary search to find the smallest k for which cannotFlip returns true.

The binary search starts with tooSmall = 0 and tooBig = 1, and doubles tooBig until cannotFlip returns true. Since cannotFlip(tooSmall) is false and cannotFlip(tooBig) is true for tooBig = 2, the binary search continues.

The binary search checks the midpoint between tooSmall and tooBig. Since cannotFlip(1) is false, tooSmall is updated to 1. The next midpoint is (1 + 2) / 2 = 1 (integer division), and since cannotFlip(1) is still false, tooSmall remains 1.

The binary search ends when tooBig - tooSmall <= 1. At this point, tooBig is the smallest k for which cannotFlip returns true, which is 2.

The final answer is tooBig - 1, which is 2 - 1 = 1.

The output is the value of answer, which is 1.
