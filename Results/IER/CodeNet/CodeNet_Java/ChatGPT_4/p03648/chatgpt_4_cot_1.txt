<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `0`. The variable K is initialized with 0. Then, A is calculated as K/50, which is 0/50, resulting in A being 0. B is calculated as K%50, which is 0%50, resulting in B being 0.

An array a of size 50 is created, and a for loop initializes each element of the array with its index plus A. Since A is 0, each element of a will be initialized to its index value.

Since B is 0, the second for loop that decrements from 49 to 49-B (which is 49) will not execute because the condition i>49-B is false from the start.

The program then prints the number 50, followed by the elements of the array a, each followed by a space except for the last element. Since the array a contains the numbers from 0 to 49, these numbers will be printed.
