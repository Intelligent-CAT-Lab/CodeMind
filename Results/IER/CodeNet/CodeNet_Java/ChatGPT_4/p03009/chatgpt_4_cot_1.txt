<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 2 1` initializes the variables n, h, and d with 2, 2, and 1 respectively.

The `NumberTheory.Modular` class is instantiated with a modulus of 1e9 + 7 (1000000007).

The `NumberTheory.Factorial` class is instantiated with a limit of n (2) and the modular instance. It calculates the factorial of numbers from 0 to n and their modular inverses.

The `dp` array is initialized with a size of h + 1 (3). `dp[0]` is set to the factorial of n, which is 2! = 2 * 1 = 2.

The variable `factSum` is initialized to 0 and then a loop calculates the sum of factorials from 1 to n (2) under the modulus. The sum is 1! + 2! = 1 + 2 = 3.

The `preDpSum` array is initialized with a size of h + 1 (3). `preDpSum[0]` is set to `dp[0]`, which is 2.

A loop iterates from 1 to h (2), calculating the `dp` values and updating `preDpSum` accordingly.

For i = 1:
- `dp[1]` is set to `preDpSum[0]` which is 2.
- Since i - d - 1 (1 - 1 - 1) is not greater than or equal to 0, the if condition is not executed.
- `dp[1]` is multiplied by `factSum` (3) under the modulus, resulting in 6.
- `preDpSum[1]` is set to `preDpSum[0]` + `dp[1]` which is 2 + 6 = 8.

For i = 2:
- `dp[2]` is set to `preDpSum[1]` which is 8.
- Since i - d - 1 (2 - 1 - 1) is equal to 0, `dp[2]` is subtracted by `preDpSum[0]` which is 2, resulting in 6.
- Since i is equal to h, the if condition to multiply `dp[i]` by `factSum` is not executed.
- `preDpSum[2]` is set to `preDpSum[1]` + `dp[2]` which is 8 + 6 = 14.

Finally, `dp[h]` which is `dp[2]` is printed, and its value is 6.
