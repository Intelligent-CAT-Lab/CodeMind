<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is `(()())---)`. The program processes each character of the string one by one.

1. The first character is `(`. It increases the depth to 1 and pushes 0 onto the elements stack. The undo stack gets the OPEN runnable.
   Output: 0

2. The second character is `(`. It increases the depth to 2 and pushes 0 onto the elements stack. The undo stack gets the OPEN runnable.
   Output: 0

3. The third character is `)`. It decreases the depth to 1, pops 0 from the elements stack, pushes the popped value onto the elementsBefore stack, and increments the top of the elements stack by 1 (0+1). The undo stack gets the VALID_UNDO runnable. The ans is incremented by the top of the elements stack (1).
   Output: 1

4. The fourth character is `(`. It increases the depth to 2 and pushes 0 onto the elements stack. The undo stack gets the OPEN runnable.
   Output: 1

5. The fifth character is `)`. It decreases the depth to 1, pops 0 from the elements stack, pushes the popped value onto the elementsBefore stack, and increments the top of the elements stack by 1 (1+1). The undo stack gets the VALID_UNDO runnable. The ans is incremented by the top of the elements stack (2).
   Output: 3

6. The sixth character is `)`. It decreases the depth to 0, pops 2 from the elements stack, pushes the popped value onto the elementsBefore stack, and increments the top of the elements stack by 1 (1+1). The undo stack gets the VALID_UNDO runnable. The ans is incremented by the top of the elements stack (2).
   Output: 5

7. The seventh character is `-`. It triggers the undo operation, which pops the last state from the oldStates stack and sets ans and depth to the values from that state. The last undo operation (VALID_UNDO) is run, which decrements the top of the elements stack by 1 (2-1) and pushes the last value from elementsBefore (2) onto the elements stack.
   Output: 3

8. The eighth character is `-`. It triggers the undo operation, which pops the last state from the oldStates stack and sets ans and depth to the values from that state. The last undo operation (VALID_UNDO) is run, which decrements the top of the elements stack by 1 (1-1) and pushes the last value from elementsBefore (0) onto the elements stack.
   Output: 1

9. The ninth character is `-`. It triggers the undo operation, which pops the last state from the oldStates stack and sets ans and depth to the values from that state. The last undo operation (OPEN) is run, which does nothing as it just pops the top of the elements stack.
   Output: 0

10. The tenth character is `)`. It decreases the depth to -1 (which is then set to 0), pops 0 from the elements stack, pushes the popped value onto the elementsBefore stack, and pushes 0 onto the elements stack because the depth is less than 0. The undo stack gets the INVALID_UNDO runnable. The ans is incremented by the top of the elements stack (0).
    Output: 0

The output is the value of ans printed after each character is processed.
