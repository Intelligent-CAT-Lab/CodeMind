The input is `6`, which initializes the variable `k` with the value 6. The `dist` array is initialized with size 6, and all its elements are set to `INF` (1001001001). The graph `g` is initialized with 6 empty `ArrayList<Edge>`.

For each vertex `i` from 0 to 5, two edges are added to the graph:
- An edge from `i` to `(i+1)%k` with cost 1.
- An edge from `i` to `(i*10)%k` with cost 0.

The `calc` method is called with the parameter `1`. A priority queue `q` is initialized, and a new `P` object with vertex `1` and distance `0` is added to it. The distance to vertex `1` is set to `0`.

The priority queue is processed with a while loop until it is empty. In each iteration, the vertex `p` with the smallest distance is polled from the queue. If the current distance in `dist[p.v]` is less than `p.dist`, the loop continues to the next iteration.

For each edge `e` from the current vertex `p.v`, if the distance to the target vertex `e.to` is greater than the sum of the current distance `dist[p.v]` and the edge cost `e.cost`, the distance to `e.to` is updated, and a new `P` object with updated distance is added to the queue.

The process continues until the queue is empty. The final distance to vertex `0` is printed, incremented by 1.

Let's simulate the process:
- Initially, `dist` is `[INF, 0, INF, INF, INF, INF]`.
- The queue starts with `[(1, 0)]`.
- Poll `(1, 0)`, update `dist` to `[INF, 0, INF, INF, INF, INF]`, add `(2, 1)` and `(1, 0)` to the queue.
- Poll `(1, 0)`, but since `dist[1]` is not greater than `p.dist`, continue.
- Poll `(2, 1)`, update `dist` to `[INF, 0, 1, INF, INF, INF]`, add `(3, 2)` and `(2, 1)` to the queue.
- Poll `(2, 1)`, but since `dist[2]` is not greater than `p.dist`, continue.
- Poll `(3, 2)`, update `dist` to `[INF, 0, 1, 2, INF, INF]`, add `(4, 3)` and `(3, 2)` to the queue.
- Poll `(3, 2)`, but since `dist[3]` is not greater than `p.dist`, continue.
- Poll `(4, 3)`, update `dist` to `[INF, 0, 1, 2, 3, INF]`, add `(5, 4)` and `(4, 3)` to the queue.
- Poll `(4, 3)`, but since `dist[4]` is not greater than `p.dist`, continue.
- Poll `(5, 4)`, update `dist` to `[INF, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, add `(0, 5)` and `(5, 4)` to the queue.
- Poll `(5, 4)`, but since `dist[5]` is not greater than `p.dist`, continue.
- Poll `(0, 5)`, update `dist` to `[5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, no new vertices are added since `(0*10)%6` is 0 and `(0+1)%6` is 1, but both have already been visited with a shorter path.

Finally, the output is `dist[0]+1`, which is `5+1`.
