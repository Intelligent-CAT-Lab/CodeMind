<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `1 2 1 1`. The `solve_abc178_b()` method is called from the `main` method.

Inside `solve_abc178_b()`, a new `FastScanner` object is created to read the input. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are initialized with the input values 1, 2, 1, and 1 respectively.

The variable `ans` is initialized with the product of `a` and `c`, which is 1 * 1 = 1.

Then, the code finds the maximum value of the product of the pairs of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using `Math.max` method:
- `ans` is updated with the maximum of `ans` and `a * d`, which is the maximum of 1 and 1 * 1 = 1. So `ans` remains 1.
- `ans` is updated with the maximum of `ans` and `b * c`, which is the maximum of 1 and 2 * 1 = 2. So `ans` becomes 2.
- `ans` is updated with the maximum of `ans` and `b * d`, which is the maximum of 2 and 2 * 1 = 2. So `ans` remains 2.

Finally, the value of `ans` is printed, which is 2.
