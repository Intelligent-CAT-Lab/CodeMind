<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method and a `FastScanner` class for reading input. The `main` method creates an instance of `FastScanner` and reads two integers, `X` and `Y`, from the input. In this case, `X` is assigned the value 81 and `Y` is assigned the value 58.

The `main` method then creates a `PrintWriter` object for output and prints the result of the expression `X + (Y/2)`. The division of `Y` by 2 is integer division, so the result will be the integer part of `Y/2`, which is 58/2 = 29.

The final result printed will be the value of `X` plus the integer division of `Y` by 2, which is 81 + 29 = 110.

The `PrintWriter` is then flushed to ensure the output is sent to `System.out`.
