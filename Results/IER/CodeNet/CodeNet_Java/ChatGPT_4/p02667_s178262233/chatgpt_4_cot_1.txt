<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "1101" is converted to a character array `vals`. The `tot` variable is initialized to 0, and two arrays `par` and `nextPar` are declared. The variable `ones` is used to count the number of '1's in the input, and `ans` is used to accumulate the total score.

The for loop iterates over each character in `vals`. For each character, `ans` is incremented by `i / 2 + 1`. When a '0' is encountered, the `par` array at index `tot` is set to `true` if the number of '1's encountered so far (`ones`) is odd, otherwise it is set to `false`. The `tot` variable is then incremented. When a '1' is encountered, `ones` is incremented.

After the loop, `tot` is 2 because there are two '0's in the input. The `par` array is `[true, false]` because the first '0' has an odd number of '1's before it and the second '0' has an even number of '1's before it.

The `nextPar` and `minus` arrays are initialized with a length of `tot + 1`, which is 3 in this case.

The `calc` function is called with `pos` set to 0 and `inv` set to `false`. This function is a recursive function that calculates the values for the `minus` and `nextPar` arrays. The base case is when `pos` equals `tot`, at which point the function returns without doing anything.

The `calc` function will process the `par` array and calculate the `minus` and `nextPar` values based on the parity of the '0's and whether they need to be inverted (`inv`).

After the recursive calls, the `minus` array will contain the values that need to be subtracted from `ans` to get the final answer. The `nextPar` array will contain the number of parity inversions needed from the current position to the end of the array.

Finally, the program prints `ans - minus[0]`, which is the total score minus the adjustments calculated by the `calc` function.

Let's calculate the values manually:

- Initial `ans` is 6 because the loop adds 1 for the first character, 2 for the second, 2 for the third, and 1 for the fourth.
- `calc` is called with `pos = 0` and `inv = false`. Since `par[0]` is `true` and `inv` is `false`, it calls `calc(1, true)`.
- `calc` is called with `pos = 1` and `inv = true`. Since `par[1]` is `false` and `inv` is `true`, it calls `calc(2, false)`.
- `calc` is called with `pos = 2` and `inv = false`. This is the base case, so it returns without doing anything.
- Back in the call with `pos = 1`, `minus[1]` is set to `minus[2]` (which is 0) plus `nextPar[2]` (which is 0) plus 1, so `minus[1]` is 1. `nextPar[1]` is set to `tot - pos - 1 - nextPar[2]`, which is `2 - 1 - 1 - 0`, so `nextPar[1]` is 0.
- Back in the call with `pos = 0`, `minus[0]` is set to `minus[1]` (which is 1) plus `nextPar[1]` (which is 0) plus 1, so `minus[0]` is 2. `nextPar[0]` is set to `tot - pos - 1 - nextPar[1]`, which is `2 - 0 - 1 - 0`, so `nextPar[0]` is 1.

The final answer is `ans - minus[0]`, which is `6 - 2`, so the output is 4.
