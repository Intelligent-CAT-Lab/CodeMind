<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main class with a main method that initializes an input stream and an output stream, and then creates instances of LightScanner and LightWriter to handle input and output, respectively. It then creates an instance of the NTL_2_A class and calls its solve method, passing in the LightScanner and LightWriter instances.

The NTL_2_A class has a solve method that reads two big integers from the input using the LightScanner's bigints() method and adds them together using the BigInteger's add method. The result is then converted to a string and printed with a newline using the LightWriter's ansln method.

The LightScanner class is used to read input from the InputStream. It uses a BufferedReader to read lines and a StringTokenizer to tokenize the input into strings. The bigints() method reads a string token and converts it to a BigInteger.

The LightWriter class is used to write output to the OutputStream. It wraps the OutputStream in a BufferedWriter and OutputStreamWriter to write characters and strings efficiently. The ans method is used to write a string, and the ansln method is used to write a string followed by a newline. The ln method writes a system-dependent line separator.

Given the input `5 8`, the LightScanner will read these as two separate tokens and convert them to BigInteger objects. The NTL_2_A's solve method will then add these two BigInteger objects, resulting in the BigInteger representing the number 13. This result is then converted to a string and printed followed by a newline.

<<<Output>>>
13
