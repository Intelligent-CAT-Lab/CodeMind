<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main method and a solve method. The main method sets up the BufferedReader to read from standard input and enters a loop that calls the solve method until there is no more input.

The solve method reads a single integer N using the ni() utility method, which reads the next token from the input and parses it as an integer. The value of N is then used in a calculation where (N - 2) * 180 is computed and printed to the standard output.

Given the input `3`, the solve method will be called once. The value of N will be 3. The calculation performed will be (3 - 2) * 180, which simplifies to 1 * 180, resulting in 180.

After the calculation, the main method checks if there is more input. Since there is no more input, the hasNext flag is set to false, and the program terminates without printing the separator "---".

Therefore, the output of the code execution given the input `3` will be 180.
