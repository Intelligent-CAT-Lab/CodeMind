<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `2 3 1`, which corresponds to the variables n, m, and d respectively. The values of these variables are initialized as follows:
- n = 2
- m = 3
- d = 1

The code then calculates the value of v2 using the formula `Math.max(0, n - d - d)`. Since d is not 0, the code does not change the value of v2. The calculation is as follows:
v2 = Math.max(0, 2 - 1 - 1) = Math.max(0, 0) = 0

Next, the value of v1 is calculated as `n - v2`, which is:
v1 = 2 - 0 = 2

The final output is calculated using the formula `(v2 * 2 + v1) * (m - 1) / Math.pow(n, 2)`, which is:
output = (0 * 2 + 2) * (3 - 1) / Math.pow(2, 2) = 2 * 2 / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1.0

The output is formatted to 10 decimal places, so the final output will be `1.0000000000`.
