<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "ASSA" is converted to a character array `c` with the characters {'A', 'S', 'S', 'A'}.
The array is then sorted using `Arrays.sort(c)`, which results in the sorted array {'A', 'A', 'S', 'S'}.
The sorted array is then checked for the following conditions:
- `c[0] == c[1]` checks if the first and second characters are the same, which is true ('A' == 'A').
- `c[2] == c[3]` checks if the third and fourth characters are the same, which is also true ('S' == 'S').
- `c[0] != c[2]` checks if the first and third characters are different, which is true ('A' != 'S').

Since all conditions are met, the program prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
