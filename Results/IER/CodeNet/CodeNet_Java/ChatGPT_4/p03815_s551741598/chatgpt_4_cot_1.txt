<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with the value 7 according to the input.
The first if condition checks if X is less than or equal to 6, which is false for the input 7.
The else if condition checks if X is less than or equal to 11, which is true for the input 7.
Since the else if condition is true, the program prints 2 and does not execute the else block.
<<<Output>>>
2
