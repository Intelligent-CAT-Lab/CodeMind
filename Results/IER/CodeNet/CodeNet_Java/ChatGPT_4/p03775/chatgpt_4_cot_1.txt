The input is `10000`, which is assigned to the variable `N` in the `AtCoder` class constructor.

The `solve` method is called with a `PrintWriter` object. It calculates the square root of `N` (10000) and assigns it to `sqrt`, which is `100`.

A for loop starts with `i` equal to `sqrt` (100) and decrements `i` until it reaches 1. In each iteration, it checks if `N` is divisible by `i` without a remainder.

The first value of `i` that divides `N` without a remainder is `100` itself, because `10000 / 100 = 100`, and `10000 % 100 = 0`.

The lengths of the string representations of `i` and `N / i` are calculated. Both `i` and `N / i` are `100`, so their string representations are both "100", which have a length of 3.

The maximum of these two lengths is `3`, which is then printed out.

The method returns after printing, so the loop does not continue.

Therefore, the output will be `3`.
