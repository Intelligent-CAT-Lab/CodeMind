<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input, which are 9 and 12, and assigns them to variables str1 and str2 respectively. It then calculates the sum of these two integers and assigns the result to the variable kei, which in this case is 9 + 12 = 21.

Next, the code checks if the value of kei is less than 24. Since 21 is less than 24, the condition is true, and the code executes the first branch of the if statement, printing the value of kei.

Therefore, the output will be the value of kei, which is 21.
<<<Output>>>
21
