<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer from the input, which is `3` in this case, and assigns it to the variable `n`. It then calculates the expression `(n - 2) * 180`, which is a formula for finding the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with `n` sides (in this case, a triangle). The calculation is as follows:
(3 - 2) * 180 = 1 * 180 = 180
The result of the calculation is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
180
