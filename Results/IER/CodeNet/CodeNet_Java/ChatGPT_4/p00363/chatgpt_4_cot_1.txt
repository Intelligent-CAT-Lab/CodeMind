<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided initializes W with 3, H with 3, and c with "B". The variables x and y are calculated as (W - 1) / 2 and (H - 1) / 2, which results in both x and y being 1.

The program then enters a nested for loop to iterate over each cell in a grid of width W and height H. The outer loop runs for H iterations (3 times in this case), and the inner loop runs for W iterations (also 3 times in this case).

The conditions inside the loops determine what character to print at each cell:

- If the cell is one of the four corners of the grid (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), it prints a "+".
- If the cell is on the top or bottom edge, but not a corner, it prints a "-".
- If the cell is on the left or right edge, but not a corner, it prints a "|".
- If the cell is at the center of the grid (determined by the variables x and y), it prints the character "B".
- For all other cells, it prints a ".".

Given the input `3 3 B`, the grid is 3x3, so the output will be a 3x3 grid with "+" at the corners, "-" and "|" on the edges, and "B" at the center.
