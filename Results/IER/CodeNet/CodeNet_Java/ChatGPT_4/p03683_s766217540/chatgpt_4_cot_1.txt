<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `2 2`. The variables `n` and `m` are initialized with the value 2 each. The variable `lim` is initialized with the value 1000000007.

The variable `d` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, which is `0` in this case.

The variable `ans` is initialized with the value 1.

The code then checks if `d` is greater than or equal to 2. Since `d` is `0`, it does not satisfy the condition, so the code does not set `ans` to 0.

The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, which is 2 in this case. During each iteration, `ans` is multiplied by the loop index `i` and then checked if it is greater than or equal to `lim`. If it is, `ans` is taken modulo `lim`.

After the loop, `ans` is squared and taken modulo `lim` again. Since `n` is equal to `m`, the code multiplies `ans` by 2 and takes modulo `lim` one more time.

The final value of `ans` is calculated as follows:
- `ans` starts at 1.
- Loop iteration for `i = 1`: `ans` becomes `1 * 1 = 1`.
- Loop iteration for `i = 2`: `ans` becomes `1 * 2 = 2`.
- `ans` is squared: `2 * 2 = 4`.
- Since `n` is equal to `m`, `ans` is multiplied by 2: `4 * 2 = 8`.
- `ans` is taken modulo `lim`: `8 % 1000000007 = 8`.

The final value of `ans` is 8, which is printed as the output.
