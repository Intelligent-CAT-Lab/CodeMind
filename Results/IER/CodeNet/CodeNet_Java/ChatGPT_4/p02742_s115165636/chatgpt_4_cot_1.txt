<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that creates an instance of `Main` and calls its `run` method. The `run` method uses a `FastScanner` instance to read two long integers, `H` and `W`, from the standard input.

The `FastScanner` class is designed to read input efficiently. It reads chunks of data into a buffer and processes it byte by byte. The `nextLong` method is used to read the next long integer from the input.

After reading `H` and `W`, the code checks if `H` is greater than `W`. If it is, it swaps the values of `H` and `W` using bitwise XOR operations. This ensures that `H` is less than or equal to `W`.

Next, the code checks if `H` is not equal to 1. If `H` is not equal to 1, it calculates the result using the formula `((W+1)/2)*((H+1)/2)+(W/2)*(H/2)` and prints the result. This formula is used to calculate the number of ways to divide a grid of size `H` by `W` into two parts with as equal an area as possible.

If `H` is equal to 1, it prints `1`, which means there is only one way to divide a grid of size `1` by `W`.

Given the input `4 5`, the values of `H` and `W` are already in the correct order (since `4` is not greater than `5`), so no swapping is needed. Since `H` is not equal to 1, the code calculates the result as follows:
- `((W+1)/2)*((H+1)/2)` becomes `((5+1)/2)*((4+1)/2)` which is `3*2.5` which is `7.5`. Since we are dealing with integer division, the decimal part is truncated, so it becomes `7`.
- `(W/2)*(H/2)` becomes `(5/2)*(4/2)` which is `2*2` which is `4`.

Adding these two results together gives `7 + 4` which is `11`.

Therefore, the output of the code execution will be `11`.
