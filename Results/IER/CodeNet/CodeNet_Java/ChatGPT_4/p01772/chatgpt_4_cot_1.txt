<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "AIZUNYANPEROPERO" is converted to a character array `c` with length `n` which is 16. A new `StringBuilder` object `s` is created.

The first for loop iterates over the character array `c` and appends only the characters 'A' or 'Z' to the `StringBuilder` `s`. After this loop, `s` will contain "AZ".

The character array `c` is then updated to contain the characters of `s` and `n` is updated to the new length of `c`, which is now 2.

A new `StringBuilder` `s` is created again. The second for loop iterates over the updated character array `c` and appends characters to `s` only if `s` is empty or the last character in `s` is not equal to the current character in `c`. Since `s` is empty initially, both 'A' and 'Z' are appended to `s`. After this loop, `s` will still contain "AZ".

The following conditional checks are then performed:
- If `s` has a length greater than 0 and the first character is 'Z', it is removed. This condition is not met, so no character is removed.
- If `s` has a length greater than 0 and the last character is 'A', it is removed. This condition is not met, so no character is removed.

Since `s` has a length greater than 0, the content of `s` is printed, which is "AZ".

AZ
