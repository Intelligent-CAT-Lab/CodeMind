<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that creates an `InputReader` to read from `System.in` and a `PrintWriter` to write to `System.out`. It then creates an instance of `TaskX` and calls its `solve` method.

The `solve` method reads two integers `m` and `n` using the `InputReader` and then prints the result of `power(m, n, modP)`.

The `power` method calculates `a` raised to the power of `e` modulo `modP` using the binary exponentiation algorithm. It initializes `ret` to 1 and iterates while `e` is greater than 0. In each iteration, if `e` is odd, it multiplies `ret` by `a` modulo `modP`. It then squares `a` modulo `modP` and halves `e`.

Given the input `2 3`, the `solve` method will call `power(2, 3, 1000000007)`. The `power` method will work as follows:
- Initialize `ret` to 1.
- Since `e` is 3, which is odd, `ret` becomes `(1 * 2) % 1000000007` which is 2.
- `a` becomes `(2 * 2) % 1000000007` which is 4, and `e` becomes `3 / 2` which is 1.
- Since `e` is 1, which is odd, `ret` becomes `(2 * 4) % 1000000007` which is 8.
- `a` becomes `(4 * 4) % 1000000007` which is 16, and `e` becomes `1 / 2` which is 0.
- The loop ends because `e` is now 0.

The final result is `ret` which is 8. This is the value that will be printed by the `solve` method.
