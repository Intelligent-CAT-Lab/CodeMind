<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "3-2*3" is read and an "=" is appended to it, resulting in "3-2*3=".
The variable `now` is initialized to 0, and `max` is initialized to the smallest possible value for a long in Java.

The program then calculates the expression in different orders of operations by calling various methods. Each method represents a different precedence of the operators '+', '-', and '*'. The `now` variable is reset to 0 before each new calculation to start parsing the expression from the beginning.

The `expression` method calculates the expression with equal precedence for all operators. The `expression12` and `expression21` methods calculate the expression with different precedences, where `expression12` gives precedence to '+' over '-' and '*', and `expression21` gives precedence to '-' over '+' and '*'. The `ex1`, `ex2`, and `ex3` methods also calculate the expression with different precedences, where `ex1` gives precedence to the first operator over the second and third, `ex2` gives precedence to the second operator over the first and third, and `ex3` gives precedence to the third operator over the first and second.

The `factor`, `factor12`, `factor21`, and `factor1` methods handle the parsing of numbers and subexpressions within parentheses, which are not present in this input.

The `number` method parses a number from the current position of `now` until a non-digit character is encountered.

The `cal` method performs the actual calculation based on the operator provided.

After all possible calculations are made, the maximum result is printed.

For the input "3-2*3", the following calculations will be made:
- With equal precedence: (3-2)*3 = 3
- With precedence of '+' over '-' and '*': 3-(2*3) = -3
- With precedence of '-' over '*' and '+': (3-2)*3 = 3
- With precedence of '*' over '+' and '-': 3-(2*3) = -3
- With precedence of '+' over '*' and '-': 3-(2*3) = -3
- With precedence of '-' over '+' and '*': (3-2)*3 = 3
- With precedence of '*' over '-' and '+': 3-(2*3) = -3

The maximum of all these results is 3, which will be the final output.
