<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3 3 2 2`, which initializes the variables r, c, h, and w with the values 3, 3, 2, and 2 respectively.

The first if condition checks if both r % h and c % w are equal to 0. Since r % h is 3 % 2, which equals 1, and c % w is 3 % 2, which also equals 1, the condition is false. Therefore, the program does not print "No" and continues execution.

The variable mcnt is calculated as (r / h) * (c / w), which is (3 / 2) * (3 / 2), resulting in 1 * 1 = 1.

The variable space is calculated as r * c - ((r / h) * h) * ((c / w) * w), which is 3 * 3 - ((3 / 2) * 2) * ((3 / 2) * 2), resulting in 9 - (1 * 2) * (1 * 2), which simplifies to 9 - 4 = 5.

The variable plusNumber is calculated as ((mcnt + space) / space) + 1, which is ((1 + 5) / 5) + 1, resulting in (6 / 5) + 1, which simplifies to 1 + 1 = 2.

The variable minusNumber is calculated as -(plusNumber * (h * w - 1) + 1), which is -(2 * (2 * 2 - 1) + 1), resulting in -(2 * (4 - 1) + 1), which simplifies to -(2 * 3 + 1), which is -7.

The program then prints "Yes" and enters a nested for loop to print a 3x3 matrix. The condition inside the loop checks if both (i+1) % h and (j+1) % w are equal to 0. If true, it prints minusNumber; otherwise, it prints plusNumber.

For the given input, the condition is true only when i = 1 and j = 1 (since the indices are 0-based), so minusNumber is printed at position (2, 2) of the matrix. All other positions will have plusNumber.

The output matrix will be:
2 2 2
2 -7 2
2 2 2

<<<Output>>>
Yes
2 2 2
2 -7 2
2 2 2
