<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads an integer value into the variable n. The input provided is `3`, so n is set to 3.

The code then checks if n is an even number by using the modulo operator (n % 2). If n is even (which means n % 2 equals 0), it will print the value of n. If n is not even (which means n % 2 does not equal 0), it will print the value of n multiplied by 2.

Since 3 is not an even number (3 % 2 equals 1), the else block is executed, and the code prints the value of n multiplied by 2, which is 3 * 2 = 6.

<<<Output>>>
6
