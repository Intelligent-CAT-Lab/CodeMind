<<<Analysis>>>
The input "3-2*3" is read and split into tokens: "3", "-", "2", "*", "3". These tokens are then converted into elements (Elm) and added to the `expr` list. The elements are instances of `Num` for numbers and instances of `Add`, `Subtract`, and `Multiply` for the operators.

The `postfix` method is called with the `expr` list and each of the priority configurations from the `PRI` array. This method converts the infix expression to postfix notation based on the given priority configuration. The `eval` method is then called with the postfix expression to evaluate it and return the result.

The `eval` method uses a stack to evaluate the postfix expression. When an operator is encountered, it pops two numbers from the stack, applies the operation, and pushes the result back onto the stack.

The `main` method iterates over all priority configurations, evaluates the expression for each, and keeps track of the maximum result in the `max` variable.

For the input "3-2*3", the expression can be evaluated in different ways depending on the operator precedence. The possible evaluations are:
1. (3-2)*3 = 3
2. 3-(2*3) = -3

The maximum value obtained from these evaluations is 3, which will be the output of the program.
