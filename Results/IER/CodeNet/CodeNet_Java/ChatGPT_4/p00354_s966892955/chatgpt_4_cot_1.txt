<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `solve` method that takes an input `n` and prints out a string representing a day of the week based on the remainder of `n` divided by 7. The `FastScanner` class is used for input parsing, and the `PrintWriter` class is used for output.

The `main` method creates instances of `FastScanner` and `PrintWriter`, calls the `solve` method with these instances and an instance of `Methods`, and then closes the scanner and writer.

Given the input `1`, the `solve` method will be called with `n` equal to 1. The method checks the remainder of `n` divided by 7 and prints out the corresponding day of the week. Since `1 % 7` equals `1`, the corresponding day is "fri".

<<<Output>>>
fri
