<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and n are initialized with 5, 7, and 4 respectively according to the input.
The condition in the if statement checks if n is greater than or equal to b. Since n (4) is less than b (7), the condition is false.
Therefore, the else block is executed, which contains the expression a*n/b. This expression is evaluated as follows:
a*n = 5*4 = 20
20/b = 20/7
Since both a and b are of type long, the division is integer division, which means the result is the integer part of the quotient, discarding any remainder.
Thus, 20/7 is 2 (since 20 divided by 7 is 2 with a remainder of 6).
The result of the expression is then printed, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
