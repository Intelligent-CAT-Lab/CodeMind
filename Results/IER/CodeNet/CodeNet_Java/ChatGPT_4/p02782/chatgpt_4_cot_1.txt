The input values are assigned to the static variables R1, C1, R2, and C2 as follows: R1 = 1, C1 = 1, R2 = 2, C2 = 2.

The `solve()` method is called, which calculates the sum of the values in a grid from (R1, C1) to (R2, C2) using a combinatorial approach.

First, an array `factorial` is created to store the factorial values up to R2+C2+10. The factorial values are calculated iteratively and stored in the array.

Next, the method `f` is called four times with different parameters to calculate the sum of values in the grid using the combinatorial formula `k(r+1, c+1) - 1`, where `k` is the combinatorial function. The results of these calls are stored in variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

The final result is calculated by adding `a` to `d` and subtracting `b` and `c` from the sum. The `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and `div` methods are used to perform these operations under modulo arithmetic with a modulus of 1_000_000_007.

The `f` method calculates the value for a single cell in the grid using the factorial array and modular arithmetic.

The `pow`, `sub`, `div`, `add`, and `mul` methods are helper methods to perform modular exponentiation, subtraction, division, addition, and multiplication, respectively.

Given the input `1 1 2 2`, the `solve()` method will calculate the sum of values in the grid from (1, 1) to (2, 2). The factorial array will be calculated up to index 14 (since R2+C2+10 = 2+2+10 = 14).

The values returned by the `f` method will be:
- `a` = f(2, 2, factorial) = k(3, 3) - 1
- `b` = f(2, 0, factorial) = k(3, 1) - 1
- `c` = f(0, 2, factorial) = k(1, 3) - 1
- `d` = f(0, 0, factorial) = k(1, 1) - 1

The final result is calculated as `a - b - c + d` under modulo arithmetic.

Let's calculate the values step by step:
- factorial[0] = 1
- factorial[1] = 1
- factorial[2] = 2
- factorial[3] = 6
- factorial[4] = 24
- factorial[5] = 120
- ...
- factorial[14] = 87178291200 % 1_000_000_007 = 1307674368000 % 1_000_000_007 = 227020758

Now, we calculate the values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using the factorial array and the `f` method:
- `a` = f(2, 2, factorial) = factorial[5] / (factorial[3] * factorial[3]) - 1 = 120 / (6 * 6) - 1 = 120 / 36 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2
- `b` = f(2, 0, factorial) = factorial[3] / (factorial[3] * factorial[1]) - 1 = 6 / (6 * 1) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0
- `c` = f(0, 2, factorial) = factorial[3] / (factorial[1] * factorial[3]) - 1 = 6 / (1 * 6) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0
- `d` = f(0, 0, factorial) = factorial[1] / (factorial[1] * factorial[1]) - 1 = 1 / (1 * 1) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0

The final result is `a - b - c + d` = 2 - 0 - 0 + 0 = 2.

Therefore, the output of the code execution given the input `1 1 2 2` is 2.
