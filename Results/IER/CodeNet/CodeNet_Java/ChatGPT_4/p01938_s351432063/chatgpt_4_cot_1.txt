The input string "AIZU" is read and stored in the variable `ins`. The length of the string is calculated and stored in the variable `length`, which is 4 in this case.

The variable `pre_char` is initialized with the ASCII value of 'A', which is 65. The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0.

The for loop iterates over each character of the string "AIZU".

1. In the first iteration, `i=0`, the character at index 0 is 'A'. The ASCII value of 'A' is 65. Since `c` (65) is not greater than `pre_char` (65), the else branch is executed. The calculation is `(65 - 65) + 26 = 26`. `cnt` becomes 26, and `pre_char` is updated to 65.

2. In the second iteration, `i=1`, the character at index 1 is 'I'. The ASCII value of 'I' is 73. Since `c` (73) is greater than `pre_char` (65), the if branch is executed. The calculation is `73 - 65 = 8`. `cnt` becomes 26 + 8 = 34, and `pre_char` is updated to 73.

3. In the third iteration, `i=2`, the character at index 2 is 'Z'. The ASCII value of 'Z' is 90. Since `c` (90) is greater than `pre_char` (73), the if branch is executed. The calculation is `90 - 73 = 17`. `cnt` becomes 34 + 17 = 51, and `pre_char` is updated to 90.

4. In the fourth iteration, `i=3`, the character at index 3 is 'U'. The ASCII value of 'U' is 85. Since `c` (85) is not greater than `pre_char` (90), the else branch is executed. The calculation is `(85 - 90) + 26 = 21`. `cnt` becomes 51 + 21 = 72, and `pre_char` is updated to 85.

After the loop, the final value of `cnt` is 72. The program then prints the result of `cnt / 26`, which is `72 / 26 = 2` (since it's integer division, the fractional part is discarded).
