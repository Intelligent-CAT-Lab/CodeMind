<<<Analysis>>>
The input "1118" is read and stored in the variable `input`.
The `input` is then split into an array of strings `valueset` where each element contains a single character from the input. The `valueset` array will contain ["1", "1", "1", "8"].
The if condition checks two things:
1. Whether the second and third characters are equal (`valueset[1].equals(valueset[2])`), which is true since both are "1".
2. Whether the first character is equal to the second or the second character is equal to the fourth (`valueset[0].equals(valueset[1]) || valueset[1].equals(valueset[3])`). The first part of this condition is true since "1" equals "1", and the second part is false since "1" does not equal "8".

Since the first condition is true and the first part of the second condition is true, the overall condition is true, and "Yes" will be printed.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
