<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "abca". The code first counts the frequency of each alphabet in the string and stores it in the alphabets array. The frequencies are as follows:
- 'a': 2
- 'b': 1
- 'c': 1

A PriorityQueue of Node objects is created, which will order the nodes by their frequency in ascending order. Nodes are added to the PriorityQueue for each alphabet with a non-zero frequency. The nodes added will be:
- Node(freq=2, c='a')
- Node(freq=1, c='b')
- Node(freq=1, c='c')

Since the PriorityQueue size is greater than 1, the code enters the while loop to construct a Huffman tree. In each iteration, it removes two nodes with the smallest frequencies, creates a new node with these two nodes as children, and inserts the new node back into the PriorityQueue. The steps are as follows:
1. Remove 'b' and 'c' (both with frequency 1), create a new node 'X' with frequency 2, and add it back to the PriorityQueue.
2. Remove 'a' (frequency 2) and 'X' (frequency 2), create a new node 'X' with frequency 4, and add it back to the PriorityQueue.

Now the PriorityQueue has only one node left, which is the root of the Huffman tree with frequency 4. The DFS function is called to calculate the length of the encoding for each character based on the Huffman tree. The lengths are:
- 'a': 1 (since 'a' is directly under the root)
- 'b': 2 (since 'b' is two levels below the root)
- 'c': 2 (since 'c' is two levels below the root)

Finally, the code calculates the result by multiplying the frequency of each character by its length and summing them up:
- result = (2 * 1) + (1 * 2) + (1 * 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6

The output is the total length of the encoded string using the Huffman tree, which is 6.
