<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two variables n and m with the values 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It then calculates the number of combinations that can be made with n items, which is given by the formula n * (n-1) / 2. For n = 2, this results in 2 * (2-1) / 2 = 1.
Similarly, it calculates the number of combinations that can be made with m items, which is given by the formula m * (m-1) / 2. For m = 1, this results in 1 * (1-1) / 2 = 0.
Finally, it adds the two results together to get the total number of combinations, which is 1 + 0 = 1.
The code then prints this result.
