<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is `<>>`. The variable `n` is initialized with the length of the input string, which is 3. The variable `ans` is initialized with 0, which will hold the final answer. The variable `c` is initialized with the first character of the input string, which is `<`. The variables `up` and `down` are initialized with 0, which will count the consecutive `<` and `>` characters respectively.

The program enters a for loop and iterates over each character of the input string.

1. For `i = 0`, `S[i]` is `<`. Since `S[i]` is equal to `c`, `up` is incremented to 1. `down` remains 0.
2. For `i = 1`, `S[i]` is `>`. Since `S[i]` is not equal to `c`, the program calculates `ans` by adding `Math.max(up, down) + up * (up - 1) / 2 + down * (down - 1) / 2`, which is `Math.max(1, 0) + 1 * (1 - 1) / 2 + 0 * (0 - 1) / 2`, resulting in `ans` being 1. `up` is set to 0, and `down` is incremented to 1.
3. For `i = 2`, `S[i]` is `>`. Since `S[i]` is equal to `c`, `down` is incremented to 2.

After the loop, the program calculates `ans` one last time by adding `Math.max(up, down) + up * (up - 1) / 2 + down * (down - 1) / 2`, which is `Math.max(0, 2) + 0 * (0 - 1) / 2 + 2 * (2 - 1) / 2`, resulting in `ans` being 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

Finally, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is 4.
