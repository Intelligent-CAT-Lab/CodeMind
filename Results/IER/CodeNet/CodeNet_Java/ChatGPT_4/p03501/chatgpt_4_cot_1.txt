<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `main` method that takes input and prints the minimum of two values: `A*N` and `B`. The `FastScanner` class is used to read input from the standard input stream.

The input `7 17 120` initializes the variables `N`, `A`, and `B` with the values 7, 17, and 120, respectively.

The expression `A*N` calculates to `17*7`, which is 119. The code then compares this value with `B`, which is 120.

The `Math.min` function is used to determine the smaller of the two values, which in this case is 119 since it is less than 120.

The result of `Math.min(A*N,B)` is then printed to the standard output.

Therefore, the output will be the minimum of 119 and 120, which is 119.
