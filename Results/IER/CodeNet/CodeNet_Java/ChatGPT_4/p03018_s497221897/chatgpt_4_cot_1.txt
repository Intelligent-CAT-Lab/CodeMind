<<<Analysis>>>
The input string s is initialized with "ABCABC". The variables acnt and sum are initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates over each character of the string "ABCABC".

1. i = 0, c = 'A', acnt is incremented to 1.
2. i = 1, c = 'B', and the next character is 'C', so sum is incremented by acnt (sum = 1), and i is incremented to 2.
3. i = 2, c = 'C', acnt is not modified.
4. i = 3, c = 'A', acnt is incremented to 2 (since it was not reset after 'C').
5. i = 4, c = 'B', and the next character is 'C', so sum is incremented by acnt (sum = 1 + 2 = 3), and i is incremented to 5.
6. i = 5, c = 'C', acnt is not modified.

The loop ends as all characters have been processed. The final value of sum is 3, which is printed as the output.
