<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input. The input provided is `3 5`, so a is initialized with 3 and b with 5.

The code then checks if a is less than b using an if-else statement. Since 3 is indeed less than 5, the condition (a < b) evaluates to true.

As a result, the code executes the first branch of the if-else statement and prints the number 0 to the standard output.

The else branch, which would print the number 10, is not executed because the condition for the if statement was met.

<<<Output>>>
0
