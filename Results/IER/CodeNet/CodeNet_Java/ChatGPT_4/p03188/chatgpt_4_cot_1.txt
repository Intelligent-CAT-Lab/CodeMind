The input is `2`, which is assigned to the variable `k`. The program then checks if `k` is equal to `1`. Since it is not, the program proceeds to calculate the size `n` of the square matrix. The size `n` is calculated as `(k + 3) / 4 * 2`, which for `k = 2` results in `n = (2 + 3) / 4 * 2 = 2`.

A square matrix `ret` of size `n x n` (2x2) is created and initialized with values according to the nested for loops. The first for loop fills the matrix with values based on the condition `(i % 2 == 0 ? 0 : n) + (i + j) % n`. For `n = 2`, the matrix is filled as follows:

- `ret[0][0] = (0 % 2 == 0 ? 0 : 2) + (0 + 0) % 2 = 0 + 0 = 0`
- `ret[0][1] = (0 % 2 == 0 ? 0 : 2) + (0 + 1) % 2 = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `ret[1][0] = (1 % 2 == 0 ? 0 : 2) + (1 + 0) % 2 = 2 + 1 = 3`
- `ret[1][1] = (1 % 2 == 0 ? 0 : 2) + (1 + 1) % 2 = 2 + 0 = 2`

The second for loop adjusts the values in the matrix such that if any value is greater than or equal to `k`, it is replaced with `(value - n) % k`. For `k = 2` and `n = 2`, the adjustments are as follows:

- `ret[1][0] = (3 >= 2) ? (3 - 2) % 2 = 1 % 2 = 1`
- `ret[1][1] = (2 >= 2) ? (2 - 2) % 2 = 0 % 2 = 0`

The final matrix `ret` after adjustments is:
```
0 1
1 0
```

The program then prints the size of the matrix `n` followed by the matrix itself, with each value incremented by `1` to match the problem's 1-indexing requirement. The final output matrix is:
```
1 2
2 1
```
