<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two static variables N and K by reading from the standard input using a Scanner object. The input provided is `3 2`, so N is initialized to 3 and K is initialized to 2.

The main method contains a single if-else statement that checks if N is greater than or equal to K multiplied by 2 minus 1. The expression K*2-1 is evaluated as 2*2-1, which equals 3.

Since N is equal to 3, the condition N >= K*2-1 is true. Therefore, the code within the if block will execute, and "YES" will be printed to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
YES
