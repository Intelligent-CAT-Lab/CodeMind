<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 100 according to the input. The variable result is initialized with 0.

The code then performs a series of division and modulo operations to determine the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount n in a currency system where coins are available in denominations of 25, 10, 5, and 1.

First, it divides n by 25 to find out how many 25-value coins are needed. Since 100 divided by 25 is 4, result becomes 4 and n becomes 100 % 25, which is 0.

Since n is now 0, the subsequent operations (dividing by 10, 5, and adding the remainder) do not change the result or n.

Finally, it prints the value of result + n, which is 4 + 0.

The gcd and lcm functions are not used in this code.

<<<Output>>>
4
