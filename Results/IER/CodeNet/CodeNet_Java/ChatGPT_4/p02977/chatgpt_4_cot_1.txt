The input is `3`. The main method sets the `autoFlush` field of `System.out` to `false` and then calls the `execute` method with `System.in` and `System.out` as arguments.

The `execute` method creates an `ExtendedScanner` object `s` and an `Out` object `o`, then calls the `solve` method with these objects.

In the `solve` method, the `nextInt` method of `ExtendedScanner` is called, which reads the input `3` and assigns it to the variable `n`.

The first `if` statement checks if `n` is a power of 2 by using bitwise AND with its negation (`(n & -n) == n`). Since `3` is not a power of 2, this condition is false, and the method proceeds to print "Yes" using the `writeln` method of the `Out` class.

The next `if` statement checks if `n` is equal to `3`. Since it is, the method prints the following lines using the `writeln` method:
```
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
After printing these lines, the `solve` method returns, and the `execute` method calls `flush` and `close` on the `Out` object `o` to ensure all output is written and the stream is closed.

The output is the string "Yes" followed by the five lines of numbers as shown above.
