<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input, which are 1 and 3, and assigns them to variables a and b, respectively.
It then calculates the average of these two numbers by adding them together and dividing by 2.0 to ensure floating-point division. The result of (a + b) / 2.0 is 2.0.
The Math.ceil function is used to round up the result to the nearest integer. Since the result is already an integer (2.0), Math.ceil will not change the value.
Finally, the result is cast to an int and printed out, which will be 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
