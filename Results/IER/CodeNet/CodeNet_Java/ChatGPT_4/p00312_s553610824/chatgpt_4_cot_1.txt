<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two integer variables D and L with the values 10 and 5 respectively according to the input. It then calculates the number of full jumps that can be made by dividing D by L, which is 10 / 5 = 2. This result is stored in the variable jump_time_L.

The code then calculates the total jump time by adding the number of full jumps (jump_time_L) to the remaining distance that needs to be covered after making the full jumps. The remaining distance is calculated by subtracting the total distance covered by full jumps (L * jump_time_L) from D, which is 10 - (5 * 2) = 0.

Therefore, the total jump time (jump_time) is the sum of jump_time_L and the remaining distance, which is 2 + 0 = 2.

Finally, the code prints out the value of jump_time.
