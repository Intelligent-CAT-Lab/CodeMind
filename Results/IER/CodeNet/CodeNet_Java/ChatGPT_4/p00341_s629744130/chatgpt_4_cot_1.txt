<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an integer array `t` with a size of 12. It then reads 12 integers from the input and stores them in the array `t`. The input provided is `1 1 3 4 8 9 7 3 4 5 5 5`.

Next, the code performs a bubble sort on the array `t` in descending order. After the sorting process, the array `t` will be `9 8 7 5 5 5 4 4 3 3 1 1`.

After sorting, the code checks if the first four elements are equal, the next four elements are equal, and the last four elements are equal. In this case, the first four elements `9 8 7 5` are not equal, so the condition for the `if` statement is not met.

Therefore, the output will be "no" because the condition for printing "yes" is not satisfied.

<<<Output>>>
no
