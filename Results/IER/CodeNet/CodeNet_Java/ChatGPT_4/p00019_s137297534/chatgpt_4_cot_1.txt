<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate the factorial of a given number. The `parseNum` method reads a line from the standard input and tries to parse it into an integer, which is then returned and stored in the variable `nNum`.

Given the input `5`, the `parseNum` method will read this input and parse it into the integer 5, which is then assigned to `nNum`.

The `main` method initializes `nFact` to 1, which is the starting value for the factorial calculation. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to `nNum` (inclusive), multiplying `nFact` by the loop index `n` at each step.

The loop will execute with `n` taking the values 2, 3, 4, and 5. The variable `nFact` will be updated as follows:
- When `n` is 2, `nFact` becomes 1 * 2 = 2.
- When `n` is 3, `nFact` becomes 2 * 3 = 6.
- When `n` is 4, `nFact` becomes 6 * 4 = 24.
- When `n` is 5, `nFact` becomes 24 * 5 = 120.

After the loop finishes, the final value of `nFact` is 120, which is the factorial of 5. The program then prints this value to the standard output.
