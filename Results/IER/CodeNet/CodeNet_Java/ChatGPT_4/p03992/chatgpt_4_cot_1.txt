<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "CODEFESTIVAL" is read and stored in the variable X. The program then enters a for loop that iterates over each character of the input string.

The loop runs from index 0 to the length of the string X, which is 12 in this case. Inside the loop, there is a condition that checks if the current index i is equal to 4. If it is, the program appends a space followed by the character at index 4 to the StringBuilder object sb. Otherwise, it simply appends the current character to sb.

The characters at indices 0, 1, 2, 3 are appended to sb without any space. When i reaches 4, a space is appended followed by the character at index 4, which is 'F'. The loop continues appending the rest of the characters from indices 5 to 11 to sb.

After the loop, the StringBuilder object sb contains the string "CODE FESTIVAL". This string is then printed to the output using PrintWriter, and the PrintWriter is closed.
