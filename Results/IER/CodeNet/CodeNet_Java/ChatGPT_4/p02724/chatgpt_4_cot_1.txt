<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 1024 according to the input.
The variable gohyaku is calculated by dividing X by 500, which results in 2 (since 1024 / 500 = 2).
X is then updated by subtracting 500 multiplied by gohyaku, which is 1000 (500 * 2). So, X becomes 1024 - 1000 = 24.
The variable goen is calculated by dividing the updated X by 5, which results in 4 (since 24 / 5 = 4).
Finally, the program prints the result of (1000 * gohyaku) + (5 * goen), which is (1000 * 2) + (5 * 4) = 2000 + 20 = 2020.
<<<Output>>>
2020
