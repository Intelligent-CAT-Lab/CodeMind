<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "010" is converted to a character array `c` with length `n` equal to 3. The variable `ret` is initialized to 0, which will hold the final result.

The outer for loop runs twice, once for `i = 0` and once for `i = 1`. This is to calculate the maximum length of a block of '0's and '1's separately.

For `i = 0`:
- `now` is initialized to 0.
- `x` and `y` are initialized to a very large number (1e9).
- An infinite loop starts to find the length of consecutive '0's and the distance from the start or end to the nearest '0'.
- The inner while loop increments `now` until a '0' is found or the end of the array is reached.
- `p` is set to the current value of `now`.
- The next inner while loop increments `now` while the current character is '0'.
- `x` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the length of consecutive '0's found (`now - p`).
- `y` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `p` and the distance from the end of the array to the current position (`n - now`).
- If `now` is greater than or equal to `n`, the infinite loop breaks.
- `ret` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the maximum of `x` and `y`.

For `i = 0`, the sequence of '0's is "0" and the sequence of '1's is "1". The maximum length of a block of '0's is 1, and the distance from the start or end to the nearest '0' is also 1. Therefore, `ret` is updated to 1.

For `i = 1`:
- The same process is repeated for '1's.
- For the input "010", there is only one '1', so the maximum length of a block of '1's is 1, and the distance from the start or end to the nearest '1' is 1.
- `ret` remains 1 as it is the maximum value found.

Finally, the value of `ret` is printed, which is 1.
