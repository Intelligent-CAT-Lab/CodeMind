<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three values from the input and assigns them to the variables d, t, and s. The input values are 1000, 15, and 80, respectively. The variable d is read as an integer and then implicitly cast to a double, t is read as a double, and s is read as an integer and then implicitly cast to a double.

The variable kakaruhun is calculated using the formula Math.ceil(d/s), which represents the ceiling of the division of d by s. This is the minimum number of hours needed to cover the distance d at speed s. The calculation is Math.ceil(1000/80), which results in Math.ceil(12.5), and since Math.ceil rounds up to the nearest whole number, kakaruhun becomes 13.

The if statement checks if kakaruhun is less than or equal to t. Since kakaruhun is 13 and t is 15, the condition is true.

Because the condition is true, the program prints "Yes" to indicate that it is possible to reach the destination within the time limit t.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
