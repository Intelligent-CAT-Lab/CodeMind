<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 2` initializes `n` with 2 and `k` with 2. The `mod` variable is set to 1,000,000,007 (1e9 + 7).

The 2D array `dp` is created with dimensions [3][22] (since `n + 1` is 3 and `n * n + 10` is 14 + 10 = 24, but for simplicity, we'll assume it's 22 as the code does not rely on the exact size beyond `n * n`).

The value of `dp[2][0]` is set to 1, indicating there is one way to have a sum of 0 at position 2.

The nested loops iterate over the positions from `n - 1` to 0 (i.e., from 1 to 0) and over the possible sums that can be increased (`add`).

For each position `i` and each possible sum `add`, the algorithm calculates the number of ways to reach this sum with an additional number `j` from 0 to `k` (inclusive). If `j` is less than or equal to `i + 1`, it calculates the new sum `nadd` by distributing `j + add` over the positions.

The result `res` is initially calculated as the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (k * (k + 1) / 2), which is 2 * (2 + 1) / 2 = 3.

Then, `res` is multiplied by `k + 1` for each position except the last one, and taken modulo `mod`. Since `n` is 2, this happens once, so `res` becomes 3 * (2 + 1) = 9.

`res` is then multiplied by `n` and taken modulo `mod`, so `res` becomes 9 * 2 = 18.

Finally, the algorithm subtracts the product of each `sub` and `dp[0][sub]` from `res`, modulo `mod`. The `dp` array is filled in such a way that `dp[0][1]` is 4, `dp[0][2]` is 2, and all other `dp[0][sub]` are 0.

So, `res` is updated as follows:
- `res` = 18 - 1 * 4 % mod = 14 (since 18 - 4 = 14)
- `res` = 14 - 2 * 2 % mod = 10 (since 14 - 4 = 10)

Since there are no more non-zero `dp[0][sub]` values, the final result is 10.

The result is printed to the output.
