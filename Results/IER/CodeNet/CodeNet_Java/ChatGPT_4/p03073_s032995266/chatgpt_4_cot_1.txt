The input string str1 is initialized with "000". The variables intCnt1 and intCnt2 are initialized with 0. The boolean variable bIsWhite is initialized with true.

The for loop iterates over each character of the input string "000". The loop runs three times because the length of the string is 3.

During the first iteration (i=0), the character at index 0 is '0'. Since bIsWhite is true, the condition checks if '0' is equal to '0' (which is true), so intCnt1 is incremented by 1. Then bIsWhite is toggled to false.

During the second iteration (i=1), the character at index 1 is '0'. Now bIsWhite is false, so the condition checks if '0' is equal to '1' (which is false), so intCnt2 is incremented by 1. Then bIsWhite is toggled to true.

During the third iteration (i=2), the character at index 2 is '0'. Now bIsWhite is true again, so the condition checks if '0' is equal to '0' (which is true), so intCnt1 is incremented by 1. Then bIsWhite is toggled to false.

After the loop, intCnt1 is 2 and intCnt2 is 1. The ternary operator checks if intCnt1 < intCnt2, which is false, so it returns intCnt2.

The output is the value of intCnt2, which is 1.
