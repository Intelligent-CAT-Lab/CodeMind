<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `aba` is read and stored in the variable `s`. The program then checks the first and last characters of the string `s`.

Since the first character `a` is equal to the last character `a`, the program enters the first condition. Inside this condition, it checks the length of the string `s`, which is 3.

Because the length of the string `s` is odd (3 % 2 == 1), the program prints "Second" as per the condition inside the if statement.

<<<Output>>>
Second
