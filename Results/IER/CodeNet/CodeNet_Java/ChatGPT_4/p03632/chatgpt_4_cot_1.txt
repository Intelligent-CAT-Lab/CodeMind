<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of integers. The input `0 75 25 100` is split into four integers: a=0, b=75, c=25, and d=100.

The code then calculates the maximum of a and c, which is the start of the overlapping range. In this case, start = max(0, 25) = 25.

Next, it calculates the minimum of b and d, which is the end of the overlapping range. In this case, end = min(75, 100) = 75.

The code then calculates the length of the overlapping range by subtracting start from end: end - start = 75 - 25 = 50.

If the result is greater than 0, it prints the result; otherwise, it prints 0. Since 50 is greater than 0, the code will print 50.

<<<Output>>>
50
