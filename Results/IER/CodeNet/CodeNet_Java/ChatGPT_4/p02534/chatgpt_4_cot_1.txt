<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class Main with a main method that creates an instance of Main using a Scanner object to read input from the standard input. The input is an integer K.

The Main constructor takes the Scanner object and reads the integer K from the input. In this case, K is set to 3.

The solve method is called on the Main object. Inside the solve method, a for loop runs K times (3 times in this case). Each iteration of the loop appends the string "ACL" to the answer string.

After the loop, the answer string contains "ACL" repeated K times. Since K is 3, the answer string will be "ACLACLACL".

The show method is then called with the answer string, which prints the answer to the standard output.
