<<<Analysis>>>
The main method creates an instance of the Main class and calls the solveG() method. The solveG() method is the only one that will be executed based on the given code structure.

The solveG() method reads three integers from the input: X, A, and B, which are 4, 3, and 6 respectively.

The method then checks the following conditions:
1. If A is greater than or equal to B, it prints "delicious".
2. Else if the sum of X and A is less than B, it prints "dangerous".
3. Otherwise, it prints "safe".

In this case, since A (3) is not greater than B (6), the first condition is false. The second condition checks if X (4) + A (3) is less than B (6), which is also false because 4 + 3 = 7, which is not less than 6. Therefore, the method prints "safe" as the output.
