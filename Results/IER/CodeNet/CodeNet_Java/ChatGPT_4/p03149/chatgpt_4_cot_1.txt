<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array N of size 4 and then enters a loop to fill this array with integers from the input. The input provided is `1 7 9 4`, so after the loop, the array N contains these numbers in the same order: [1, 7, 9, 4].

Next, the code sorts the array N in ascending order. After sorting, the array N will be [1, 4, 7, 9].

The code then initializes a boolean variable ans with false. It checks if the sorted array N has the specific sequence of numbers [1, 4, 7, 9]. Since the sorted array matches this sequence, the variable ans is set to true.

Finally, the code checks the value of ans. If ans is true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". Since ans is true in this case, the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
