<<<Analysis>>>
The Scanner object is created to read input from the standard input. The variables X, A, and B are initialized with the values 4, 3, and 6 respectively according to the input.

The if-else statement checks the following conditions in order:
1. If B is less than or equal to A, it prints "delicious".
2. Else, if the difference between B and A is less than or equal to X, it prints "safe".
3. Otherwise, it prints "dangerous".

In this case, B (6) is not less than or equal to A (3), so the first condition is false. The difference between B and A is 3 (6 - 3 = 3), which is less than or equal to X (4). Therefore, the second condition is true.

Since the second condition is true, the program prints "safe" and does not check the third condition.

<<<Output>>>
safe
