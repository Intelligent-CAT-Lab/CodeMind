<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to read two integers from the input, add the first integer to half of the second integer, and print the result. However, there is a problem with the Scanner class provided in the code. The Scanner class is not the standard java.util.Scanner class from the Java API, but a custom implementation that is incomplete and will not function correctly because it lacks the necessary code to actually read from the input stream.

The custom Scanner class has methods like hasNextByte(), readByte(), isPrintableChar(), hasNext(), next(), nextLong(), nextInt(), and nextDouble(), but these methods are not implemented correctly to read from the input stream. Specifically, the readByte() method is supposed to read the next byte of data from the input stream, but it does not handle the case where the end of the stream is reached correctly. The hasNext() method is supposed to check if there is another token available, but it does not advance the pointer correctly. The next(), nextLong(), nextInt(), and nextDouble() methods are supposed to read the next token, long, int, and double from the input stream, but they will not work because the underlying readByte() and hasNextByte() methods are not implemented correctly.

Given these issues, the code will throw a NoSuchElementException when the nextInt() method is called because the hasNext() method will always return false due to the incorrect implementation of the hasNextByte() method.

Therefore, the code will not execute successfully to produce an output based on the given input `81 58`. Instead, it will throw an exception when attempting to read the input.
