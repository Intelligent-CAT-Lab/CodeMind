<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `main` method and a class `hayami` that implements `Closeable` and is used for input handling. The `hayami` class has methods to read different types of data from the input stream.

In the `main` method, an instance of `hayami` is created, and the `nextHayami` method is called to read a string from the input. The input string "117" is split into an array of single-character strings `["1", "1", "7"]`.

A for loop iterates over the first three characters of the array. It checks if any of the characters is "7". If a "7" is found, the boolean variable `flg` is set to true.

After the loop, there is a conditional statement that checks the value of `flg`. If `flg` is true, which it is because "7" is present in the input, the program prints "Yes". If `flg` were false, it would print "No".

Finally, the `close` method of the `hayami` instance is called to close the input stream.

Since the input "117" contains the character "7", the output will be "Yes".
