<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, A and B, from the input.

The input provided is `3 1`, so A is assigned the value 3 and B is assigned the value 1.

The code then checks if either A or B is even by using the modulo operator (%). If either A or B is even (i.e., A%2 == 0 or B%2 == 0), it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

Since both 3 and 1 are odd numbers (3%2 is 1 and 1%2 is 1), neither A nor B is even. Therefore, the condition (A%2 == 0)||(B%2 == 0) evaluates to false.

As a result, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
