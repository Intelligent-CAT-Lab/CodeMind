<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input.

The input provided is `8 6`, so a is initialized with 8 and b with 6.

The code then enters a series of conditional checks:
1. It first checks if a is equal to 1 and b is not equal to 1. This condition is false because a is not equal to 1.
2. It then checks if b is equal to 1 and a is not equal to 1. This condition is also false because b is not equal to 1.
3. Next, it checks if a is greater than b, and both a and b are not equal to 1. This condition is true because a (8) is greater than b (6) and neither a nor b is equal to 1.
4. Since the third condition is true, it prints "Alice" and does not check the remaining conditions.
5. The condition to check if a is less than b is not evaluated because the previous condition was true and the code already printed a result.
6. The condition to check if a is equal to b is also not evaluated for the same reason.

Therefore, the output will be "Alice" because a is greater than b and neither a nor b is equal to 1.

Alice
