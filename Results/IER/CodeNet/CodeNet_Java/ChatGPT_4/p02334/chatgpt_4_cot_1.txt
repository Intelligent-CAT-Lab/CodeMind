The input `5 3` initializes the variables `n` and `k` with the values 5 and 3, respectively. The `Combinatrics` class is then instantiated with `n+k-1`, which is `5+3-1 = 7`.

The constructor of `Combinatrics` initializes the `fact`, `inv`, and `finv` arrays with sizes up to `n+1`, which in this case is `7+1 = 8`. It then calculates the factorial, inverse, and factorial inverse for all numbers from 0 to 7.

The `homogeneous` method is called with parameters `k` and `n`, which are `3` and `5`, respectively. This method calculates the combination of `n+r-1` choose `r`, which is `7` choose `3` in this case.

The combination method calculates `fact[n] * finv[r] % mod * finv[n-r] % mod`, which is `fact[7] * finv[3] % mod * finv[4] % mod`. The factorial of 7 is calculated during the constructor initialization, as well as the factorial inverses of 3 and 4.

The factorial of 7 is `5040`, the factorial inverse of 3 is `inv[3]` which is calculated as `mod - inv[mod%3] * (mod / 3) % mod`, and the factorial inverse of 4 is `inv[4]` which is calculated similarly.

The final calculation is `5040 * inv[3] % mod * inv[4] % mod`. The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the range of the defined `mod`, which is `1000000007`.

The result of this calculation is the output of the program.
