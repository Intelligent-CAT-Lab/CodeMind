<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads an integer value into the variable i. The variable ans is initialized with the value 1. The code checks if the value of i is equal to 1. Since the input provided is `1`, the condition i == 1 is true. Therefore, the value of ans is set to 0. Finally, the value of ans is printed to the console, which is 0.
