<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then calls the `gs()` method to read a string `s` from the input, which in this case is "oxo".

The main part of the code calculates the output by first determining the number of 'o' characters in the string `s`. It does this by subtracting the length of the string after removing all 'o' characters from the original length of the string. The result is the count of 'o' characters in the string.

For the input "oxo", the length of the string is 3. After replacing 'o' with an empty string, the length becomes 1 (since "oxo" becomes "x" after replacement). Therefore, the count of 'o' characters is 3 - 1 = 2.

The code then multiplies this count by 100 and adds 700 to it. So the calculation is (2 * 100) + 700 = 200 + 700 = 900.

Finally, the code prints the result of this calculation, which is 900.
