<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two integers, n and k, which are 7 and 3 respectively according to the input provided.

The code checks if n is divisible by k without any remainder using the modulo operator (%). If n is divisible by k (meaning n % k equals 0), it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1.

In this case, 7 is not divisible by 3 (7 % 3 equals 1), so the condition (n % k == 0) is false.

Therefore, the else block will be executed, and the code will print 1.
