<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "+-++". The Scanner object reads this string and assigns it to the variable s. The toCharArray() method is called on the string s, which converts the string into a character array ch[] with the characters ['+', '-', '+', '+'].

The variable x is initialized to 0. A for loop is used to iterate over each character in the character array ch[]. The loop runs for the length of the string s, which is 4 in this case.

The loop checks each character:
- For the first character '+', x is incremented by 1, so x becomes 1.
- For the second character '-', x is decremented by 1, so x becomes 0.
- For the third character '+', x is incremented by 1, so x becomes 1.
- For the fourth character '+', x is incremented by 1, so x becomes 2.

After the loop finishes, the final value of x is 2, which is printed to the console.
