<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `1 3 3`, which initializes the variables n, d, and x with 1, 3, and 3 respectively.

Two arrays, F and G, are created with a size of 200001 elements each. Both arrays are filled with -1 initially.

The value of F[1] is set to 0.5 and G[1] is set to 1.

A for loop is set to iterate from 2 to 200000, but since n is 1, the loop is not executed.

The final output is calculated using the formula `F[n] * x + d * G[n]`. Since n is 1, the formula becomes `F[1] * x + d * G[1]`, which is `0.5 * 3 + 3 * 1`. This simplifies to `1.5 + 3`, resulting in `4.5`.

The output is printed with a format of 20 decimal places, so the result will be `4.50000000000000000000`.
