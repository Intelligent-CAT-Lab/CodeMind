<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads the first input as a string and creates a BigInteger object named A with the value of the input string. The second input is read as a string and a BigInteger object named B is created with the value of the second input string.

The BigInteger objects A and B are then multiplied using the multiply method of the BigInteger class. The result of the multiplication is printed to the standard output.

Given the input `5 8`, the BigInteger A is initialized with the value 5 and the BigInteger B is initialized with the value 8. The multiplication of A and B (5 * 8) results in 40.

<<<Output>>>
40
