<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates from 0 to N - 2 (since N is 4, it iterates from 0 to 2). In each iteration, the following operations are performed:

1. First iteration (i = 0):
   - ans = 2 * ((long)(0 / (2 - 1))) + 0 % (2 - 1) + 1
   - ans = 2 * 0 + 0 + 1
   - ans = 1

2. Second iteration (i = 1):
   - ans = 2 * ((long)(1 / (2 - 1))) + 1 % (2 - 1) + 1
   - ans = 2 * 1 + 0 + 1
   - ans = 3

3. Third iteration (i = 2):
   - ans = 2 * ((long)(3 / (2 - 1))) + 3 % (2 - 1) + 1
   - ans = 2 * 3 + 1 + 1
   - ans = 7

After the loop finishes, the final value of ans is 7, which is printed as the output.
