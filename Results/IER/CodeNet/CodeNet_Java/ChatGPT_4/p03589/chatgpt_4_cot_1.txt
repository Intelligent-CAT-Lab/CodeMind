<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to find three positive integers h, n, and w, given a positive integer N, such that the following equation is satisfied:

1/N = 1/h + 1/n + 1/w

The code uses two nested loops to iterate over possible values of h and n, both ranging from 1 to 3500. For each pair of h and n, it checks if the following conditions are met:

1. The denominator (4*h*n - N*n - N*h) is not equal to zero, to avoid division by zero.
2. The result of the division (N*h*n) / (4*h*n - N*n - N*h) is greater than zero, to ensure that w is a positive integer.
3. The result of the division is an integer, which is checked by verifying that the remainder of the division (N*h*n) % (4*h*n - N*n - N*h) is zero.

If all these conditions are satisfied, the code prints the values of h, n, and the calculated w, and then returns to exit the program.

Given the input `2`, the code will find the first set of values h, n, and w that satisfy the equation and print them out.

Let's manually find the values that satisfy the conditions:

For N = 2, the equation becomes:

1/2 = 1/h + 1/n + 1/w

We need to find the first set of h and n that satisfy the conditions. We start with h = 1 and n = 1 and increment h and n in the nested loops.

For h = 1 and n = 1:
The denominator is 4*1*1 - 2*1 - 2*1 = 2, which is not zero.
The result of the division is (2*1*1) / (4*1*1 - 2*1 - 2*1) = 2 / 2 = 1, which is greater than zero and an integer.
However, w = 1 does not satisfy the equation 1/2 = 1/1 + 1/1 + 1/1, so we continue.

We continue this process until we find the first set of h and n that satisfy all conditions. The code will output the first valid set of h, n, and w it finds.
