<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "oxo". The variable `price` is initialized with 700.
The code enters a for loop that iterates over each character of the string `s`.
For each character, it checks if the character is 'o'. If it is, it adds 100 to the `price`.
The string "oxo" has two 'o' characters, at index 0 and index 2.
Therefore, the loop will add 100 to `price` two times.
Initially, `price` is 700, after the first 'o', it becomes 800, and after the second 'o', it becomes 900.
After the loop finishes, the final value of `price` is printed, which is 900.
<<<Output>>>
900
