<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized with 615 according to the input. The variable stack_item is calculated as num divided by 100, which is 615 / 100 = 6. The variable diff is calculated as num minus stack_item times 100, which is 615 - (6 * 100) = 15. The boolean variable pos is initially set to false.

The code then checks if diff is less than or equal to stack_item times 5. In this case, 15 is less than or equal to 6 * 5 (which is 30), so the condition is true. Therefore, pos is set to true.

Since pos is true, the code prints "1".
