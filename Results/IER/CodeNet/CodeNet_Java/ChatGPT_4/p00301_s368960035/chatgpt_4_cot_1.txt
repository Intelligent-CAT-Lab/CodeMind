<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `25`. The variable `w` is initialized with the value 25. The variable `base3` is initialized as an empty string.

The while loop will continue to execute as long as `w` is not equal to 0. Inside the loop, the remainder `r` of `w` divided by 3 is calculated. Based on the value of `r`, different actions are taken:

1. If `r` is 0, "0" is concatenated to the left of `base3`, and `w` is divided by 3.
2. If `r` is 1, "+" is concatenated to the left of `base3`, and `w` is divided by 3.
3. If `r` is 2, "-" is concatenated to the left of `base3`, `w` is divided by 3, and then `w` is incremented by 1.

Let's perform the steps for `w = 25`:
- `w % 3` is 1, so `base3` becomes "+", and `w` becomes `25 / 3` which is 8.
- `w % 3` is 2, so `base3` becomes "-+", and `w` becomes `8 / 3` which is 2, and then `w` is incremented to 3.
- `w % 3` is 0, so `base3` becomes "0-+", and `w` becomes `3 / 3` which is 1.
- `w % 3` is 1, so `base3` becomes "+0-+", and `w` becomes `1 / 3` which is 0, and the loop ends.

The final value of `base3` is "+0-+", which is the ternary representation of the number 25 with the digits 0, +, and - representing 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
