<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to perform some kind of combinatorial calculation involving factorials and modular inverses under a large prime modulus (1000000007). It first precomputes the factorials and their modular inverses for numbers up to 500000.

The `power` function is used to compute the modular inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that a^(p-1) â‰¡ 1 (mod p) for a prime p, and thus a^(p-2) is the modular inverse of a under modulus p.

The input `2 2` sets n and m both to 2.

The variable `ans` is calculated as fact[m] * inv[m-n] % num, which is fact[2] * inv[2-2] % num = fact[2] * inv[0] % num = (2 * 1) % num = 2.

The for loop calculates `anss` by iterating from 1 to n (which is 2 in this case). It performs a series of multiplications and modulus operations involving factorials and inverses, and alternates the sign of the result with the variable `pos`.

For i = 1:
- prod = fact[n] * inv[i] * inv[n-i] * fact[m-i] * inv[m-n] * pos
- prod = fact[2] * inv[1] * inv[1] * fact[1] * inv[0] * 1
- prod = (2 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1) % num
- prod = 2 % num
- anss += prod
- anss = (2 + num) % num
- anss = 2
- pos = -pos (pos becomes -1)

For i = 2:
- prod = fact[n] * inv[i] * inv[n-i] * fact[m-i] * inv[m-n] * pos
- prod = fact[2] * inv[2] * inv[0] * fact[0] * inv[0] * -1
- prod = (2 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * -1) % num
- prod = -2 % num
- prod = num - 2 (since -2 % num is equivalent to num - 2)
- anss += prod
- anss = (2 + num - 2) % num
- anss = num % num
- anss = 0
- pos = -pos (pos becomes 1)

The final calculation for `actualans` is:
- actualans += ans * ans
- actualans %= num
- actualans -= anss * ans
- actualans %= num
- actualans = (actualans + num) % num

Substituting the values:
- actualans += 2 * 2
- actualans %= num
- actualans -= 0 * 2
- actualans %= num
- actualans = (4 + num) % num
- actualans = 4

The final output is printed as 4.
