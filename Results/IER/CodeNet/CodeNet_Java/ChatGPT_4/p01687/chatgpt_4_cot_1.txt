<<<Analysis>>>
The input "AIDUNYAN" is read by the scanner. The length of the input is exactly 8 characters, so the program proceeds to process it.

The program enters a loop that will iterate over the input string, checking every substring of length 8. Since the input string is exactly 8 characters long, this loop will only run once.

The substring "AIDUNYAN" is extracted and stored in the variable `tt`. The `sort` method is then called on the array of characters `t` which contains the characters of `tt`.

The `sort` method sorts the characters in the array `t` in ascending order. After sorting, the array `t` contains the characters "AADINNUY".

The sorted string "AADINNUY" is compared to the string `mstr`, which is also "AADINNUY". Since they are equal, the method `String.replace` is called to replace the substring `tt` ("AIDUNYAN") in `dstr` with the string `nstr` ("AIZUNYAN").

The variable `i` is incremented by 7 to move past the replaced substring.

Finally, the modified string "AIZUNYAN" is printed to the console.

<<<Output>>>
AIZUNYAN
