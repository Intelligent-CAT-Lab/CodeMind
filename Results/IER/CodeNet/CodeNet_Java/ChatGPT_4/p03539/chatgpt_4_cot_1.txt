The input provided is `2 2`, which means `n = 2` and `k = 2`.

The program first calculates `pownk1` which is `(k+1)^(n-1)`. In this case, it is `(2+1)^(2-1) = 3^1 = 3`.

Then, it calculates `total` by iterating from `0` to `k` (inclusive) and adding `i * pownk1 % MOD` to `total`. This results in `total = (0*3 + 1*3 + 2*3) % MOD = 9 % MOD = 9`. Since `n = 2`, `total` is then multiplied by `n` and taken modulo `MOD`, resulting in `total = (9 * 2) % MOD = 18`.

Next, the program initializes a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `[n+1][maxha+1]`, where `maxha = 100000`. It sets `dp[n][0] = 1`, which means `dp[2][0] = 1`.

The program then enters a nested loop to fill the `dp` array. The outer loop runs from `head = n` down to `1`, and the inner loop runs from `ha = 0` to `maxha`. For each `head` and `ha`, it checks if `dp[head][ha]` is not zero and then updates `dp[head-1][ha+canha]` or `dp[head-1][ha]` based on the value of `l` (which runs from `0` to `k`).

After filling the `dp` array, the program iterates over `dp[0]` from `0` to `maxha` and subtracts `dp[0][i] * i % MOD` from `total`, ensuring the result is modulo `MOD`.

Finally, the program prints `total % MOD`.

Let's calculate the `dp` array manually for `n = 2` and `k = 2`:

- `dp[2][0] = 1`
- For `head = 2` and `ha = 0`, we update `dp[1][0]`, `dp[1][1]`, and `dp[1][2]` to `1`.
- For `head = 1` and `ha = 0`, we update `dp[0][0]`, `dp[0][1]`, and `dp[0][2]` to `3` (since `dp[1][0] = 1` and we add it three times).
- For `head = 1` and `ha = 1`, we update `dp[0][1]` and `dp[0][2]` to `4` and `dp[0][3]` to `1` (since `dp[1][1] = 1` and we add it three times).
- For `head = 1` and `ha = 2`, we update `dp[0][2]` to `5` and `dp[0][3]` and `dp[0][4]` to `1` (since `dp[1][2] = 1` and we add it three times).

Now, we subtract the values of `dp[0][i] * i` from `total`:

- `total -= dp[0][1] * 1 % MOD = 18 - 4 % MOD = 14`
- `total -= dp[0][2] * 2 % MOD = 14 - 10 % MOD = 4`
- `total -= dp[0][3] * 3 % MOD = 4 - 3 % MOD = 1`
- `total -= dp[0][4] * 4 % MOD = 1 - 4 % MOD = MOD - 3 = 1000000004 % MOD = 3`

The final value of `total` is `3`.
