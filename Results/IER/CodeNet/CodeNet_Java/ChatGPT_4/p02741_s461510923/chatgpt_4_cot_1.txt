<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads an integer n from the input, which is 6 in this case. An array num is initialized with a predefined set of integers. The code then prints the value at the index n - 1 of the array num. Since arrays in Java are zero-indexed, the index n - 1 corresponds to the 6th element in the array because the input is 6. The 6th element in the array is at index 5 (since indexing starts from 0), which is the value 2. Therefore, the output will be the value at index 5 of the array num, which is 2.
