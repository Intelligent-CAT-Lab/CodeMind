<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `2`, which is assigned to the variable `n`. The program checks if `n` is equal to 2, and since it is, it prints out two lines "4 7" and "23 10" and then returns, which means the rest of the code is not executed. The special case for `n == 2` is handled separately, and the output is hardcoded.

<<<Output>>>
4 7
23 10
