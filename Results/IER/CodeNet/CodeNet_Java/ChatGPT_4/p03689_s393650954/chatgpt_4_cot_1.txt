The input provided is `3 3 2 2`, which corresponds to the variables hL, wL, hS, and wS respectively. These variables represent the height and width of the large rectangle (hL, wL) and the height and width of the small squares (hS, wS).

The `solve` method is called with these values. Inside the `solve` method, the following steps occur:

1. The `positiveElement` is calculated as `(limit - 1) / (hS * wS)`, where `limit` is `1_000_000_000`. With the given input, `positiveElement` is `(1_000_000_000 - 1) / (2 * 2) = 249999999`.

2. The `negativeElement` is calculated as `-1 * (positiveElement * (hS * wS - 1) + 1)`, which is `-1 * (249999999 * (2 * 2 - 1) + 1) = -749999998`.

3. `countH` and `countW` are the number of small squares that can fit in the height and width of the large rectangle, respectively. With the given input, `countH` is `3 / 2 = 1` and `countW` is `3 / 2 = 1`.

4. `restH` and `restW` are the remaining space in the height and width of the large rectangle after fitting the small squares. With the given input, `restH` is `3 % 2 = 1` and `restW` is `3 % 2 = 1`.

5. `count` is the total number of small squares that can fit in the large rectangle without considering the remaining space. With the given input, `count` is `1 * 1 = 1`.

6. `rest` is the total area of the remaining space in the large rectangle. With the given input, `rest` is `1 * 3 + 1 * 3 - 1 * 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5`.

7. The condition `if (positiveElement * rest - count <= 0)` checks if the sum of the positive elements in the remaining space minus the count of negative elements is less than or equal to zero. With the given input, this condition is `249999999 * 5 - 1 <= 0`, which is `1249999995 - 1 <= 0`, which is false.

Since the condition is false, the method proceeds to create an output list with "Yes" and then generates the large rectangle with the specified pattern of positive and negative elements.

The output will be a 3x3 matrix with `positiveElement` in all cells except the bottom-right cell of each 2x2 submatrix, which will have `negativeElement`. The matrix will look like this:

```
249999999 249999999 249999999
249999999 -749999998 249999999
249999999 249999999 249999999
```

<<<Output>>>
Yes
249999999 249999999 249999999 
249999999 -749999998 249999999 
249999999 249999999 249999999
