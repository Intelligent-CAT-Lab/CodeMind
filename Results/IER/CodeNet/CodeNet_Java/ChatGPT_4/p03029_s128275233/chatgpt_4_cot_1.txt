<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with the `main` method and a `FastScanner` class to read input efficiently. The `main` method creates an instance of `FastScanner` and reads two integers `a` and `p` from the input.

Given the input `1 3`, the variable `a` is assigned the value 1, and the variable `p` is assigned the value 3.

The next line calculates the value of `n` using the formula `(a*3 + p) / 2`. Substituting the values of `a` and `p`, we get:

n = (1*3 + 3) / 2
n = (3 + 3) / 2
n = 6 / 2
n = 3

Finally, the value of `n` is printed to the console.
