<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b, with a being 2 and b being 16. It then checks if the difference between a and b is even by using the modulo operator. If the difference is even, it calculates the average of a and b by adding them together and dividing by 2, and prints the result. If the difference is not even, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".

In this case, the difference between a and b is 16 - 2 = 14, which is even. Therefore, the code will calculate the average: (2 + 16) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9, and print that value.
<<<Output>>>
9
