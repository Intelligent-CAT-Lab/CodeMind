<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "internationalization" is read and stored in variable s. The length of the string is 20 characters.
A character array word of the same length as the input string is created.
The variable len is initialized with the length of the string minus 2, which is 18.
A for loop iterates over each character of the input string and assigns each character to the corresponding index in the word array.
After the loop, the program prints the first character of the word array, the value of len, and the last character of the word array concatenated as a string.
The first character of "internationalization" is 'i', and the last character is 'n'.
Therefore, the output will be the first character 'i', followed by the number 18 (the length of the string minus 2), followed by the last character 'n'.
