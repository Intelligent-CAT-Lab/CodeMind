<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized with 7, 5, and 1 respectively according to the input.
The code enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 4999. In each iteration, it checks if the expression (a * i) % b equals c.
The loop will terminate as soon as it finds an i that satisfies the condition. If it finds such an i, it will print "YES" and return, thus ending the program. If the loop completes all iterations without finding such an i, it will print "NO".

Let's check the first few iterations manually:
- For i = 0: (7 * 0) % 5 = 0 % 5 = 0, which is not equal to 1.
- For i = 1: (7 * 1) % 5 = 7 % 5 = 2, which is not equal to 1.
- For i = 2: (7 * 2) % 5 = 14 % 5 = 4, which is not equal to 1.
- For i = 3: (7 * 3) % 5 = 21 % 5 = 1, which is equal to 1.

Since the condition is satisfied when i = 3, the program will print "YES" and terminate.

<<<Output>>>
YES
