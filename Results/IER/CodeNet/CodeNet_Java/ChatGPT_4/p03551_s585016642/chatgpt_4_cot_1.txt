<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a Main class with a solve method, a FastScanner inner class for input handling, and a main method to run the program.

The main method creates an instance of Main and calls the run method. The run method initializes the FastScanner and PrintWriter objects, calls the solve method, and then closes the PrintWriter.

The solve method reads two integers n and m using the FastScanner object. According to the input, n is set to 1 and m is set to 1.

The solve method then calculates the result using the formula (1L << m) * (1900 * m + 100 * (n - m)). The expression (1L << m) calculates 2 to the power of m, which is 2^1 = 2 in this case. The expression (1900 * m + 100 * (n - m)) calculates the total time taken for the contest, which is 1900 * 1 + 100 * (1 - 1) = 1900 + 0 = 1900.

The final result is the product of these two expressions, which is 2 * 1900 = 3800.

The result is then printed to the console using the PrintWriter object.

3800
