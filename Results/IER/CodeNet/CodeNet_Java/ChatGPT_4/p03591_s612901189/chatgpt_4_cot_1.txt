<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with methods to read different types of input and a `solve` method that checks if the input string starts with "YAKI". The `run` method sets up the `BufferedReader` and `PrintWriter` for standard input and output, calls the `solve` method, and then closes the streams.

When the program runs, it calls the `run` method of a new `Main` object. The `run` method initializes the `BufferedReader` and `PrintWriter` to read from standard input and write to standard output.

The `solve` method is then called, which reads a string using the `nextToken` method. The `nextToken` method reads a line from the input and tokenizes it, returning the next token.

In this case, the input is "YAKINIKU". The `solve` method checks if this string starts with "YAKI" using the `startsWith` method. Since "YAKINIKU" does indeed start with "YAKI", the condition is true, and "Yes" is printed to the output.

Finally, the `BufferedReader` and `PrintWriter` are closed, and the program ends.
