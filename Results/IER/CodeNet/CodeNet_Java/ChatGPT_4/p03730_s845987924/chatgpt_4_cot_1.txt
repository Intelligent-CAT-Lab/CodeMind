<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized with 7, 5, and 1 respectively according to the input.
The code enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to B (5 in this case).

In each iteration, it checks if the remainder of (A * i) divided by B is equal to C. The condition is checked for i = 1 to 5 as follows:
- For i = 1: (7 * 1) % 5 = 2 % 5 = 2, which is not equal to C (1).
- For i = 2: (7 * 2) % 5 = 14 % 5 = 4, which is not equal to C (1).
- For i = 3: (7 * 3) % 5 = 21 % 5 = 1, which is equal to C (1).

Since the condition is met when i = 3, the program prints "YES" and returns, thus ending the execution without checking the remaining iterations.

<<<Output>>>
YES
