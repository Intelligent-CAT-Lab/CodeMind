<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The code then checks if A is greater than B, which is not the case here, so it does not print -1 and does not return early.

Next, the code enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to 99999999. For each iteration, it calculates 8% of i (i * 0.08) and 10% of i (i * 0.10), and then it casts these values to int, effectively truncating the decimal part.

The code is looking for the smallest integer i such that 8% of i is equal to A and 10% of i is equal to B. Since A and B are both 2, the code is looking for an integer i such that both (int)(i * 0.08) and (int)(i * 0.10) are equal to 2.

The first integer that satisfies both conditions is 25 because:
- (int)(25 * 0.08) = (int)(2.0) = 2
- (int)(25 * 0.10) = (int)(2.5) = 2

Since 25 is the first integer that satisfies both conditions, the loop will break and the code will print 25 as the output.

<<<Output>>>
25
