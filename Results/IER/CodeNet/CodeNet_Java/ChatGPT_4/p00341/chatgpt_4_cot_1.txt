<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to read 12 integers from the input, add them to a LinkedList, and then perform some checks to determine if the output should be "yes" or "no".

1. The Scanner object `sc` is created to read input from the standard input.
2. A LinkedList `e` is created to store integers.
3. A for loop runs 12 times to read 12 integers from the input and add them to the LinkedList `e`.
4. The input `1 1 3 4 8 9 7 3 4 5 5 5` is read and added to the LinkedList `e`.
5. The code checks if there are more than 3 distinct numbers in the LinkedList using `e.stream().distinct().count()`. If there are more than 3 distinct numbers, it prints "no" and returns.
6. Since there are 7 distinct numbers in the input (1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 7, 5), the condition is true, and the program prints "no".
7. The program exits after printing "no", so the rest of the code is not executed.

The output is determined after step 6, where the condition for having more than 3 distinct numbers is met.
