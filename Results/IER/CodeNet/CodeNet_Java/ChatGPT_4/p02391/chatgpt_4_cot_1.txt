<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into two strings based on a space character. These strings are then parsed into integers x and y with the values 1 and 2, respectively, according to the input provided.

The code then has three if statements (not else-if statements) to compare the values of x and y:
1. The first if statement checks if x is equal to y, which is not true in this case (1 is not equal to 2).
2. The second if statement checks if x is less than y, which is true (1 is less than 2).
3. The third if statement checks if x is greater than y, which is not true (1 is not greater than 2).

Since the second if statement is the only one that evaluates to true, the code will execute the corresponding block and print "a < b".

Note that the code does not use else-if or else statements, so each if statement is evaluated independently. This means that if multiple conditions were true, multiple lines would be printed. However, in this case, only one condition is true.
<<<Output>>>
a < b
