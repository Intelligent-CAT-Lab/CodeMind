<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `2 3 9`. The variables a, b, and c are initialized with these values respectively. The variable d is calculated as c - a - b, which is 9 - 2 - 3 = 4.

The condition in the if statement checks two things:
1. Whether d is greater than 0, which is true since d is 4.
2. Whether 4 * a * b is less than d * d, which translates to 4 * 2 * 3 < 4 * 4. This simplifies to 24 < 16, which is false.

Since the second condition is false, the program will not enter the if block and will instead execute the else block, printing "No".

<<<Output>>>
No
