<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 20 according to the input.
The code then calculates the output by multiplying n by 800 and subtracting the result of integer division of n by 15, multiplied by 200.
The multiplication n*800 results in 20*800 = 16000.
The integer division n/15 results in 20/15 = 1 (since it's integer division, the fractional part is discarded).
Then 1*200 = 200.
Finally, the code subtracts 200 from 16000, resulting in 16000 - 200 = 15800.
The code then prints the result, which is 15800.
<<<Output>>>
15800
