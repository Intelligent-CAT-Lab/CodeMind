The variable X is initialized with 33 according to the input.

A 5th power table (fiveExp) is created for numbers from 0 to 999. Each entry in the table is the 5th power of its index.

The code then searches for two integers A and B such that either A^5 - B^5 = X or A^5 + B^5 = X.

The nested loops iterate over all possible pairs of A and B (from 0 to 999). For each pair, it first checks if A^5 - B^5 equals X. If not, it checks if A^5 + B^5 equals X.

When the input X is 33, the code will find that 2^5 - (-3)^5 equals 33 (since 32 - (-243) = 33). Therefore, A is set to 2 and B is set to -3.

The loop is then terminated using the label "LOOP" and the break statement.

Finally, the code prints the values of A and B, which are 2 and -3 respectively.

2 -3
