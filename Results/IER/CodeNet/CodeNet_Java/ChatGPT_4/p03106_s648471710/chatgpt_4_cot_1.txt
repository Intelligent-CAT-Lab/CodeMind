The variables a, b, and k are initialized with 8, 12, and 2 respectively according to the input. The variable smaller is initialized with the minimum of a and b, which is 8.
An Integer array named divisors is created with a size of smaller+1, which is 9 in this case.

The for loop initializes all elements of the divisors array to 0.

Another for loop iterates from 1 to smaller (inclusive). For each i, it checks if both a and b are divisible by i. If they are, it assigns the value of i to the ith position in the divisors array.

After the loop, the divisors array contains the common divisors of a and b at the indices corresponding to their value. The divisors array before sorting looks like this:
[0, 1, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8]

The Arrays.sort method is called with Collections.reverseOrder() to sort the divisors array in descending order. After sorting, the divisors array looks like this:
[8, 4, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Finally, the code prints the element at index k-1 of the sorted divisors array, which is divisors[1] in this case because k is 2. The element at index 1 is 4.

<<<Output>>>
4
