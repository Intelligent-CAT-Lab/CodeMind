<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that creates an instance of a `Solver` class and calls its `solve` method, then exits. The `Solver` class contains methods for input parsing and output formatting, as well as the `solve` method where the actual logic for the problem is implemented.

The `solve` method reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` using the `ni()` method, which internally uses a `FastScanner` to read the next long integer from the input stream and cast it to an int. The input provided is `13 3 1`.

The `solve` method then calculates the result of the expression `(x - z) / (y + z)` using integer division and prints the result using the `prtln` method. The `prtln` method is a wrapper around `System.out.println`.

Given the input `13 3 1`, the calculation will be as follows:
- `x` is 13
- `y` is 3
- `z` is 1

The expression becomes `(13 - 1) / (3 + 1)`, which simplifies to `12 / 4`. Since this is integer division, the result is `3`.

Therefore, the output of the code execution will be `3`.
