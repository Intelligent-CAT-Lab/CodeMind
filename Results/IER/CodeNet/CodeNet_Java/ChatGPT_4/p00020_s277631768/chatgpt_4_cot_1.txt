<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a new Scanner object to read from System.in. It then reads a line of input using sc.nextLine(), which in this case is "this is a pen.". The read line is then converted to uppercase using the toUpperCase() method. The result "THIS IS A PEN." is then printed to the console using the println() method. After printing, the Scanner object is closed using sc.close(). The output will be the input string in uppercase letters.
<<<Output>>>
THIS IS A PEN.
