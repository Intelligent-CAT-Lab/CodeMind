<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized with 10000 according to the input. The variable max is initialized with the maximum value an int can have (Integer.MAX_VALUE).
The code then enters a for loop that iterates over all long integers i such that i squared is less than or equal to num (10000). This means it will check all factors of 10000 up to its square root.

For each iteration, the code checks if num is divisible by i (i.e., if i is a factor of num). If it is, the code calculates the corresponding factor (num / i) and converts both i and (num / i) to strings s and str, respectively.

It then calculates the maximum length of the string representations of i and (num / i) and compares it with the current value of max. If the maximum length x is less than max, max is updated to x.

The factors of 10000 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 5000, and 10000. The loop will only iterate through the factors up to the square root of 10000, which is 100. The corresponding factors are 10000, 5000, 2500, 2000, 1250, 1000, 500, 400, 250, 200, 125, 100.

The maximum string length of these factor pairs will be the smallest when the factors are closest to each other, which is when i is 100 and (num / i) is also 100. Both have a string length of 3.

Therefore, max will be updated to 3, which is the minimum length of the string representation of the factors of 10000.

Finally, the code prints the value of max and flushes the BufferedWriter (although the BufferedWriter is not used for printing in this code).
