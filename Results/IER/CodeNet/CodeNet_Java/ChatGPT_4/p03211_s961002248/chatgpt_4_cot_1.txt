<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "1234567876" is read and each character of the string is converted to an integer and stored in the array `arr`. The array `arr` will contain the following integers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 6].

The variable `min` is initialized with the maximum value an integer can have.

The program then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the string minus 3 (since it's checking triplets of numbers).

Inside the loop, the method `abc` is called with three consecutive numbers from the array `arr`. The method `abc` calculates the absolute difference between the number formed by the three digits and the number 753.

The loop iterates and calculates the following values:
- For i = 0 (123): |123 - 753| = 630
- For i = 1 (234): |234 - 753| = 519
- For i = 2 (345): |345 - 753| = 408
- For i = 3 (456): |456 - 753| = 297
- For i = 4 (567): |567 - 753| = 186
- For i = 5 (678): |678 - 753| = 75
- For i = 6 (787): |787 - 753| = 34
- For i = 7 (876): |876 - 753| = 123
- For i = 8 (767): |767 - 753| = 14

The minimum value found is 14, which occurs when i = 8.

After the loop finishes, the program prints the minimum value found, which is 14.

14
