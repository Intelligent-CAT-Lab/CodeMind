<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `x` of size 5 and a variable `sum` with the value 0. It then enters a for loop that iterates 5 times to read 5 integers from the input using a Scanner object.

The input provided is `0 2 3 4 5`. The loop will execute 5 times, and in each iteration, it will read one number from the input and add it to the `sum`. The sum of the numbers will be calculated as follows:

- First iteration: `x[0] = 0`, `sum = 0 + 0 = 0`
- Second iteration: `x[1] = 2`, `sum = 0 + 2 = 2`
- Third iteration: `x[2] = 3`, `sum = 2 + 3 = 5`
- Fourth iteration: `x[3] = 4`, `sum = 5 + 4 = 9`
- Fifth iteration: `x[4] = 5`, `sum = 9 + 5 = 14`

After the loop, the code prints `15 - sum`, which is `15 - 14 = 1`.

Therefore, the output of the code will be `1`.
