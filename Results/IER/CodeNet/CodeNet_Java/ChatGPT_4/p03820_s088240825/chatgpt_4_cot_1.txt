<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `2 1`, which means `n = 2` and `k = 1`. The `base` is calculated as `n - k + 1`, which is `2`.

The `answer` and `sum` arrays are initialized with dimensions `[n + 1][n + 1]` and filled with `-1`.

The `go` method is called with parameters `n` and `n`, which are both `2`. Since `answer[2][2]` is `-1`, it proceeds to check if `n` is equal to `base`. Since `n` is equal to `base`, it sets `answer[2][2]` to `1`.

The `goSum` method is not called because `lim` is not less than `1`.

The final `answer` is calculated by multiplying the result of `go(n, n)` which is `1` by `IntegerUtils.power(2, Math.max(n - k - 1, 0), MiscUtils.MOD7)`. Since `n - k - 1` is `0`, the power function is called with `2^0 mod MiscUtils.MOD7`, which is `1`.

Therefore, the final `answer` is `1 * 1 % MiscUtils.MOD7`, which is `1`.

The `out.printLine(answer)` prints the final answer, which is `1`.
