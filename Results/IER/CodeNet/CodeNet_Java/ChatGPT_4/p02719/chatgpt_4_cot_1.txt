<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers from the input, which are 7 (n) and 4 (k). It then calculates the remainder of n divided by k, which is 7 % 4 = 3. Next, it calculates k minus the remainder of n divided by k, which is 4 - (7 % 4) = 4 - 3 = 1. The code then uses the Math.min function to find the minimum of these two values, which are 3 and 1. The minimum value is 1. Finally, the code prints out the result, which is 1.
