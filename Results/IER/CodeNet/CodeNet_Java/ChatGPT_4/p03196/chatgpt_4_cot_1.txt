<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3 24`. The main method creates an instance of Solver and calls its solve method. The solve method reads two long values, `n` and `p`, which are `3` and `24` respectively.

The `factor` method is called with `p` as the argument. This method finds the prime factors of `p` and their degrees (the number of times the prime factor divides `p`). For `p = 24`, the prime factors are `2` and `3`, with degrees `3` and `1` respectively. The `factor` method returns a 2D array with these values.

The `solve` method then initializes `ans` to `1` and iterates over the array of factors. For each factor, it checks if the degree of the factor is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, it multiplies `ans` by the factor raised to the power of the integer division of the degree by `n`.

For the factor `2` with degree `3`, since `3` is equal to `n`, `ans` is multiplied by `2` raised to the power of `3 / 3`, which is `1`. So `ans` becomes `2`.
For the factor `3` with degree `1`, since `1` is less than `n`, it does not affect `ans`.

Finally, the `solve` method prints the value of `ans`, which is `2`.
