<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables implicitly. The first integer is 100 and the second integer is 17. It then calculates the difference between the two integers by subtracting the second integer from the first, resulting in sum = 100 - 17, which equals 83.

The if statement checks if the calculated sum is less than or equal to 0. Since 83 is greater than 0, the condition is false, and the else block is executed.

The else block prints the value of sum, which is 83.

<<<Output>>>
83
