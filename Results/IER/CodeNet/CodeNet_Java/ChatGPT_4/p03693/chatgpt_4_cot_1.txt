<<<Analysis>>>
The Scanner object is created to read input from the standard input stream. The nextInt() method is called three times to read three integers from the input, which are 4, 3, and 2 respectively.

Each of these integers is then multiplied by a different factor:
- The first integer (r) is multiplied by 100, resulting in 400.
- The second integer (g) is multiplied by 10, resulting in 30.
- The third integer (b) is not multiplied by any factor, so it remains 2.

The sum of these three values is calculated:
sum = r + g + b
sum = 400 + 30 + 2
sum = 432

The program then checks if the sum is divisible by 4 using the modulo operator (%):
432 % 4 == 0

Since 432 is divisible by 4, the condition is true.

Based on the condition, the ternary operator (?) will return "YES" if the condition is true, and "NO" if the condition is false.

Since the condition is true, "YES" is printed to the standard output.
