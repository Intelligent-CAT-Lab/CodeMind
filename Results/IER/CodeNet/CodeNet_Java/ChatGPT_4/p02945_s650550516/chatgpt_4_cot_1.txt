<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the input, which are -13 and 3 respectively. It then calculates three expressions: a+b, a-b, and a*b, which are -13+3, -13-3, and -13*3 respectively. The results of these expressions are -10, -16, and -39. The code uses the Math.max function to find the maximum value among these three results. The maximum value between -10 and -16 is -10, and the maximum value between -10 and -39 is -10. Therefore, the final output is the maximum value, which is -10.
