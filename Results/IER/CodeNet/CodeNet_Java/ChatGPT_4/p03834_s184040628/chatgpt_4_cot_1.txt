<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. The input string is `happy,newyear,enjoy`. The `solve` method is then called with the Scanner object as an argument.

Inside the `solve` method, the `replaceAll` method is called on the string `a`. This method replaces all occurrences of the comma character `,` with a single space character ` `. The resulting string is `happy newyear enjoy`.

Finally, the modified string is printed to the console.

<<<Output>>>
happy newyear enjoy
