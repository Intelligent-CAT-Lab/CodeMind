<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from System.in. It then reads two integers, n and m, which are 3 and 100 respectively according to the input.

The code checks if n is odd by using the modulo operator (n % 2 != 0). Since n is 3, which is odd, it enters the if block.

Inside the if block, it calculates fst as the integer division of n by 2 plus 1, which is (3/2) + 1 = 2. It also calculates snd as the integer division of n by 2, which is 3/2 = 1.

The code then enters a for loop that runs fst times (2 times) and prints 0 with a space in front of it, except for the first iteration. The output after this loop is "0 0".

Next, it enters another for loop that runs snd times (1 time) and prints m (100) with a space in front of it. The output after this loop is "0 0 100".

Finally, the code prints a newline character, and the program terminates.

0 0 100
