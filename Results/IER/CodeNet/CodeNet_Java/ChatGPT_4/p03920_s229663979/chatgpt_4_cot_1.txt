<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input. The variable sum is initialized with 0, and an ArrayList of Integer type named l is created.
The program enters a for loop that starts with i=1 and continues as long as sum is less than or equal to n. In each iteration, it adds the value of i to sum and then adds i to the ArrayList l.
The loop runs as follows:
- i=1: sum=0+1=1, l=[1]
- i=2: sum=1+2=3, l=[1, 2]
- i=3: sum=3+3=6, l=[1, 2, 3]

At this point, sum (6) is greater than n (4), so the loop stops.
Next, the program removes the Integer value of (sum-n) from the ArrayList l, which is (6-4)=2.
So, the ArrayList l after removal is [1, 3].
Finally, the program prints each element of the ArrayList l using a stream and forEach with a method reference to System.out.println.
