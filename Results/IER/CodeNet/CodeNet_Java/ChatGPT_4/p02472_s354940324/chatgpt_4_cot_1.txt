<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two strings representing numbers using `sc.next()` and converts them into BigInteger objects A and B. The input provided is "5" and "8", which are converted to BigInteger objects with the same values.

After reading the inputs, the Scanner object is closed using `sc.close()`. The code then calculates the sum of the two BigInteger objects A and B using the `add` method and prints the result to the standard output.

In this case, the sum of the BigInteger objects A (5) and B (8) is 13. Therefore, the output will be the result of this addition, which is 13.
