<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into three integers using a StringTokenizer. These integers are stored in the array `k1`. The input provided is `1000 3000 3000`, so `k1[0]` will be 1000, `k1[1]` will be 3000, and `k1[2]` will be 3000.

The variable `kariiregaku` is calculated as `k1[2] - k1[0]`, which is `3000 - 1000`, resulting in 2000. Since `kariiregaku` is not less than 0, its value remains 2000.

The code then checks if `k1[1]` is greater than or equal to `kariiregaku`. In this case, `k1[1]` is 3000, which is indeed greater than or equal to `kariiregaku` (2000).

Since the condition is true, the code prints the value of `kariiregaku`, which is 2000.

The code is designed to run in a continuous loop, reading lines until there is no more input. However, since we are only considering a single line of input, the output will be the result of processing this single line.

2000
