<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "abac". The program initializes an array `abc` of size 3 to store the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' respectively.

The program then iterates over each character in the input string "abac" and increments the corresponding count in the `abc` array. The counts after the loop will be:
- 'a' appears 2 times
- 'b' appears 1 time
- 'c' appears 1 time

So, the `abc` array will be [2, 1, 1].

Next, the program sorts the `abc` array, which will result in [1, 1, 2].

The program then checks if the difference between the middle element and the first element is less than 2 (`abc[1] - abc[0] < 2`) and if the difference between the last element and the first element is less than 2 (`abc[2] - abc[0] < 2`). Both conditions are true because:
- `abc[1] - abc[0]` is `1 - 1` which equals `0` (0 < 2 is true)
- `abc[2] - abc[0]` is `2 - 1` which equals `1` (1 < 2 is true)

Since both conditions are true, the program prints "YES".

<<<Output>>>
YES
