<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `0`. The code starts by creating an instance of `MyScanner` and uses it to read the input as a `long` value. The `run` method is then called on the new instance of `Main`.

Inside the `run` method, the variable `N` is assigned the value `0` from the input. A variable `cnt` is initialized to `0`. The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as `N` is greater than `0`. However, since `N` is `0`, the loop condition is not satisfied, and the loop is not executed even once.

Since the loop does not run, the value of `cnt` remains `0`. The code then prints the value of `cnt`, which is `0`.
