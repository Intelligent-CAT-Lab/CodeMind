<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input.
The input provided is `5 4`, so a is set to 5 and b is set to 4.
The code then checks if both a and b are less than or equal to 8.
Since both 5 and 4 satisfy this condition, the code will execute the block inside the if statement and print "Yay!".
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
