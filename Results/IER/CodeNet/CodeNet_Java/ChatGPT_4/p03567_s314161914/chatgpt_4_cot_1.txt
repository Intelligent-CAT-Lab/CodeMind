<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `main` method that uses a `FastScanner` object to read a string `s` from the standard input. The `FastScanner` class is designed to read input efficiently.

The `main` method reads a single string `s` using `scan.next()`. After reading the string, it checks if the string contains the substring "AC" using `s.indexOf("AC")`. If the substring "AC" is found, the `indexOf` method will return a non-negative index where the substring starts. If it is not found, `indexOf` will return -1.

The ternary operator checks if the result of `indexOf` is not equal to -1. If true, it means the substring "AC" is present in the input string, and the program will output "Yes". Otherwise, it will output "No".

Given the input `BACD`, the string does contain "AC", so the output will be "Yes".
