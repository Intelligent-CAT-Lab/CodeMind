<<<Analysis>>>
The input "36" is read and stored in the string N, which is then prefixed with "0" to become "036". The length of N is 3.

The 2D array dp is initialized with dimensions 4x3 (since l is 3, l+1 is 4). The first row of dp is initialized with dp[0][0] and dp[0][2] set to 1.

The for loop iterates from i = 1 to i = 2 (since l is 3). Inside the loop, the following calculations are performed:

For i = 1:
- c is the integer value of the first character of N (after the prefixed "0"), which is '3', so c = 3.
- dp[1][0] is calculated as the minimum of dp[0][0] and dp[0][2] (which are both 1) plus 9 - c, which is 1 + 9 - 3 = 7.
- dp[1][1] is calculated as the minimum of dp[0][0] + 1 and dp[0][1] (which is 0 by default) plus c, which is 1 + 3 = 4.
- dp[1][2] is calculated as the minimum of dp[0][0] + 1 and dp[0][1] plus c + 1, which is 1 + 3 + 1 = 5.

For i = 2:
- c is the integer value of the second character of N, which is '6', so c = 6.
- dp[2][0] is calculated as the minimum of dp[1][0] and dp[1][2] (which are 7 and 5) plus 9 - c, which is 5 + 9 - 6 = 8.
- dp[2][1] is calculated as the minimum of dp[1][0] + 1 and dp[1][1] (which are 8 and 4) plus c, which is 4 + 6 = 10.
- dp[2][2] is calculated as the minimum of dp[1][0] + 1 and dp[1][1] plus c + 1, which is 4 + 6 + 1 = 11.

After the loop, dp[l - 1][0] is incremented by 1, so dp[2][0] becomes 9.

Finally, the minimum of dp[2][0], dp[2][1], and dp[2][2] is calculated, which is the minimum of 9, 10, and 11. The minimum is 9.

Therefore, the output of the code execution is 9.
