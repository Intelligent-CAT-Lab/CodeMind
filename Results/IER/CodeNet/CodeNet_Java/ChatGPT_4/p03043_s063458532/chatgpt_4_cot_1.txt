The variable n is initialized with 3.0 (double) and variable k is initialized with 10 (int) according to the input. The Scanner is then closed as it is no longer needed.
The variable winRatio is initialized with 0.0 (double).
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the win ratio for each i by doubling the value of x until it is not less than k (10 in this case). For each doubling of x, it also doubles the value of m.
The win ratio for each i is calculated as (1/n) / m and added to the total winRatio.
For i = 1, x is doubled 4 times to reach 16, so m is 2^4 = 16. The win ratio for i = 1 is (1/3) / 16.
For i = 2, x is doubled 3 times to reach 16, so m is 2^3 = 8. The win ratio for i = 2 is (1/3) / 8.
For i = 3, x is doubled 2 times to reach 12, so m is 2^2 = 4. The win ratio for i = 3 is (1/3) / 4.
The total winRatio is the sum of the win ratios for i = 1, 2, and 3.
Calculating the win ratios:
For i = 1: (1/3) / 16 = 1/48
For i = 2: (1/3) / 8 = 1/24
For i = 3: (1/3) / 4 = 1/12
Adding them together: 1/48 + 1/24 + 1/12 = 1/48 + 2/48 + 4/48 = 7/48
The final winRatio is 7/48, which is approximately 0.14583333333333334 when printed out as a double.
