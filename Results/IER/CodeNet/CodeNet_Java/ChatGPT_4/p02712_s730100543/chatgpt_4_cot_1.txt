<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 15 according to the input. The variable sum is initialized with 0.
The code enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to 15. For each iteration, it checks if the current integer i is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5.
If the condition is true (i.e., i is not divisible by both 3 and 5), it adds the value of i to the sum.
The numbers from 1 to 15 that are not divisible by 3 and 5 are: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14.
The sum of these numbers is calculated as follows:
1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 13 + 14 = 60
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of sum as output, which is 60.
<<<Output>>>
60
