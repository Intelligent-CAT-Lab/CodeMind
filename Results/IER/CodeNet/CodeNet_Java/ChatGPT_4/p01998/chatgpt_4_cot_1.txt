<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. A boolean array arr of size n + 3 (which is 6) is created and initialized with all elements as false except for the first two elements which are set to true.

The code then enters a for loop that starts from 2 and goes up to the length of the array (6). This loop is used to mark all non-prime numbers in the array as true using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

- i = 2: Since arr[2] is false, it enters the inner loop to mark multiples of 2 as true. arr[4] is set to true. Then it checks if both arr[2] and arr[0] are false, which is not the case since arr[0] is true. So, count remains 0.
- i = 3: Since arr[3] is false, it enters the inner loop to mark multiples of 3 as true. However, 3*2 is 6, which is the length of the array, so no elements are marked. Then it checks if both arr[3] and arr[1] are false, which is not the case since arr[1] is true. So, count remains 0.
- i = 4: arr[4] is true, so the loop continues without entering the inner loop or incrementing count.
- i = 5: Since arr[5] is false, it does not enter the inner loop. Then it checks if both arr[5] and arr[3] are false, which is true. So, count is incremented to 1.

After the loop finishes, the final value of count is 1. The output is then count * 2, which is 2.
