<<<Analysis>>>
The input `1 1 1` initializes the variables x, y, and z with the value 1. The variables B and C are initialized with the minimum and maximum of y and z, respectively, which in this case are both 1.

The `prec(1000000)` function call initializes the factorial and inverse factorial arrays `_fact` and `_invfact` for values up to 1000000. These arrays are used to calculate combinations efficiently.

The `pow3` array is initialized to store powers of 3 modulo MOD, where MOD is 1000000007. This array is filled with values from 1 to 3^(999999) % MOD.

The `ans` array is initialized to store the answers for each possible length from x+1 to x+y+z+1, which in this case is from 2 to 4.

The for loop iterates over the possible lengths `l` from 2 to 4. For each length, it calculates the number of ways to choose x-1 spaces from l-2 spaces using the `comb` function, which calculates combinations modulo MOD.

The variable `last` is used to store the number of ways to fill the remaining spaces after choosing x-1 spaces. It is updated based on the number of remaining spaces (`row`) and the values of B and C.

The final answer for each length `l` is calculated by multiplying the base number of combinations, the number of ways to fill the remaining spaces, and the corresponding power of 3 for the remaining length. This is done modulo MOD.

The sum of all answers in the `ans` array is calculated and printed modulo MOD.

Given the input `1 1 1`, the calculations will be as follows:

- For l = 2, space = 0, base = comb(0, 0) = 1, row = 0, last = 1, ans[2] = 1 * 1 * 3^(3-2) % MOD = 3.
- For l = 3, space = 1, base = comb(1, 0) = 1, row = 1, last = (1 * 2) % MOD = 2, ans[3] = 1 * 2 * 3^(3-3) % MOD = 2.
- For l = 4, space = 2, base = comb(2, 0) = 1, row = 2, last = (2 * 2 - comb(1, 1)) % MOD = 3, ans[4] = 1 * 3 * 3^(3-4) % MOD = 3.

The sum of the answers is 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, the output will be 8 % MOD, which is 8 since 8 is less than MOD.
