<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate a probability based on the given input parameters n, m, and d. The Scanner class is used to read these inputs from the standard input.

1. The Scanner object `sc` is created to read from `System.in`.
2. The integers n, m, and d are read from the input and assigned the values 2, 3, and 1 respectively.
3. The variable `diff` is calculated. Since d is not equal to 0, diff is set to 2.
4. The variable `result` is calculated using the formula `((n - d) * diff / Math.pow(n, 2)) * (m - 1)`.
   - Substituting the values, we get `((2 - 1) * 2 / Math.pow(2, 2)) * (3 - 1)`.
   - This simplifies to `((1 * 2) / 4) * 2`.
   - Which further simplifies to `(2 / 4) * 2`.
   - And finally to `0.5 * 2`, which equals `1.0`.
5. The result is printed out formatted to 10 decimal places.

The output will be the value of `result` formatted to 10 decimal places, which is `1.0000000000`.
