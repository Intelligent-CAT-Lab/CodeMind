<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four integers from the input using a Scanner object. These integers are added in pairs:
- The first two integers (3 and 8) are added and assigned to variable 'a', resulting in a value of 11.
- The next two integers (7 and 1) are added and assigned to variable 'b', resulting in a value of 8.

The code then uses a ternary operator to compare the values of 'a' and 'b':
- If 'a' is greater than 'b' (which is true in this case, since 11 > 8), it prints "Left".
- If 'a' is equal to 'b', it prints "Balanced".
- If 'a' is less than 'b', it prints "Right".

Since 'a' is greater than 'b', the output will be "Left".
