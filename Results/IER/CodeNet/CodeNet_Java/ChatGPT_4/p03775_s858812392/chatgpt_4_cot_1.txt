<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10000 according to the input. The variable rootN is calculated as the square root of N, which is the square root of 10000, resulting in 100.0.
The variable min is initialized with the maximum value an integer can have.

The for loop iterates from 1 to 100 (inclusive) to find the factors of N (10000). For each i in this range, it checks if i is a factor of N by checking if N % i is not equal to 0. If it is not a factor, it continues to the next iteration.

When it finds a factor (i), it calculates the maximum number of digits between the factor i and its corresponding factor N / i using the digitCount function. It then compares this maximum digit count with the current minimum digit count stored in min. If the calculated digit count is less than min, it updates min with this new value.

The digitCount function simply counts the number of digits in a given number by dividing the number by 10 until it becomes 0, incrementing a count each time.

For N = 10000, the factors are (1, 10000), (2, 5000), (4, 2500), (5, 2000), (8, 1250), (10, 1000), (16, 625), (20, 500), (25, 400), (40, 250), (50, 200), (80, 125), (100, 100). The maximum digit counts for these pairs are 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 respectively.

The minimum digit count among these is 3, which is the output of the program.
