The input is `3`, which is assigned to the variable `N`. The `solve` method is then called with `N` as the argument.

The `solve` method is a recursive method that calculates a value based on the input `n`. It uses a `HashMap` named `check` to store previously calculated values to avoid redundant calculations (memoization).

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the recursive calls:

1. `solve(3)` is called.
2. Since `n` is not 0 or 1, it checks if `check` contains the key `3/2` (which is `1` after integer division). It does not, so it calls `solve(1)`.
3. `solve(1)` returns `2` because `n` is 1. This value is stored in `check` with the key `1`.
4. Now back in `solve(3)`, it checks if `check` contains the key `3/2-1` (which is `0`). It does not, so it calls `solve(0)`.
5. `solve(0)` returns `1` because `n` is 0. This value is stored in `check` with the key `0`.
6. Now back in `solve(3)`, since `n` is odd (`3 % 2 == 1`), it calculates `(2*a + b) % 1000000007`, where `a` is `2` (from `solve(1)`) and `b` is `1` (from `solve(0)`).
7. The calculation is `(2*2 + 1) % 1000000007`, which equals `5`.

The final result of `solve(3)` is `5`, and this is printed as the output of the program.
