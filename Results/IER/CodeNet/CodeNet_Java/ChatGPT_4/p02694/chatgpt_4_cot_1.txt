The variable x is initialized with 103 according to the input. The variable count is initialized with 0, and variable a is initialized with 100.
The code enters a while loop that will continue indefinitely until the condition inside the loop is met.
Inside the while loop, it first checks if variable a is greater than or equal to x. If it is, the loop will break.
If not, variable a is increased by 1% of its current value (a = a + a/100), and the variable count is incremented by 1.
The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: a = 100 + 100/100 = 100 + 1 = 101, count = 1
- Second iteration: a = 101 + 101/100 = 101 + 1.01 = 102.01, count = 2
- Third iteration: a = 102.01 + 102.01/100 = 102.01 + 1.0201 â‰ˆ 103.0301, count = 3
Now a is 103.0301, which is greater than x (103), so the loop breaks.
The final value of count is 3, which is printed as the output.
