<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three integer variables N, A, and B with the input values 7, 17, and 120 respectively. It then calculates the product of N and A and stores it in the variable pp (pp = N * A = 7 * 17 = 119).

Next, the code checks if pp is greater than B. If it is, it prints B; otherwise, it prints pp. In this case, since pp (119) is not greater than B (120), the condition is false.

Therefore, the code will print the value of pp, which is 119.
<<<Output>>>
119
