<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads a single string `s` from the input, which is "sippuu" in this case.

The if statement checks two conditions:
1. Whether the character at index 2 is the same as the character at index 3.
2. Whether the character at index 4 is the same as the character at index 5.

In the given string "sippuu":
- The character at index 2 is 'p'.
- The character at index 3 is also 'p'.
- The character at index 4 is 'u'.
- The character at index 5 is also 'u'.

Since both conditions are true (the characters at the specified indices are the same), the code will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
