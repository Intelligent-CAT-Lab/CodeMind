<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `1 3`. The variables x and y are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively. The arrays grp1, grp2, and grp3 are initialized with specific sets of integers.

The main method calls the grouped method twice, once with grp1 and once with grp2, passing x and y as arguments to check if both x and y are present in the same group.

The grouped method iterates through the elements of the passed array and sets bx to true if x is found and by to true if y is found. If both bx and by are true, it means both x and y are in the same group, and the method returns true.

For grp1, which contains 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, both x (1) and y (3) are found, so grouped(grp1, x, y) returns true.

grp2 and grp3 are not checked because the logical OR operator short-circuits the evaluation as soon as the first true value is encountered.

Since grouped(grp1, x, y) returns true, the ternary operator in the println statement evaluates to "Yes".

Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
