<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, N and i, from the input. According to the given input, N is assigned the value 4 and i is assigned the value 2.

The Scanner object is then closed to prevent resource leaks.

The code then calculates the expression N-i+1, which is 4-2+1, and prints the result to the standard output.

The calculation is straightforward:
4 (value of N) - 2 (value of i) + 1 = 3

Therefore, the output will be the result of this calculation, which is 3.
