<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and M are initialized with 1 and 6 respectively according to the input. The variable sum is initialized with 0.

The first if condition checks if N multiplied by 2 is greater than M, which would be 2 * 1 > 6, which is false.

The else if condition checks if M is greater than N multiplied by 2, which would be 6 > 1 * 2, which is true.

Since the else if condition is true, the code executes the block inside it:
- It first assigns the value of N to sum, so sum becomes 1.
- Then it calculates (M - N * 2) / 4, which is (6 - 1 * 2) / 4 = (6 - 2) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1.
- It adds this value to sum, so sum becomes 1 + 1 = 2.

Finally, the code prints the value of sum, which is 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
