<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `2 6`. The variable `n` is initialized with `2` and `m` with `6`.

The `solve` method of `TaskX` class is called with these values. A `TreeMap` named `map` is created to store the prime factors of `m` and their counts.

The prime factorization of `m` (which is `6`) is performed. The prime factors of `6` are `2` and `3`, each with a count of `1`. These are added to the `map`.

The variable `ans` is initialized with `1`. The method then iterates over the values of the `map` (which are the counts of the prime factors) and calculates the combination of `(n + c - 1)` choose `(n - 1)` for each count `c`, where `n` is `2`. The combination is calculated using the `comb` method, which uses precomputed factorial and factorial inverse arrays modulo `MOD`.

For the prime factor `2` with count `1`, the combination is `(2 + 1 - 1)` choose `(2 - 1)` which is `2` choose `1`. The result is `2`.

For the prime factor `3` with count `1`, the combination is `(2 + 1 - 1)` choose `(2 - 1)` which is `2` choose `1`. The result is `2`.

The final answer is the product of these combinations modulo `MOD`. So, `ans = (1 * 2 * 2) % MOD = 4 % MOD = 4`.

The output is then printed, which is the value of `ans` modulo `MOD`, which is `4`.
