The input values are `n = 1`, `a = 25`, `b = 25`, and `c = 50`. These values are used to calculate the probability of winning a game with certain conditions.

First, the code calculates the inverse of 100 modulo `M = 1000000007` using the `modinv` function. This is used to convert percentages into probabilities (as fractions of 1) for easier calculations in modulo arithmetic.

The probabilities `a`, `b`, and `c` are then converted into probabilities `a2`, `b2`, and `c` by multiplying them with `inv100` and taking modulo `M`. The values `na` and `nb` are also calculated as `100 - a` and `100 - b` respectively, and then converted into probabilities in the same way.

An array `fa` is created to store factorials, and `fai` to store factorial inverses, both up to `2 * n`. These are used later for calculating combinations.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 to store the final answer.

The code then calculates a scaling factor `scale` which is the modular inverse of `(a + b) % M`. This is used to normalize the probabilities `a` and `b` to only consider the cases where either player A or B wins (ignoring the probability of a draw).

The probabilities `a2` and `b2` are then calculated by multiplying `a` and `b` with `scale` and taking modulo `M`.

A loop runs from `k = n` to `k < 2 * n`, calculating the probabilities of player A winning after exactly `k` rounds and player B winning after exactly `k` rounds, using the `modpow` and `modcomb` functions to calculate the respective probabilities.

The calculated probabilities `ak` and `bk` are then multiplied by `k` and added to `ans`, taking modulo `M` after each addition.

Finally, `ans` is multiplied by the modular inverse of `(a + b) % M` to account for the scaling factor applied earlier, and the result is printed.

Given the input values, the loop will run only once with `k = n = 1`. Since `a = b = 25`, the probabilities `a2` and `b2` will be equal. The combination function `modcomb(k - 1, n - 1, fa, fai, M)` will return 1 since `k - 1 = n - 1 = 0`. Therefore, `ak` and `bk` will be equal, and `ans` will be `2 * ak * k % M`.

The output will be the final value of `ans` after the above calculations.
