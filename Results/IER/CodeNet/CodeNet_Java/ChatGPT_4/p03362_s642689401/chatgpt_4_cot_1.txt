<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `5`, which means we need to find the first 5 prime numbers that give a remainder of 1 when divided by 5.

The `Prime` class is used to generate prime numbers. It starts with a list containing 2 and 3, and a `last` variable set to 3. The `isPrime` method checks if a number is prime, and the `nextPrime` method finds the next prime number after the last one found.

The `main` method creates an instance of `Prime` and enters an infinite loop. In each iteration, it calls `nextPrime` to get the next prime number. If the prime number modulo 5 equals 1, it is printed, and the count is incremented. If the count reaches the input number `n`, which is 5 in this case, the loop breaks.

The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and so on. We are interested in those that give a remainder of 1 when divided by 5. These are 11, 31, 41, 61, 71, etc.

The output will be the first 5 of these numbers, separated by spaces.

Let's find the first 5 such prime numbers:
- 11 % 5 = 1 (count = 1)
- 31 % 5 = 1 (count = 2)
- 41 % 5 = 1 (count = 3)
- 61 % 5 = 1 (count = 4)
- 71 % 5 = 1 (count = 5)

Once the count reaches 5, the loop breaks, and the program ends without printing a trailing space after the last number.

11 31 41 61 71
