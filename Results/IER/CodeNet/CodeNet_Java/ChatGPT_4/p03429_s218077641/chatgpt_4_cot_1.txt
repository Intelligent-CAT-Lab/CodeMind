<<<Analysis>>>
The input `3 4 4 2` initializes the variables n, m, a, and b with 3, 4, 4, and 2 respectively. The code then creates a 3x4 map (array) filled with '.' characters.

The code first checks if m is odd, which it is (m = 4). Since m is not odd, the corresponding if block is not executed.

Next, the code checks if n is odd, which it is (n = 3). Since n is odd, the corresponding if block is executed. It fills the bottom row of the map with alternating '<' and '>' characters, decrementing a by 1 for each pair added. After this loop, a is reduced from 4 to 2, and the bottom row of the map looks like this: ".<>.<>".

Then, the code enters a nested for loop to fill the rest of the map. It iterates over the map in steps of 2, starting from index 1, which effectively targets every other cell starting from the second row and second column. The conditions inside the loop check if there are enough a or b values to place pairs of '<', '>', '^', or 'v' characters. Since a is 2 and b is 2, the following changes are made to the map:
- Two '<' and '>' pairs are placed, reducing a to 0.
- One '^' and 'v' pair is placed, reducing b to 0.

After the nested for loop, the map looks like this:
```
.^.^
<v<v
.<>.<>
```

Finally, the code checks if both a and b are 0, which they are. Since both are 0, the code prints "YES" and the map as it is.

<<<Output>>>
YES
.^.^
<v<v
.<>.<>
