<<<Analysis>>>
The input "125" is read as a string and passed to the dfs (depth-first search) function. The dfs function is designed to calculate all possible sums by inserting a '+' at any position between the digits of the string.

The dfs function works as follows:
- It takes four parameters: leftNum (the current number being formed), sum (the current sum of numbers), depth (the current position in the string), and s (the input string).
- It calculates the numeric value of the current character in the string (nowCharNum).
- If the depth is at the last character of the string, it returns the sum of the current sum and the current number being formed (leftNum * 10 + nowCharNum).
- Otherwise, it makes two recursive calls:
  - One without adding a '+', which means it continues to form the current number (leftNum * 10 + nowCharNum).
  - One with adding a '+', which means it adds the current number to the sum and resets leftNum to start forming a new number from the next character.

For the input "125", the dfs function will explore all possible ways to insert '+' into the string:
- "125" (no addition) = 125
- "1+25" = 1 + 25 = 26
- "12+5" = 12 + 5 = 17
- "1+2+5" = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8

The dfs function will sum all these possibilities to get the final result.

Let's calculate the sum:
125 (no addition)
+ 26 (1+25)
+ 17 (12+5)
+ 8 (1+2+5)
-----
= 176

The output will be the sum of all these values, which is 176.
