The code defines a class `Main` with a method `solve()` that calculates how many times a number `x` can be doubled (multiplied by 2) before it exceeds another number `y`. The `solve()` method reads two long integers `x` and `y` from the input, which are 3 and 20 respectively in this case.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. A for loop starts with `i` equal to `x` (which is 3) and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `y` (which is 20). In each iteration, `i` is multiplied by 2, and `ans` is incremented by 1.

The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: `i` is 3, which is less than 20, so `ans` becomes 1.
- Second iteration: `i` is doubled to 6, which is still less than 20, so `ans` becomes 2.
- Third iteration: `i` is doubled to 12, which is still less than 20, so `ans` becomes 3.
- Fourth iteration: `i` is doubled to 24, which is now greater than 20, so the loop stops.

The final value of `ans` is 3, which is the number of times 3 can be doubled without exceeding 20.

The `solve()` method then prints the value of `ans` using `out.println(ans);`. The `out` object is a `PrintWriter` that writes to `System.out`, and `out.flush()` ensures that the output is sent to `System.out`.

Therefore, the output of the code execution will be 3.
