<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "ABC". The main method calls the dfs method with this string.

The dfs method first checks if the input string is equal to "ABC". If it is, it returns true. Since the input string is indeed "ABC", the condition is met and the method returns true immediately.

The main method then receives this true value and prints "Yes" as the output because the ternary operator `(dfs(s) ? "Yes" : "No")` evaluates to "Yes" when the dfs method returns true.

No other part of the dfs method is executed because the return statement is reached before any further processing.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
