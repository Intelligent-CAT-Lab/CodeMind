The variable X is initialized with 10 according to the input. The code then checks if X is 1, 2, or 3, and if so, it would print 1. However, since X is 10, it does not satisfy this condition.

The code then initializes an array of size 1000 with all elements set to 0. It also initializes two variables, a and i, with values 1 and 2, respectively.

The code enters a while loop that will continue until the condition `a > X` is met. Inside the loop, the variable a is set to the square of i (i.e., `i * i`). If a is greater than X, the loop breaks. Otherwise, it enters another for loop that starts with j equal to a and continues as long as j is less than or equal to X, multiplying j by i in each iteration.

For each iteration of the inner for loop, the current value of j is stored in the array at the current index, and the index is incremented.

After the outer while loop is exited, the array is sorted in parallel using `Arrays.parallelSort(array)`.

Finally, the code prints the last element of the sorted array, which is at index 999.

Let's go through the loop iterations for X = 10:

- i = 2, a = 4 (2^2), j = 4 (since 4 <= 10, store 4 in array, index = 0)
- i = 2, a = 4, j = 8 (since 8 <= 10, store 8 in array, index = 1)
- i = 3, a = 9 (3^2), j = 9 (since 9 <= 10, store 9 in array, index = 2)
- i = 4, a = 16 (4^2), loop breaks because a > X

The array now has the values [4, 8, 9, 0, 0, ..., 0] with the rest being zeros. After sorting, the last non-zero value will be at the end of the array before the zeros.

The sorted array will look like [0, 0, ..., 0, 4, 8, 9], and the last element (index 999) will be 9.

Therefore, the output will be 9.
