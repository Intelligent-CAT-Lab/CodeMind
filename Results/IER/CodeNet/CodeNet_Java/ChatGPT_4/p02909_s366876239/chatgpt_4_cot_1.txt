<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads a single word from the input and assigns it to the variable `today`.

The input provided is "Sunny".

The code then checks the value of `today` using a series of if-else statements:
- If `today` is equal to "Sunny", it prints "Cloudy".
- Else if `today` is equal to "Cloudy", it prints "Rainy".
- Otherwise, it prints "Sunny".

Since the input is "Sunny", the first condition is met, and the code will print "Cloudy".
<<<Output>>>
Cloudy
