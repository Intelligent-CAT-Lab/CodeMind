<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `4`. The main method initializes an InputReader and an OutputWriter, and then creates an instance of TaskD to solve the problem.

In the solve method of TaskD, the input `4` is read and stored in variable `l`. The value of `l` is then decremented by 1, resulting in `l = 3`.

The variables `cnum`, `cval`, `m`, and `n` are initialized with values `3`, `1`, `0`, and `2` respectively.

A while loop starts with the condition `cnum > 0`. Inside the loop, `cnum` is decremented by `cval`. The condition `cval * 2 <= cnum` is checked, and if true, `cval` is doubled and `n` is incremented. This loop continues until `cval` can no longer be doubled without exceeding `cnum`. In this case, the loop runs only once and breaks immediately because `cval * 2` is not less than or equal to `cnum` after the first iteration. Thus, `n` remains `2`.

An ArrayList `ans` is created to store the answers. Two variables `cn` and `nn` are initialized with values `1` and `2`.

A for loop starts with `i = cval` and continues while `i >= 1`, halving `i` each iteration. Inside the loop, two strings are added to `ans` with the format "cn nn i" and "cn nn 0", and `m` is incremented by 2 each time. The loop runs only once because `cval` is `1`. After the loop, `cn` and `nn` are incremented to `2` and `3`.

The variable `lv` is initialized with `2 * cval - 1`, which is `1`.

Another while loop starts with the condition `lv < l`. Inside the loop, `nlv` is set to `lv + 1`, and a nested while loop calculates the values of `i` and `j` such that `2 * j - 1 + nlv <= l`. The nested loop runs until this condition is false, halving `j` each time. After the nested loop, `j` is halved one last time. A string is added to `ans` with the format "1 i nlv", and `m` is incremented by 1. The value of `lv` is updated based on the value of `j`. This loop runs only once because after the first iteration, `lv` becomes `3`, which is not less than `l`.

Finally, the OutputWriter prints the values of `n` and `m`, followed by each string in `ans`.

The final output will be the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the strings stored in `ans`. The value of `n` is `2`, and the value of `m` is `3` (2 from the first for loop and 1 from the second while loop). The strings in `ans` are "1 2 1", "1 2 0", and "1 2 2".
