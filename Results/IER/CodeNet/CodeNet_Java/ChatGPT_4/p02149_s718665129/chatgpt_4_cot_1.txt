<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized with 1000, 900, and 850 respectively according to the input.
The code then enters a series of conditional checks:
1. It first checks if a < b, which is false because 1000 is not less than 900.
2. Since the first condition is false, it goes to the else-if part and checks if a < c, which is also false because 1000 is not less than 850.
3. Since none of the previous conditions are met, it goes to the final else part and prints "A".
<<<Output>>>
A
