<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "0011" is converted to a character array s with the elements {'0', '0', '1', '1'}.
The variable numZeros is initialized with 0.
The program enters a for-each loop to count the number of '0' characters in the array s.
It finds two '0' characters, so numZeros is incremented twice, resulting in numZeros being 2.
After the loop, the program calculates the minimum of numZeros and the length of s minus numZeros, which is min(2, 4 - 2) = min(2, 2) = 2.
This minimum value is then multiplied by 2, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4.
The program prints the result, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
