<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object. The first integer is assigned to the left side of the comparison (<=) and the second integer to the right side.

The code compares the two integers using the less than or equal to (<=) operator. If the first integer is less than or equal to the second integer, it prints "unsafe". Otherwise, it prints "safe".

Given the input "4 5", the first integer (4) is less than the second integer (5), so the condition (4 <= 5) is true. Therefore, the code will print "unsafe".
<<<Output>>>
