The input provided initializes the variables W, H, and C with 10, 20, and 5, respectively. The gcd function is called with W and H as arguments to calculate the greatest common divisor of W and H.

The gcd function works as follows:
- gcd(10, 20): Since 20 is not 0, it calls gcd(20, 10 % 20).
- gcd(20, 10 % 20): 10 % 20 is 10, so it calls gcd(10, 20 % 10).
- gcd(10, 20 % 10): 20 % 10 is 0, so it returns 10.

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 20 is 10. The variable WH is set to this GCD value, which is 10.

Next, the code calculates the value of a as (W/WH)*(H/WH), which is (10/10)*(20/10) = 1*2 = 2.

Finally, the code prints the value of a multiplied by C, which is 2*5 = 10.

<<<Output>>>
10
