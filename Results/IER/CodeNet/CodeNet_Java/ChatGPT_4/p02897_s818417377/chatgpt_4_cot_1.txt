<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a single integer `4`. The `solve` method is called, which reads this integer using the `FastReader` class and stores it in the variable `n`.

The variable `odds` is calculated as follows:
- Since `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), `odds` is set to `n / 2`, which is `4 / 2 = 2`.

The output is calculated by dividing `odds` by `n` and printing the result as a double:
- The result is `(double) 2 / (double) 4`, which simplifies to `0.5`.

The `out.println` method is used to print the result, and then `out.flush()` ensures that the output is actually written out.
