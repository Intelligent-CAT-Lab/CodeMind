<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two variables, max and idx, with 0. It then enters a for loop that iterates three times, corresponding to the three integers in the input.

During each iteration, the code reads an integer from the input using Scanner's nextInt() method. The input provided is `1000 900 850`.

In the first iteration (i = 0), x is assigned the value 1000. Since max (0) is less than x (1000), max is updated to 1000 and idx is updated to 0.

In the second iteration (i = 1), x is assigned the value 900. Since max (1000) is not less than x (900), max and idx remain unchanged.

In the third iteration (i = 2), x is assigned the value 850. Since max (1000) is not less than x (850), max and idx remain unchanged.

After the loop, the code prints the character corresponding to 'A' + idx. Since idx is 0, the character printed will be 'A' + 0, which is 'A'.
