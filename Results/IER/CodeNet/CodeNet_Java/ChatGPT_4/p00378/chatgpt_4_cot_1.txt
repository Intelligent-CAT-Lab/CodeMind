<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and X are initialized with 180, 100, and 2400 respectively according to the input.

The first if statement checks if X is not a multiple of 500. Since 2400 is a multiple of 500, the condition is false, and the code inside the if block is not executed.

Next, the code checks the relationship between A and B:
- Since A (180) is not less than B (100), the first if condition is false.
- Since A (180) is not greater than 2 times B (2*100=200), the else if condition is also false.

Therefore, the else block is executed:
- a is assigned the value of X divided by 1000, which is 2400/1000 = 2.
- X is assigned the remainder of X divided by 1000, which is 2400%1000 = 400.
- b is assigned the value of X divided by 500, which is 400/500 = 0 (since we are dealing with integer division).

Finally, the program prints the result of A*a + B*b, which is 180*2 + 100*0 = 360 + 0 = 360.

<<<Output>>>
360
