<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "125" is read and stored in variable S. The length of S is 3, so n is set to 2. The program then enters a for loop that will iterate 2^2 (or 4) times, corresponding to all possible ways to insert "+" into the string "125" between the digits.

The loop variable i will take on the values 0, 1, 2, and 3 during the iterations. For each value of i, the program will attempt to insert "+" at different positions in the string based on the binary representation of i.

- When i is 0 (binary 00), no "+" is inserted, and the string remains "125". The sum res is increased by 125.
- When i is 1 (binary 01), a "+" is inserted after the second digit, resulting in the string "12+5". The sum res is increased by 12 + 5 = 17.
- When i is 2 (binary 10), a "+" is inserted after the first digit, resulting in the string "1+25". The sum res is increased by 1 + 25 = 26.
- When i is 3 (binary 11), a "+" is inserted after the first and second digits, resulting in the string "1+2+5". The sum res is increased by 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.

The final result is the sum of all these values: 125 + 17 + 26 + 8 = 176.
