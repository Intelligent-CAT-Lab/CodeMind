<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "abac". The code initializes three counters cnta, cntb, and cntc to count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' respectively in the input string.

The for loop iterates over each character in the input string:
- For the first character 'a', cnta is incremented to 1.
- For the second character 'b', cntb is incremented to 1.
- For the third character 'a', cnta is incremented to 2.
- For the fourth character 'c', cntc is incremented to 1.

After the loop, the counts are as follows:
cnta = 2 (for 'a')
cntb = 1 (for 'b')
cntc = 1 (for 'c')

The code then checks if the absolute difference between any two counts is greater than 1. In this case:
- |cnta - cntb| = |2 - 1| = 1
- |cntb - cntc| = |1 - 1| = 0
- |cntc - cnta| = |1 - 2| = 1

None of these differences are greater than 1, so the condition for printing "NO" is not met. Therefore, the code will print "YES".

<<<Output>>>
YES
