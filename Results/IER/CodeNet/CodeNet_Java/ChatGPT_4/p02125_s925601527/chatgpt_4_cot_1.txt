<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the value 2 according to the input.
The variable binaryNumDigits is calculated by converting N to its binary representation and getting the length of that binary string. For N = 2, the binary representation is "10", so binaryNumDigits is 2.
The ternary operator checks if N is equal to 2^binaryNumDigits - 1. For N = 2, this is not the case because 2^2 - 1 equals 3, not 2.
Since the condition is false, the ternary operator assigns binaryNumDigits - 1 to ans, which is 2 - 1 = 1.
The program then prints the value of ans, which is 1.
