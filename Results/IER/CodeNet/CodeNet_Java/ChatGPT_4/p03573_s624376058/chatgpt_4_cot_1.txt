<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads three integers A, B, and C from the input, which are 5, 7, and 5 respectively according to the given input.

The code then checks if A is equal to B. Since A is 5 and B is 7, this condition is false.

Next, it checks if A is equal to C. Since A is 5 and C is also 5, this condition is true.

Because the second condition is true, the code executes the corresponding block and prints the value of B, which is 7.

The code does not check the last else block because one of the previous conditions has already been met and executed.

Therefore, the output will be the value of B, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
