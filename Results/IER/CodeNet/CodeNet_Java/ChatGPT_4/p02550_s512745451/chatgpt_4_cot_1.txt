<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `6 2 1001`, which corresponds to `n`, `x`, and `m` respectively. The code is designed to compute a sum based on a sequence of numbers generated by the formula `num = (prev*prev)%m`, starting with `prev = x`.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the code:

1. The variables `n`, `x`, and `m` are initialized with the values 6, 2, and 1001.
2. An ArrayList `ar` and a HashMap `hash` are created to store the sequence and the indices of the numbers.
3. The first number of the sequence is added to `ar` and `hash`, which is `x` itself (2 in this case).
4. The variable `prev` is set to `x`, `index` and `index1` are initialized to -1, and `sum` is initialized to `x`.
5. A for loop starts to generate the sequence for `i` from 2 to `n` (6).
6. Inside the loop, `num` is calculated as `(prev*prev)%m`. For the first iteration, `num` is `(2*2)%1001 = 4`.
7. The code checks if `num` is already in `hash`. If it is, it means a cycle is detected, and it sets `index` and `index1` to the appropriate values and breaks the loop. If not, it adds `num` to `hash` and `ar`, and updates `sum` and `prev`.
8. This process continues until a cycle is detected or all numbers are generated.
9. If no cycle is detected (`index` remains -1), the code prints the sum of the sequence.
10. If a cycle is detected, the code calculates the sum of the sequence considering the cycle to avoid redundant calculations.

Let's calculate the sequence and the sum:
- i=1: num = 2 (initial value), sum = 2
- i=2: num = (2*2)%1001 = 4, sum = 2 + 4 = 6
- i=3: num = (4*4)%1001 = 16, sum = 6 + 16 = 22
- i=4: num = (16*16)%1001 = 256, sum = 22 + 256 = 278
- i=5: num = (256*256)%1001 = 16 (cycle detected, index = 3, index1 = 5), sum = 278 + 16 = 294
- i=6: Since a cycle is detected, the loop breaks, and the code calculates the sum considering the cycle.

The cycle length is `index1 - index = 5 - 3 = 2`. The remaining iterations after the cycle is detected is `rem = n - index + 1 = 6 - 3 + 1 = 4`. The number of full cycles is `count = rem / (index1 - index) = 4 / 2 = 2`. The sum is updated to `sum = sum + ((count - 1) * remsum)`, where `remsum = sum - tmp` (sum of numbers before the cycle starts). Since `tmp` is the sum of the first two numbers (2 and 4), `tmp = 6`, and `remsum = 294 - 6 = 288`. The sum is updated to `sum = 294 + ((2 - 1) * 288) = 294 + 288 = 582`.

The remaining iterations after full cycles are `extrarem = rem % (index1 - index) = 4 % 2 = 0`, so no additional numbers are added to the sum.

The final sum is 582.
