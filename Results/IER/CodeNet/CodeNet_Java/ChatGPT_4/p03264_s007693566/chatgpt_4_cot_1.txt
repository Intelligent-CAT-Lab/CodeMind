<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads an integer value into the variable k, which is assigned the value 3 according to the input.

The code checks if k is an even number by using the modulus operator (k % 2). Since 3 is not an even number, the condition (k % 2 == 0) evaluates to false, and the else block is executed.

In the else block, the code calculates the product of (k/2 + 1) and (k/2). Since integer division is used, k/2 evaluates to 1 (because 3/2 is 1.5, but the decimal part is discarded). Therefore, the expression becomes (1 + 1) * 1, which simplifies to 2 * 1.

The result of the expression is 2, which is then printed to the console.

<<<Output>>>
