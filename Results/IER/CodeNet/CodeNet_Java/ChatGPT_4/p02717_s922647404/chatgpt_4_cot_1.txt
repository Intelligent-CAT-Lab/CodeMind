<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads three integers X, Y, and Z from the input, which are provided as `1 2 3`. The values are assigned as follows:
- X is assigned the value 1
- Y is assigned the value 2
- Z is assigned the value 3

The code then prints the values of Z, X, and Y in that order, separated by spaces. Since Z is 3, X is 1, and Y is 2, the output will be "3 1 2".
<<<Output>>>
3 1 2
