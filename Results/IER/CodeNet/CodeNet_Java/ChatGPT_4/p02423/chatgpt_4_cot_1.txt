<<<Analysis>>>
The input is the number 8. The program first converts this number into a binary string using `Long.toBinaryString(x)`, which results in "1000". Then it performs a left shift (`x<<1`) and a right shift (`x>>1`) on the number, converting these results to binary strings as well. The left shift of 8 (which is "1000" in binary) results in "10000" (16 in decimal), and the right shift results in "100" (4 in decimal).

The `to32` method is then called on each of these binary strings to ensure they are 32 characters long, padding with zeros on the left if necessary. Since "1000" is only 4 characters long, it will be padded with 28 leading zeros to become "0000000000000000000000001000". The same happens with "10000" and "100", resulting in "0000000000000000000000010000" and "0000000000000000000000000100" respectively.

After that, the program prints the 32-bit binary string of the original number (8), which is "0000000000000000000000001000". Then it prints the complement of this binary string by replacing each '0' with '1' and each '1' with '0', resulting in "1111111111111111111111110111".

Finally, it prints the 32-bit binary strings of the left and right shifted numbers, which are "0000000000000000000000010000" and "0000000000000000000000000100" respectively.
