<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads three strings, s1, s2, and s3, from the input, which are "atcoder", "beginner", and "contest" respectively.

The `substring` method is used to extract the first character (at index 0) from each of these strings. The `toUpperCase` method is then called on these substrings to convert them to uppercase.

Finally, the code concatenates these uppercase characters and prints the result. The first character of "atcoder" is 'a', which is converted to 'A'. The first character of "beginner" is 'b', which is converted to 'B'. The first character of "contest" is 'c', which is converted to 'C'.

The output will be the concatenation of 'A', 'B', and 'C', which is "ABC".
