<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to create a flag pattern based on the input dimensions and a character to place in the center. The input `3 3 B` initializes W (width) to 3, H (height) to 3, and c (character) to 'B'.

The code uses nested for loops to iterate over each position in a grid of size H x W. It uses a StringBuilder to construct the flag pattern line by line.

- For the first and last row (i == 0 or i == H - 1), it places '+' at the corners (j == 0 or j == W - 1) and '-' in between.
- For the first and last column (j == 0 or j == W - 1) of the middle rows, it places '|'.
- For the center position (i == H / 2 and j == W / 2), it places the character 'B'. Since both H and W are 3, H / 2 and W / 2 both evaluate to 1 (integer division).
- For all other positions, it places '.'.

After constructing the pattern, it prints the StringBuilder's content.

The expected output for the input `3 3 B` will be a 3x3 grid with '+' at the corners, '-' and '|' as borders, and 'B' in the center, with '.' filling the rest.
