<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, x1 and x2, from the input which are 20 and 30 respectively according to the given input.

The code then calculates the absolute difference between x1 and x2 using the Math.abs() method. The absolute difference between 20 and 30 is 10.

Finally, the code prints the result of the Math.abs() method call, which is the absolute difference between the two numbers.

<<<Output>>>
10
