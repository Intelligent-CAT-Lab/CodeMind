<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, n and k, from the input. According to the given input, n is assigned the value 3 and k is assigned the value 2.

The code then calculates the expression (n - k + 1), which is (3 - 2 + 1) in this case, and prints the result to the standard output.

The calculation is straightforward:
3 (value of n) - 2 (value of k) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, the output will be the result of this calculation, which is 2.
