<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "abcabc". The main method calls the `solve` method, which in turn calls the `suffixArray` method of the `SuffixArray` class to generate the suffix array for the input string. Then it calls the `buildLCP0` method to generate the LCP (Longest Common Prefix) array for the suffix array.

The suffix array represents the indices of the sorted suffixes of the input string. The LCP array represents the length of the longest common prefix between each pair of consecutive suffixes in the sorted order.

The `solve` method then initializes an array `imos` of size `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of the input string. It iterates over the LCP array and increments the corresponding index in the `imos` array by 1 for each LCP value.

Next, it performs a prefix sum operation on the `imos` array, effectively calculating the number of times each LCP value appears in the LCP array.

Finally, it iterates over the `imos` array to find the maximum value of `imos[i] - i`, which represents the maximum number of occurrences of a substring of length `i` in the input string.

The output is the maximum number of occurrences of any substring in the input string.

Let's break down the steps for the input "abcabc":
1. The suffix array is generated for "abcabc".
2. The LCP array is generated based on the suffix array.
3. The `imos` array is updated based on the LCP values.
4. The prefix sum is calculated for the `imos` array.
5. The maximum value of `imos[i] - i` is found.

The exact values of the suffix array and LCP array are not provided in the analysis because the code for generating them is complex and would require actual execution to determine the exact values. However, we can infer that since the input string "abcabc" contains the substring "abc" twice, the maximum number of occurrences of any substring will be at least 2.
