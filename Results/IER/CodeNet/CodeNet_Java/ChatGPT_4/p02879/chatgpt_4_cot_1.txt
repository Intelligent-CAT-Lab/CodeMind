<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a new instance of the Main class and calls the solve method on it. Inside the solve method, it creates a Scanner object that wraps a BufferedReader, which in turn wraps an InputStreamReader that reads from the standard input (System.in).

The Scanner object is used to read two integers, A and B, from the input. The input provided is "2 5", so A is assigned the value 2 and B is assigned the value 5.

The code then checks if either A or B is greater than 9. Since both A and B are less than 9, the condition (9 < A || 9 < B) evaluates to false, and the code does not enter the if block that prints -1 and returns.

Instead, it proceeds to the next line after the if block, which calculates the product of A and B (2 * 5) and prints the result.

Therefore, the output will be the product of 2 and 5, which is 10.
