<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "aab". The `main` method calls the `run` method, which in turn calls the `solver` method with the input string converted to a character array.

The `solver` method first checks if the length of the string is 1, which it is not. Then it checks if the Z-algorithm applied to the string from the second character onwards results in the length of the string minus one, which would mean the string is made up of repeating characters. This is also not the case for "aab".

The method then initializes two boolean arrays `ok1` and `ok2` of length `n` (the length of the string) and fills them with `true`, except for the first element which is set to `false`. These arrays are used to keep track of which indices are "ok" based on the Z-algorithm results for the string and its reverse.

The method then iterates over all divisors of `n` and checks if the Z-algorithm result for that divisor is equal to `n - divisor`. If it is, `tmp` is incremented. Since "aab" has no divisors other than 1 and itself, and the Z-algorithm does not return `n - divisor` for any divisor, `tmp` remains 0.

Next, the method iterates over all indices `d` from 1 to `n - 1` and marks indices in `ok1` and `ok2` as `false` if certain conditions based on the Z-algorithm results are met. However, for the string "aab", none of these conditions are met, so `ok1` and `ok2` remain unchanged.

Finally, the method counts how many indices `i` from 1 to `n - 1` are "ok" in both `ok1` and `ok2`. In this case, since `ok1` and `ok2` are unchanged and all true except for the first element, the count `ret` will be `n - 2`, which is 1 for the string "aab".

The `solver` method returns an array with 2 as the first element and `ret` as the second element. The `run` method then prints these two numbers on separate lines.
