<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `13`. The code starts by reading this integer and assigning it to the variable `n`. It then goes through a series of if-else statements to determine what to print based on the value of `n`.

The first condition checks if `n` is less than or equal to 9, which is not the case for 13. The next condition checks if `n` is exactly 10, which is also not the case. The subsequent condition checks if `n` is less than or equal to 16, which is true for 13.

Since the condition `n <= 16` is met, the code will execute the corresponding block, which prints the number `11`. No other conditions will be checked after this point because the else-if structure ensures only one block is executed.

Therefore, the output will be `11`.
