<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that creates an instance of `InputReader` and `PrintWriter`, and then creates an instance of `Solver` to solve a problem. The `solve` method in the `Solver` class is called once, as `test_cases` is set to 1.

The `solve` method reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input. These are set to 0, 75, 25, and 100 respectively according to the input provided.

The `solve` method then initializes an integer `ans` to 0 and enters a for loop that iterates from `a` to `b` (from 0 to 75). For each integer `i` in this range, it checks if `i` is between `c` and `d` (between 25 and 100). If `i` is within this range, it increments `ans` by 1.

After the loop, if `ans` is greater than 0, it decrements `ans` by 1. This is because the loop counts the number of integers that are both greater than or equal to `c` and less than or equal to `d`, but the problem seems to require counting the numbers strictly between `c` and `d`.

The range from `a` to `b` is 0 to 75, and the range from `c` to `d` is 25 to 100. The overlapping range is from 25 to 75. There are 51 numbers in this range (including both 25 and 75). Since the problem seems to require the count of numbers strictly between `c` and `d`, the final answer should be 51 - 1 = 50.

Finally, the `solve` method prints the value of `ans` to the output.
