<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3`. The variable n is initialized with the value 3. The variables a and b are initialized with 0.

The code checks if n is even by using the condition `n % 2 == 0`. Since 3 is not even (3 % 2 equals 1), the else block is executed.

In the else block, a is assigned the value of `n/2 + 1`, which is `3/2 + 1` equals `1 + 1` equals `2`. The variable b is assigned the value of `n/2`, which is `3/2` equals `1` (since we are dealing with integer division, the decimal part is discarded).

The code then prints the product of a and b, which is `2 * 1` equals `2`.

Finally, the scanner's reader is closed, and the output stream is closed as well.
