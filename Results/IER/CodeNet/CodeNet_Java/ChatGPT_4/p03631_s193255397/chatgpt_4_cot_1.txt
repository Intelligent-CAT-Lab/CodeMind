The input "575" is read as a string and stored in the variable str. The variable num1 is initialized with the integer value of the input string, which is 575.
The variable a is initialized with the integer value of the first character of the input string, which is '5'. Therefore, a is 5.
The variable b is initialized with the integer value of the second character of the input string, which is '7'. Therefore, b is 7.
The variable c is initialized with the integer value of the third character of the input string, which is '5'. Therefore, c is 5.
The variable num2 is calculated as 100*c + 10*b + a, which is 100*5 + 10*7 + 5 = 500 + 70 + 5 = 575.
The if statement checks if num1 is equal to num2. Since both num1 and num2 are 575, the condition is true.
Because the condition is true, "Yes" is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
