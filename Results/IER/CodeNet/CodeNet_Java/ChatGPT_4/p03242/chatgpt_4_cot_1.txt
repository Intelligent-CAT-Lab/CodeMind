<<<Analysis>>>
The input "119" is read and converted to a character array S = {'1', '1', '9'}.
The for loop iterates over the first three elements of the array S.
During the first iteration (i = 0), S[0] is '1', so it is changed to '9'.
During the second iteration (i = 1), S[1] is '1', so it is also changed to '9'.
During the third iteration (i = 2), S[2] is '9', so it is changed to '1'.
The modified character array S now contains {'9', '9', '1'}.
The program then prints the character array as a string, which will output "991".
<<<Output>>>
991
