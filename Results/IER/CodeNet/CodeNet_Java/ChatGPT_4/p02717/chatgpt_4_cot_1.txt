<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads three integers a, b, and c in that order from the input provided by the user. According to the input `1 2 3`, the variables a, b, and c are assigned the values 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The code then prints the values of c, a, and b in that order, separated by spaces. Therefore, the output will be "3 1 2".
<<<Output>>>
3 1 2
