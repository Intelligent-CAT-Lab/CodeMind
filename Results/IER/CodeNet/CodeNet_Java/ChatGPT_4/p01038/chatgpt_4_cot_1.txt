The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input. The array `heights` is then filled with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 3.

The `signed` ArrayList is used to store the sign of the difference between consecutive heights. The `prev` variable is initialized with the minimum integer value.

The for loop from 0 to 3 (N - 1) calculates the difference between consecutive heights and determines the sign of this difference (1 for positive, -1 for negative, 0 for no difference). The first difference is between 2 and 1, which is positive, so `prev` is set to 1. The loop continues and the differences are 1 (positive), 1 (positive), and -1 (negative). The sign changes from positive to negative between the last two heights, so 1 is added to the `signed` ArrayList.

After the loop, since `prev` is not the minimum integer value, the last sign (-1) is added to the `signed` ArrayList. The `signed` ArrayList now contains [1, -1].

The `counts` array is used to count specific patterns in the `signed` ArrayList. The first for loop is skipped because `signed.size()` is 2, which is not greater than 1.

The second for loop iterates over the `signed` ArrayList to count the number of times the sign changes from positive to negative and vice versa. There is one change from positive to negative, so `counts[3]` is incremented by 1. There are no changes from negative to positive, so `counts[4]` remains 0.

Finally, the `counts` array is printed, which contains [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].
