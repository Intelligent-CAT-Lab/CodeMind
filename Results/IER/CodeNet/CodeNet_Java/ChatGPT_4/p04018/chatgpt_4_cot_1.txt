<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to read a string and perform some operations using the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm to find certain patterns within the string. The input string is `aab`.

1. The `main` method initializes a `FastIO` object for input and output and a `Task` object which contains the logic to solve the problem.
2. The `Task` object's `run` method is called, which in turn calls the `solve` method.
3. The `solve` method reads the string into a character array `s` and determines its length `n`, which is 3 for the input `aab`.
4. Two `KMPAutomaton` objects are created, `kmp` and `inv`, for the original string and its inverse, respectively.
5. The `KMPAutomaton` objects are built using the characters of the string and its inverse.
6. The period `p` of the string is calculated using the `fail` array of the `kmp` object. The period is the length of the string minus the last value in the `fail` array.
7. If the length of the string `n` is not divisible by `p`, then `p` is set to `n`.
8. If `p` is 1, the answer is `n, 1`, which means the string is composed of one repeating character.
9. If `p` is equal to `n`, the answer is `1, 1`, which means the string is aperiodic.
10. Otherwise, the code counts the number of substrings of length 2 that are aperiodic and do not contain a smaller period within themselves.
11. The `answer` method is called with the length of the substring and the count of such substrings, which appends the result to the `FastIO` object's cache.
12. Finally, the `FastIO` object's `flush` method is called to output the result.

For the input `aab`, the period `p` is calculated as follows:
- The `fail` array for `kmp` is built as [-1, 0, 1], so `p = 3 - 1 = 2`.
- Since `n % p` is 1, `p` remains 2.
- The loop checks for aperiodic substrings of length 2, but since `p` is 2 and `n` is 3, there are no such substrings.
- Therefore, the answer is `1, 1`.
