The input `2 3 1 1` initializes the variables h, w, a, and b with the values 2, 3, 1, and 1 respectively.

The `BinomialCalculator` is initialized with n = h + w = 5 and mod = 1e9 + 7 (MOD7).

The `solve` method in the `TaskD` class calculates the answer by iterating from i = 0 to h - a - 1 (which is 1 in this case, so the loop will iterate for i = 0).

Inside the loop, the following calculation is performed for i = 0:
- `c.c(b - 1 + i, i)` calculates the binomial coefficient C(1 - 1 + 0, 0) which is C(0, 0) = 1.
- `c.c(w - b - 1 + h - i - 1, w - b - 1)` calculates the binomial coefficient C(3 - 1 - 1 + 2 - 0 - 1, 3 - 1 - 1) which is C(2, 1) = 2.
- These two values are multiplied and taken modulo MOD7, resulting in (1 * 2) % MOD7 = 2.

The answer is then taken modulo MOD7, which is still 2 since 2 is less than MOD7.

Finally, the `printLine` method of `OutputWriter` is called to print the answer, which is 2.
