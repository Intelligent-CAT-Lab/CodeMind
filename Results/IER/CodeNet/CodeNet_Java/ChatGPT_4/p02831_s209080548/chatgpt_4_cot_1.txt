<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 3` is read and the variables A and B are initialized with the values 2 and 3 respectively. The gcd function is called with these values, which calculates the greatest common divisor of A and B using the Euclidean algorithm. The gcd of 2 and 3 is 1 since they are coprime.

The solve method then calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of A and B by using the formula LCM(A, B) = A / GCD(A, B) * B. Since the GCD of 2 and 3 is 1, the LCM is simply 2 * 3, which equals 6.

Finally, the LCM value of 6 is printed as the output.

<<<Output>>>
6
