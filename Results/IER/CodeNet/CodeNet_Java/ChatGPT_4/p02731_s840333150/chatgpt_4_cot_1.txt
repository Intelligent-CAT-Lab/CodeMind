<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a double value from the input, which is 3 in this case, and stores it in the variable L. It then calculates the cube of L/3.0, which is the cube of 1.0 (since 3/3.0 equals 1.0). The result of 1.0 cubed is 1.0. The code then formats this result to display with 12 decimal places, which will result in 1.000000000000. Finally, it prints out this formatted string.
<<<Output>>>
1.000000000000
