<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The code then checks the following conditions:
- If both n and m are equal to 1, it prints 1.
- If n is equal to 1 and m is not equal to 1, it prints m-2.
- If m is equal to 1 and n is not equal to 1, it prints n-2.
- Otherwise, it prints the product of (m-2) and (n-2) as a long integer.

Since both n and m are equal to 2, none of the first three conditions are met, so the code executes the else block. It calculates (m-2) * (n-2), which is (2-2) * (2-2) = 0 * 0 = 0.

Therefore, the output of the code will be 0.
