<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two long integers, X and Y, from the input, which are 3 and 4 respectively according to the given input.

The code checks if either X or Y is even by using the modulo operator (%). If either X or Y is divisible by 2 (i.e., the remainder is 0), the condition (X%2==0||Y%2==0) evaluates to true.

In this case, since Y is 4, which is an even number, the condition evaluates to true. Therefore, the code prints "Even" and returns immediately, skipping the remaining part of the code.

If neither X nor Y were even, the code would print "Odd".

Since Y is even in the given input, the output will be "Even".

Even
