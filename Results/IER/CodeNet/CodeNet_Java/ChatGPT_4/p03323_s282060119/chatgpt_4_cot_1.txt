<<<Analysis>>>
The code uses a Scanner object to read integers from the standard input. It enters a while loop that continues as long as there are more integers to read. Inside the loop, it reads two integers, a and b, from the input.

For the given input `5 4`, the variables a and b are initialized with 5 and 4 respectively. The code then checks if both a and b are less than 9 using the condition (a<9&&b<9). Since both 5 and 4 are less than 9, the condition is true.

Because the condition is true, the code prints "Yay!" to the standard output. There are no more integers to read, so the while loop ends and the program terminates.

<<<Output>>>
Yay!
