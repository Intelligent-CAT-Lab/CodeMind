<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two Integer variables, n and m, with the values 2 and 1 respectively, according to the input. Then it initializes an int variable total with 0.
It calculates the value of (n * (n-1) / 2), which is (2 * (2-1) / 2) = (2 * 1 / 2) = 1, and adds it to total.
Next, it calculates the value of (m * (m-1) / 2), which is (1 * (1-1) / 2) = (1 * 0 / 2) = 0, and adds it to total.
The final value of total is 1 + 0 = 1.
The code then prints the value of total, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
