<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized with "RRS". The `solve` method of the `Solver` class is called with this string.

The variable `max` is initialized with 0, and `left` is initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates over each character of the string "RRS".

1. In the first iteration (i=0), the character at index 0 is 'R'. Since 'c' is 'R', `max` is updated to `Math.max(0, 0 - 0 + 1)`, which is 1.
2. In the second iteration (i=1), the character at index 1 is 'R'. Since 'c' is 'R', `max` is updated to `Math.max(1, 1 - 0 + 1)`, which is 2.
3. In the third iteration (i=2), the character at index 2 is 'S'. Since 'c' is not 'R', `left` is updated to `2 + 1`, which is 3.

The loop ends as there are no more characters in the string. The largest value of `max` found was 2, which is the length of the longest continuous sequence of 'R' characters in the string.

The `solve` method returns 2, and this value is printed to the console.
