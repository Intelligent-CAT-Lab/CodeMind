<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer from the input, which is 54 in this case. It then calls the static method `Integer.highestOneBit` with the input value. This method returns an integer that has only the highest-order ("leftmost") one-bit set in the binary representation of the original number, and all other bits cleared.

The binary representation of 54 is `110110`. The highest one-bit in this representation is the bit corresponding to the value 32, which is `100000` in binary. Therefore, the `highestOneBit` method will return 32.

Finally, the code prints the result using `System.out.printf` with a newline character, so the output will be the number 32 followed by a newline.
