<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `2 1 3 4`. The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized with these values respectively.

The sum of these values is calculated and stored in the variable sum, which is 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 10.

Next, three different sums are calculated by subtracting twice the sum of different pairs of the input numbers from the total sum and taking the absolute value:
- s1 = |sum - (a+b)*2| = |10 - (2+1)*2| = |10 - 6| = 4
- s2 = |sum - (a+c)*2| = |10 - (2+3)*2| = |10 - 10| = 0
- s3 = |sum - (a+d)*2| = |10 - (2+4)*2| = |10 - 12| = 2

The minimum of these three values is then calculated:
- min = min(s1, min(s2, s3)) = min(4, min(0, 2)) = min(4, 0) = 0

Finally, the minimum value is printed to the console, which is 0.

The Scanner object is then closed, and the program returns false, although the return value is not used in this context.
