<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `8 6`. The `FastScanner` class reads this input and assigns 8 to `X` and 6 to `Y` in the `Answer` class.

The `solve` method is then called. It first checks if `X` is divisible by `Y` with no remainder. Since 8 % 6 is 2 (not 0), it does not return -1 immediately.

It then enters a for loop starting from `i = 2` and going up to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. In each iteration, it checks if `(X * i) % Y` is not equal to 0. The goal is to find the smallest integer `i` such that `X * i` is not divisible by `Y`.

For `i = 2`, `(8 * 2) % 6` equals `16 % 6`, which is 4 (not 0). Therefore, the condition `(X * i) % Y != 0` is satisfied.

The method returns `X * i`, which is `8 * 2`, equal to 16. This is the output of the `solve` method, and it is printed by the `main` method of the `Answer` class.
