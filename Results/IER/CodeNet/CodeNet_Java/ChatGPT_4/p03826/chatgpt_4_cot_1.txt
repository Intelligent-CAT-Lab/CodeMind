<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to variables a and b as follows:
- a is assigned the product of the first two integers (3 * 5 = 15).
- b is assigned the product of the last two integers (2 * 7 = 14).

After the multiplication, the code compares the two products using a ternary operator:
- If a is less than b, it prints b.
- If a is greater than or equal to b, it prints a.

In this case, since a (15) is greater than b (14), the code will print the value of a.

The Scanner is then closed to prevent resource leaks.

<<<Output>>>
