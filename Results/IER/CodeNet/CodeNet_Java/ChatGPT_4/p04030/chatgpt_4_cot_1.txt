The input string `s` is initialized with "01B0". The string `t` is initialized as an empty string.

The for loop iterates over each character of the input string `s`. The loop has the following conditions:
- If the current character is not 'B', it is appended to the string `t`.
- If the current character is 'B' and `t` is not empty, the last character of `t` is removed.
- If the current character is 'B' and `t` is empty, it continues to the next iteration.

Let's go through the input string "01B0" character by character:
1. '0' is not 'B', so '0' is appended to `t`, making `t` = "0".
2. '1' is not 'B', so '1' is appended to `t`, making `t` = "01".
3. 'B' is 'B', and `t` is not empty, so the last character of `t` is removed, making `t` = "0".
4. '0' is not 'B', so '0' is appended to `t`, making `t` = "00".

After the loop finishes, the final value of `t` is "00", which is printed as the output.
