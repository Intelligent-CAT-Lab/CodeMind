<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input, which are 2 and 2, and assigns them to variables a and b, respectively. It then calculates the expression `a*b - b - a + 1`. Substituting the values of a and b, the expression becomes `2*2 - 2 - 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `4 - 2 - 2 + 1`. This further simplifies to `1`. The result of the calculation is then printed to the console.
