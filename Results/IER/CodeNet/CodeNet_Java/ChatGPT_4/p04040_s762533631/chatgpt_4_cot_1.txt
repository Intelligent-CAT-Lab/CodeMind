The input values are H=2, W=3, A=1, B=1. The `init` method is called with the argument H+W which is 5. Inside the `init` method, the factorial (`fac`), modular multiplicative inverse (`rev`), and factorial of modular multiplicative inverse (`revfac`) arrays are initialized for all numbers from 0 to 5.

The `fac` array is filled with the factorial of the numbers modulo MOD. The `rev` array is filled with the modular multiplicative inverse of the numbers. The `revfac` array is filled with the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of the numbers.

The `pow` method calculates the modular exponentiation. It is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse in the `init` method.

The `comb` method calculates the combination (n choose k) modulo MOD using the precomputed factorial and modular multiplicative inverse arrays.

The main part of the program calculates the variable `ans` by iterating from i=0 to H-A-1, which is 0 to 0 (since H-A is 1). The loop will run only once with i=0.

Inside the loop, the `comb` method is called twice with the following arguments:
1. comb(B+i-1, B-1) which is comb(1+0-1, 1-1) = comb(0, 0) = 1 (since 0 choose 0 is 1).
2. comb(W-B+H-i-2, W-B-1) which is comb(3-1+2-0-2, 3-1-1) = comb(2, 1) = 2 (since 2 choose 1 is 2).

The product of these two combinations is 1 * 2 = 2. This value is then taken modulo MOD, which is still 2 since 2 is less than MOD.

The variable `ans` is updated to 2, and since the loop runs only once, the final value of `ans` is 2.

The program then prints the value of `ans`, which is 2.
