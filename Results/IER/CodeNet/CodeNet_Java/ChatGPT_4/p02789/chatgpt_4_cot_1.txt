<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, n and m, from the input. In this case, the input provided is `3 3`, so both n and m are set to 3.

The code then checks if n is equal to m using an if-else statement. Since both n and m are 3, the condition (n == m) evaluates to true.

As a result, the code enters the if block and prints "Yes" to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
