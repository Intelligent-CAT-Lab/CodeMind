<<<Analysis>>>
The input values are n = 5 and x = 2. The variables a and b are initialized with the maximum and minimum of x and n-x, respectively. So, a = max(2, 5-2) = 3 and b = min(2, 5-2) = 2.

The sum is initialized with the sum of a and b, which is sum = 3 + 2 = 5.

The program enters an infinite loop where it calls the refrect function with the current values of a and b.

In the first call to refrect(a, b), the values are a = 3 and b = 2. Inside the refrect function:
- rest is calculated as a % b = 3 % 2 = 1.
- times is calculated as a / b = 3 / 2 = 1.
- sum is updated as sum += b * times * 2 = 5 + 2 * 1 * 2 = 9.
- Since rest is not 0, sum is not decremented.
- The function returns rest, which is 1.

Back in the main function, a is updated to b (a = 2) and b is updated to c (b = 1).

The loop continues and refrect is called again with a = 2 and b = 1:
- rest is calculated as a % b = 2 % 1 = 0.
- times is calculated as a / b = 2 / 1 = 2.
- sum is updated as sum += b * times * 2 = 9 + 1 * 2 * 2 = 13.
- Since rest is 0, sum is decremented by b, which is sum -= b = 13 - 1 = 12.
- The function returns rest, which is 0.

Since the returned rest is 0, the loop breaks.

The final value of sum is printed, which is 12.
