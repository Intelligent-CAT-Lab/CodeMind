<<<Analysis>>>
The input `3 2` initializes the variable k with 3 and the variable n with 2. The code then checks if k is even. Since 3 is not even, it proceeds to the else block.

In the else block, a List<Integer> named res is created and initialized with n (which is 2) elements, each being (k + 1) / 2. Since k is 3, (k + 1) / 2 is 2. So res is initially [2, 2].

The variable cnt is initialized with n / 2, which is 2 / 2 = 1.

A for loop runs from i = 0 to i < cnt, which means it will run only once since cnt is 1.

Inside the loop, it checks if the last element of res is greater than 1. Since the last element is 2, the condition is true. It then sets the last element to be one less, so res becomes [2, 1].

Then, while the size of res is less than n (which is 2), it adds k (which is 3) to res. However, since the size of res is already 2, it does not add anything.

Finally, the code prints out the elements of res separated by spaces. Since res is [2, 1], it will print "2 1".
