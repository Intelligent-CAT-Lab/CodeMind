<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a `Main` class with the `main` method, which uses an `InputReader` to read two integers from the input. It then checks if the sum of these two integers equals 15, and if so, it prints "+". If their product equals 15, it prints "*". If neither condition is met, it prints "x".

The `InputReader` class is a helper class for reading input from an `InputStream`. It provides methods to read different types of data, such as integers, longs, strings, and arrays of these types. The `nextInt` method is used in the `main` method to read the two integers.

Given the input `4 11`, the `main` method will execute the following steps:
1. Create an `InputReader` object to read from `System.in`.
2. Read two integers, `a` and `b`, which are 4 and 11 respectively.
3. Check if `a + b` equals 15, which it does not (4 + 11 = 15).
4. Check if `a * b` equals 15, which it does not (4 * 11 = 44).
5. Since neither condition is met, the program prints "x".
6. The `PrintWriter` object `w` is closed.
