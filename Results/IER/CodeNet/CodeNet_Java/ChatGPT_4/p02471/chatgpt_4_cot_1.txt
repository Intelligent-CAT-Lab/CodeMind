The code is an implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b), where gcd is the greatest common divisor of a and b.

The input provided is `4 12`. The variables are initialized as follows:
- r1 = a = 4
- x1 = 1
- y1 = 0
- r2 = b = 12
- x2 = 0
- y2 = 1

The while loop will continue to execute as long as r2 is not equal to 0. Inside the loop, the following operations are performed:
1. q (quotient) is calculated as r1 divided by r2, which is 4 / 12 = 0.
2. r3 (remainder) is calculated as r1 modulo r2, which is 4 % 12 = 4.
3. x3 is calculated as x1 - q * x2, which is 1 - 0 * 0 = 1.
4. y3 is calculated as y1 - q * y2, which is 0 - 0 * 1 = 0.
5. The values of r1, x1, and y1 are updated to the values of r2, x2, and y2 respectively.
6. The values of r2, x2, and y2 are updated to the values of r3, x3, and y3 respectively.

After the first iteration:
- r1 = 12
- x1 = 0
- y1 = 1
- r2 = 4
- x2 = 1
- y2 = 0

The loop continues with the new values:
1. q is now 12 / 4 = 3.
2. r3 is now 12 % 4 = 0.
3. x3 is now 0 - 3 * 1 = -3.
4. y3 is now 1 - 3 * 0 = 1.

After the second iteration, since r2 becomes 0, the loop terminates.

The final values of x1 and y1 are printed, which are -3 and 1 respectively. These are the coefficients of a and b in the equation ax + by = gcd(a, b).

Therefore, the output will be `-3 1`.
