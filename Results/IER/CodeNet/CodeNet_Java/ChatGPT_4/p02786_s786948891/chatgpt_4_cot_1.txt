<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h is initialized with the value 2 according to the input. The variables ans and t are initialized with 0 and 1 respectively.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as h is greater than or equal to t.
In the first iteration, t is 1, which is less than or equal to h (2), so ans is increased by t (ans = ans + t), resulting in ans = 0 + 1 = 1. Then t is doubled (t = t * 2), resulting in t = 2.
In the second iteration, t is now equal to h (both are 2), so the loop condition is still true. The value of ans is increased by t again, resulting in ans = 1 + 2 = 3. Then t is doubled again, resulting in t = 4.
Now, t is 4, which is greater than h (2), so the loop terminates.
The final value of ans, which is 3, is printed as the output.
