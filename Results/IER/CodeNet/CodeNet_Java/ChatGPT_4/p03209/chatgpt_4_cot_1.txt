<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `2 7`. The Scanner class reads the input and assigns `n = 2` and `x = 7`.

The `main` method calls `calc(2, 7)`.

In the `calc` method:
- Since `n` is not 0, it does not return 1 immediately.
- It decrements `x` by 1, so `x` becomes 6.
- It calculates `length` for `n-1` which is `length(1)`. The `length` method returns `1 + 4 * (2^1 - 1) = 5`.
- It calculates `p` for `n-1` which is `p(1)`. The `p` method returns `1 + 2 * (2^1 - 1) = 3`.

The first `if` condition checks if `x > 0` which is true since `x` is 6.
- Since `length` (5) is not less than `x` (6), it adds `p` (3) to `sum`.
- It then decrements `x` by `length` (5), so `x` becomes 1.

The second `if` condition checks if `x > 0` which is true since `x` is 1.
- It decrements `x` by 1, so `x` becomes 0.
- It increments `sum` by 1.

The third `if` condition checks if `x > 0` which is false since `x` is 0.

The `calc` method returns `sum` which is now 4.

The `main` method prints the result of `calc(2, 7)` which is 4.
