<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main class with a main method and a nested FastReader class to read input efficiently. The FastReader class uses a BufferedReader and StringTokenizer to parse input.

The main method creates an instance of FastReader and PrintWriter. It then reads two integers, k and b, from the input using the nextInt() method of FastReader. The input values are 2 and 2, respectively.

Before storing the values in k and b, the code subtracts 1 from each, so k becomes 1 and b becomes 1.

The code then calculates the product of k and b, which is 1 * 1 = 1.

Finally, the code prints the result (1) using the PrintWriter and flushes the PrintWriter to ensure the output is sent to System.out.
