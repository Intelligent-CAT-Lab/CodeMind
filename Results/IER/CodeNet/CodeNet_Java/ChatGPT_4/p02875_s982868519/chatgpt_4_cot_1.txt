<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a `main` method that creates an instance of an inner class `Solver` and calls its `solve` method. The `Solver` class contains a method `solve` that calculates a specific value based on the input number.

The `solve` method first prepares factorial and inverse factorial arrays by calling `prepareFact`. Then it reads an integer `num` from the input, which is `2` in this case.

The main calculation is done in the `solve` method. It calculates the power of 3 raised to `num` (which is `3^2 = 9`), and then it enters a loop that iterates from `num` down to `num / 2` (which is `2` down to `1` in this case). In each iteration, it subtracts from `ans` the value of `C(num, i) * pow_m(2, num - i)` multiplied by `2`, where `C` is the combination function (n choose k), and `pow_m` is a method that calculates the power of a number modulo a certain MOD value (which is `998244353`).

For `num = 2`, the loop will have only one iteration with `i = 2`. The calculation will be:
- `C(2, 2) = 1` (since 2 choose 2 is 1)
- `pow_m(2, 2 - 2) = pow_m(2, 0) = 1` (since any number to the power of 0 is 1)
- The subtraction from `ans` will be `1 * 1 * 2 = 2`

So, `ans` will be `9 - 2 = 7`. Since the MOD value is very large and `ans` is less than MOD, there is no need to apply the `mod` function to the result.

Finally, the `solve` method prints the value of `ans`, which is `7`.
