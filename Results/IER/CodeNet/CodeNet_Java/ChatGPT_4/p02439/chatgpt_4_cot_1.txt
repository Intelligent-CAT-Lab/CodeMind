<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three integer variables a, b, and c with the values 4, 5, and 3 respectively according to the input.
It then calculates the minimum of a and b, which are 4 and 5, so the variable min is set to 4.
Next, it calculates the maximum of a and b, which are 4 and 5, so the variable max is set to 5.
The code then prints two values separated by a space. The first value is the minimum of min and c, which are 4 and 3, so the first value printed is 3.
The second value is the maximum of max and c, which are 5 and 3, so the second value printed is 5.
<<<Output>>>
3 5
