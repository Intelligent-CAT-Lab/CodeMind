The input is `4`, which is assigned to the variable `l`. The variables `n` and `m` are initialized to `1` and `0`, respectively. A `StringBuilder` object `sb` is created to build the output string.

The while loop starts with the condition `(1<<(n-1))-1 < l`. The loop is used to find the smallest `n` such that `(1<<(n-1))-1` is not less than `l`. The loop increments `n` until the condition is false. For the input `4`, the loop runs until `n` is `3`, because `(1<<(3-1))-1 = 3` is not less than `4`. After the loop, `n` is decremented by `1`, so `n` becomes `2`.

Next, a for loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (which is `1` in this case). It appends two lines to `sb` for each iteration. Since `n` is `2`, the loop runs only once, and the following lines are appended to `sb`:
```
1 2 0
1 2 1
```
The variable `m` is incremented by `2` for the two lines added, so `m` becomes `2`.

The next part of the code is another while loop that runs while `l-max > 1`. The variable `max` is initialized to `(1<<(n-1))-1`, which is `1` for the current value of `n`. Since `l-max` is `3`, the loop condition is true.

Inside the loop, a variable `k` is initialized to `1`. Another while loop is used to find the largest `k` such that `(1<<(k-1))` is less than `l-max`. For the current values, `k` becomes `2` because `(1<<(2-1)) = 1` is less than `3`. After finding `k`, the following line is appended to `sb`:
```
2 2 2
```
The variable `m` is incremented by `1`, so `m` becomes `3`. The variable `max` is updated to `max + (1<<k-1)`, which becomes `2`.

Since `l-max` is now `2`, the loop condition `l-max > 1` is false, and the loop ends.

Finally, the program prints the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the content of `sb`. The output is:
```
2 3
1 2 0
1 2 1
2 2 2
```
