The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input. The variable d is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5. The variable i serves as the loop counter.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of all integers from 1 to n by multiplying the current value of d with the loop counter i and storing the result back into d.
The loop runs as follows:
- When i = 1, d = 1 * 1 = 1
- When i = 2, d = 1 * 2 = 2
- When i = 3, d = 2 * 3 = 6
- When i = 4, d = 6 * 4 = 24
- When i = 5, d = 24 * 5 = 120
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of d as output, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
