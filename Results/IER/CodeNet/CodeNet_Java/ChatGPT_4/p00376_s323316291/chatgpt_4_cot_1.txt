<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It then reads two integers, x1 and x2, from the input which are 20 and 30 respectively according to the given input.

The code then calculates the absolute difference between x1 and x2 using the Math.abs() method. The absolute difference between 20 and 30 is 10.

Finally, the code prints the result of the absolute difference calculation, which is 10, to the standard output stream (System.out).

The Scanner object is then closed to prevent resource leaks.
<<<Output>>>
10
