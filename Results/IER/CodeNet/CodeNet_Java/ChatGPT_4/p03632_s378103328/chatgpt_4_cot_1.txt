The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized with 0, 75, 25, and 100 respectively according to the input. The variables minSec and maxSec are initialized with Integer.MAX_VALUE and 0 respectively.

The code enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 100. For each iteration, it checks two conditions:
- Whether the current value of i is within the range [a, b], which is [0, 75].
- Whether the current value of i is within the range [c, d], which is [25, 100].

The loop is looking for values of i that satisfy both conditions, meaning values that are in the intersection of the two ranges. The intersection of the two ranges [0, 75] and [25, 100] is [25, 75].

As the loop iterates, it finds that values from 25 to 75 satisfy both conditions. For each of these values, it updates maxSec to the current value of i if it's greater than the current maxSec, and updates minSec to the current value of i if it's less than the current minSec.

After the loop, minSec will be 25 (the smallest value in the intersection), and maxSec will be 75 (the largest value in the intersection).

The code then checks if minSec is still Integer.MAX_VALUE, which would mean no intersection was found. However, in this case, an intersection was found, so it calculates the difference between maxSec and minSec, which is 75 - 25.

Finally, it prints the result of this subtraction, which is 50.
