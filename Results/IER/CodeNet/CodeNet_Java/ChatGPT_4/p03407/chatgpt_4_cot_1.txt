<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input, which are 50, 100, and 120. It then checks if the sum of the first two integers (50 + 100) is greater than or equal to the third integer (120). Since 50 + 100 equals 150, which is indeed greater than 120, the condition is true. Therefore, the code will print "Yes" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
