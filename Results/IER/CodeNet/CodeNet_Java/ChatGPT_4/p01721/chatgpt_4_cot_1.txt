<<<Analysis>>>
The input values are assigned to the variables as follows:
- w = 10
- h = 10
- v = 1
- t = 10
- x = 3
- y = 3
- p = 7
- q = 7

The `Wave` class is instantiated with these values, and the `attack()` method is called to calculate the result.

The `attack()` method calculates the maximum distance the wave can travel, which is the velocity (v) multiplied by the time (t), squared. This is because the distance formula is used in its squared form to avoid taking square roots for efficiency. The maximum distance squared is therefore (1 * 10)^2 = 100.

The method then calculates the maximum width (maxW) that the wave can reach by incrementing maxW until the distance from the origin (0,0) to (maxW,0) is greater than the maximum distance squared. The loop stops when maxW is 1, because getPowDistance(1, 0) is greater than 100.

The method then calculates the number of points the wave can reach by iterating over the possible heights (h) and widths (w) and checking if the distance to each point is within the maximum distance squared. It adds the number of points for positive w and subtracts for negative w to avoid double counting.

The getPowDistance method calculates the squared distance from the wave's origin to a point (mx, my) considering reflections off the walls. The distance is calculated based on the number of reflections (even or odd) and the position of the point relative to the origin.

The final result is the sum of all points the wave can reach, which is the value returned by the `attack()` method.

The output is then printed to the console.
