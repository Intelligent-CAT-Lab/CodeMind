<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a single integer `1900` which is assigned to the variable `n`. The code then calculates `n % 1000`, which is the remainder of `n` divided by `1000`. For the input `1900`, this calculation results in `x` being `900`.

The variable `answer` is initialized to `0`. The code checks if `x` is greater than `0`, which it is in this case. Since `x` is `900`, the condition is true, and the code executes the block inside the if statement. It calculates `1000 - x`, which is `1000 - 900 = 100`. The result `100` is assigned to `answer`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `answer` converted to a string using `String.valueOf(answer)`. The output will be the string representation of `100`.
