<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "KIHBR". The program defines a regex pattern "A?KIHA?BA?RA?$" which is used to match the input string. The regex pattern is designed to match strings that start with an optional 'A', followed by 'KIH', followed by an optional 'A', followed by 'B', followed by an optional 'A', and ending with 'R' with an optional 'A' at the end.

The '?' in the regex pattern indicates that the preceding character is optional and can appear 0 or 1 times.

The input string "KIHBR" is checked against this pattern. The string does not start with an 'A', which is fine because 'A' is optional. It has 'KIH' followed by 'B' and then 'R'. There are no 'A's in between these characters or at the end, which is also fine because the 'A's are optional.

Since the input string "KIHBR" fits the pattern described by the regex, the program will output "YES".
