<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3`, which is read by the `InputReader` class and passed to the `solve` method of the `AC_GC_22_B` class as the variable `n`.

The `solve` method checks if `n` is equal to 3. Since it is, the method immediately prints "2 5 63" and returns, skipping the rest of the code.

The rest of the code is designed to generate a list of numbers that are either divisible by 2 or 3, and then print them out, but since the condition for `n == 3` is met, this code is not executed.

Therefore, the output will be the numbers "2 5 63" printed on a single line.
<<<Output>>>
2 5 63
