<<<Analysis>>>
The input "7 7" initializes the ArrayList `one` with two integers: 7 (N) and 7 (d). The code then checks if N is less than or equal to 2, which it is not, so it proceeds.

N is decremented by 3, resulting in N = 4. The variable `loop` is calculated as N divided by 11, which is 4 / 11 = 0 (since we are dealing with integer division). The variable `amari` is the remainder of N divided by 11, which is 4 % 11 = 4.

The 2D array `map` is defined with 11 rows and 11 columns, representing different values based on the remainder `amari` and the digit `d`.

The output is calculated as `loop * 5 + map[d][amari]`. Since `loop` is 0, it does not contribute to the output. We look at the 7th row (since d = 7) and the 4th column (since amari = 4) of the `map` array to find the value to add to the output. The value at `map[7][4]` is 2.

Therefore, the output is 0 * 5 + 2 = 2.
