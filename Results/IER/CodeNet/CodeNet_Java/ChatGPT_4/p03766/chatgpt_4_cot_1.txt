The input is `2`, which means `n` is set to 2. The `solve` method initializes arrays `f` and `suffix` with size `n + 1` (which is 3 in this case) and fills them with `-1`. It then sets `f[n]` and `suffix[n]` to `n` (which is 2).

The `solve` method calls `f(1)`, which triggers a recursive computation. Here's the breakdown of the recursive calls:

1. `f(1)` is called.
   - Since `f[1]` is `-1`, it calculates `f(2)` (which is `2` because `f[n]` was set to `n`).
   - It then checks if `i + 3 <= n` (which is not true for `i = 1` and `n = 2`), so it skips the if block and goes to the else block.
   - In the else block, it calculates `f[1]` as `mod.plus(f[1], mod.mul(n - 1, n))`, which is `mod.plus(2, mod.mul(1, 2))`, resulting in `2 + 2 = 4` (since we're working with modular arithmetic with a modulus of `1e9 + 7`, there's no need to apply the modulus for such small numbers).

2. `f(2)` is called.
   - Since `f[2]` was set to `n` (which is `2`), it just returns `2`.

3. `suffix(1)` is called within `f(1)`.
   - Since `suffix[1]` is `-1`, it calculates `mod.plus(f[1], suffix(2))`.
   - `suffix(2)` is `2` because `suffix[n]` was set to `n`.
   - So `suffix[1]` is `mod.plus(4, 2)`, which is `6`.

The final answer is the result of `f(1)`, which is `4`. The `solve` method prints this value.
