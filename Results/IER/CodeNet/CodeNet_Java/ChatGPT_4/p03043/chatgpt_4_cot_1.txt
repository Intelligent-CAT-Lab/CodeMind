<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3 10`, which initializes N with 3 and K with 10.

The `solve` method is called with these values. Inside the `solve` method, a loop runs from 1 to N (inclusive), which means it will run for the values 1, 2, and 3.

For each iteration of the loop, the `calc` method is called with the current value of i and K. The `calc` method calculates how many times the value of i needs to be doubled to reach or exceed K. The `ans` variable is also doubled the same number of times to represent the number of times a coin needs to be flipped to get heads (starting from the value of i).

For i = 1:
- The `calc` method will double 1 until it reaches or exceeds 10. This happens 4 times (1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16).
- Therefore, `ans` is also doubled 4 times (1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16).

For i = 2:
- The `calc` method will double 2 until it reaches or exceeds 10. This happens 3 times (2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16).
- Therefore, `ans` is also doubled 3 times (1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8).

For i = 3:
- The `calc` method will double 3 until it reaches or exceeds 10. This happens 2 times (3 -> 6 -> 12).
- Therefore, `ans` is also doubled 2 times (1 -> 2 -> 4).

The `solve` method then calculates the probability `wk` for each i by dividing 1 by the product of `cnt` (the result from `calc`) and N. It then adds this probability to `ans` to accumulate the total probability.

For i = 1:
- `cnt` is 16, so `wk` is 1 / (16 * 3) = 1 / 48.

For i = 2:
- `cnt` is 8, so `wk` is 1 / (8 * 3) = 1 / 24.

For i = 3:
- `cnt` is 4, so `wk` is 1 / (4 * 3) = 1 / 12.

The total probability `ans` is the sum of all `wk` values:
- `ans` = (1 / 48) + (1 / 24) + (1 / 12) = (1 + 2 + 4) / 48 = 7 / 48.

Finally, the `solve` method prints out the value of `ans`.

The output will be the value of `ans` formatted as a decimal number by the `println` method of `PrintWriter`. Since the `println` method is used, it will print the number with a default number of decimal places determined by how Java converts double to a string for printing.
