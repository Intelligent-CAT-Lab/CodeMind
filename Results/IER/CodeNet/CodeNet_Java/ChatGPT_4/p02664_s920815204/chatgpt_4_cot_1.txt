<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string S from the input, which is "PD?D??P".
It then calls the `replaceAll` method on the string S, replacing all occurrences of the "?" character with "D".
The `replaceAll` method uses a regular expression, where "\\?" represents the literal "?" character (the backslash is used as an escape character in Java regular expressions).
The output will be the modified string with all "?" replaced by "D".
