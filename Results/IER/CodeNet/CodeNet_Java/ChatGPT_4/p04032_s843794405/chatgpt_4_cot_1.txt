<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "needed" is read and stored in the variable str. The length of the string is 6, which is stored in the variable size.

The first for loop iterates from 1 to 5 (since size is 6). It checks if any two consecutive characters in the string are the same. If such a pair is found, it prints the indices of these characters (1-based index) and exits the program.

The second for loop is not executed if the first for loop finds a pair of consecutive characters that are the same. If the first loop does not find such a pair, the second for loop starts iterating from 2 to 5. It checks if there are characters in the string that are the same and have exactly one character between them. If such a pair is found, it prints the indices of the characters surrounding the middle character (1-based index) and exits the program.

If neither loop finds a pair of matching characters as described, the program prints "-1 -1".

For the input "needed", the first for loop finds that the characters at indices 3 and 4 (0-based index) are the same ('e'). Therefore, it prints "4 5" (1-based index) and exits the program without executing the second for loop.
