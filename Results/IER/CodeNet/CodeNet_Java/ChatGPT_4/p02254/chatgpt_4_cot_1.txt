<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "abca". The frequency array is calculated for each character 'a' to 'z'. The frequencies of the characters in the string "abca" are:
- 'a': 2
- 'b': 1
- 'c': 1
- 'd' to 'z': 0

A priority queue is created to store pairs of nodes and their frequencies. The nodes represent characters, and the frequencies represent how often they appear in the string. The priority queue is ordered by frequency.

The map is filled with the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' and their corresponding nodes. The priority queue is filled with pairs:
- ('a', 2)
- ('b', 1)
- ('c', 1)

The while loop will run until there is only one pair left in the priority queue. It will combine the two pairs with the lowest frequencies by creating a new parent node and updating the frequencies. The steps are as follows:

1. Poll 'b' (frequency 1) and 'c' (frequency 1), create a new parent node '.', and add the new pair ('.', 2) to the queue.
   Queue now contains: ('a', 2), ('.', 2)

2. Poll 'a' (frequency 2) and '.' (frequency 2), create a new parent node '.', and add the new pair ('.', 4) to the queue.
   Queue now contains: ('.', 4)

Now the queue has only one element, so the while loop ends.

The final step is to calculate the total cost of the string encoding. The depth of each character node in the tree is used to calculate the cost. The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the root of the tree. The cost is the frequency of the character times its depth.

- 'a' has a depth of 2 (since it's a child of the second '.' created).
- 'b' has a depth of 3 (since it's a grandchild of the second '.' created).
- 'c' has a depth of 3 (since it's a grandchild of the second '.' created).

The total cost is:
- 'a': 2 * 2 = 4
- 'b': 1 * 3 = 3
- 'c': 1 * 3 = 3

The sum of the costs is 4 + 3 + 3 = 10.

Since the map size is greater than 1, the result printed is the sum of the costs, which is 10.

10
