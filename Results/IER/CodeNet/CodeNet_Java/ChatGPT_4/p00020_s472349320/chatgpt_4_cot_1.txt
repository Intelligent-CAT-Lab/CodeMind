<<<Analysis>>>
The code uses a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). It enters a while loop that continues as long as there is more input to read (sc.hasNext() returns true). Inside the loop, it reads a line of input into the string variable 's' using sc.nextLine(). It then converts the string 's' to uppercase using the toUpperCase() method and prints it out. Since the input provided is "this is a pen.", the output will be the uppercase version of this string, which is "THIS IS A PEN.".
<<<Output>>>
THIS IS A PEN.
