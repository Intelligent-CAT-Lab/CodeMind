The input is `101`, which is read by the `In` class's `ni()` method and assigned to the variable `k`. The `solve()` method is then called.

The `solve()` method first checks if `k` is divisible by 2 or 5. Since `101` is not divisible by either 2 or 5, the program skips the `if` block and proceeds to the `else` block.

In the `else` block, a variable `count` is initialized with the value `1`, and a variable `cur` is initialized with `7 % k`, which is `7 % 101 = 7`.

The program then enters a `while` loop that continues until `cur` equals `0`. Inside the loop, `count` is incremented by `1` each iteration. The value of `cur` is updated by multiplying it by `10` and adding `7`, then taking the result modulo `k`. This process is repeated until `cur` becomes `0`.

The loop works as follows:
- `cur = 7`, `count = 1`
- `cur = (7 * 10 + 7) % 101 = 77`, `count = 2`
- `cur = (77 * 10 + 7) % 101 = 49`, `count = 3`
- `cur = (49 * 10 + 7) % 101 = 4`, `count = 4`
- `cur = (4 * 10 + 7) % 101 = 47`, `count = 5`
- `cur = (47 * 10 + 7) % 101 = 74`, `count = 6`
- `cur = (74 * 10 + 7) % 101 = 42`, `count = 7`
- `cur = (42 * 10 + 7) % 101 = 14`, `count = 8`
- `cur = (14 * 10 + 7) % 101 = 47`, `count = 9`

At this point, we notice that `cur` has returned to a previous value (`47`), which means it has entered a cycle and will never reach `0`. Therefore, the loop will run indefinitely, and the program will never print an output.

However, the code does not have a mechanism to detect such cycles, and the problem statement does not specify what to do in such cases. In a real-world scenario, this would be a bug, and the program would need to be fixed to handle such inputs correctly.

Since the loop will never terminate, the program will not produce any output for the given input `101`.
