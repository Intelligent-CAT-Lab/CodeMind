<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is `0??`?`. The main method first converts this string to a character array s. It then initializes sum and start to 0. The for loop in the main method iterates over the character array to calculate the initial sum and the minimum value of start.

During the first iteration (i=0), s[i] is '0', so sum becomes -1 and start becomes -1.
During the second iteration (i=1), s[i] is '?', so sum becomes 0 (since '?' is treated as '1' for sum calculation) and start remains -1.
During the third iteration (i=2), s[i] is '?', so sum becomes 1 and start remains -1.
During the fourth iteration (i=3), s[i] is '`', which is not '0' or '1', so it is ignored in the sum calculation, and start remains -1.

After the loop, the main method calls the solve method twice with the parameters (s.clone(), start) and (s.clone(), start - 1), which are (s.clone(), -1) and (s.clone(), -2) respectively. The minimum of the two results will be printed.

Let's analyze the first call to solve(s.clone(), -1):
- The sum starts at 0, maxPrefix at 0, and index is an empty TreeSet.
- Iterating over the array:
  - i=0: s[i] is '0', sum becomes -1.
  - i=1: s[i] is '?', sum becomes -2, '?' is replaced with '0', and index 1 is added to the TreeSet.
  - i=2: s[i] is '?', sum becomes -3, '?' is replaced with '0', and index 2 is added to the TreeSet.
  - i=3: s[i] is '`', which is ignored.
- Since sum < minPrefix (-1), the while loop is entered:
  - The last index in TreeSet (2) is removed, s[2] is set to '1', sum becomes -1.
  - The while loop is not entered again because sum is now equal to minPrefix.
- The second for loop recalculates sum and maxPrefix:
  - i=0: s[i] is '0', sum becomes -1.
  - i=1: s[i] is '0', sum becomes -2.
  - i=2: s[i] is '1', sum becomes -1.
  - i=3: s[i] is '`', which is ignored.
  - maxPrefix is 0 throughout the loop.
- The result of the first call to solve is maxPrefix - minPrefix, which is 0 - (-1) = 1.

Now, let's analyze the second call to solve(s.clone(), -2):
- The sum starts at 0, maxPrefix at 0, and index is an empty TreeSet.
- Iterating over the array:
  - i=0: s[i] is '0', sum becomes -1.
  - i=1: s[i] is '?', sum becomes -2, '?' is replaced with '0', and index 1 is added to the TreeSet.
  - i=2: s[i] is '?', sum becomes -3, '?' is replaced with '0', and index 2 is added to the TreeSet.
  - i=3: s[i] is '`', which is ignored.
- Since sum < minPrefix (-2), the while loop is entered:
  - The last index in TreeSet (2) is removed, s[2] is set to '1', sum becomes -1.
  - The while loop is not entered again because sum is now equal to minPrefix.
- The second for loop recalculates sum and maxPrefix:
  - i=0: s[i] is '0', sum becomes -1.
  - i=1: s[i] is '0', sum becomes -2.
  - i=2: s[i] is '1', sum becomes -1.
  - i=3: s[i] is '`', which is ignored.
  - maxPrefix is 0 throughout the loop.
- The result of the second call to solve is maxPrefix - minPrefix, which is 0 - (-2) = 2.

The main method prints the minimum of the two results, which is 1.
