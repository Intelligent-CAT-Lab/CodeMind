<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized with 5, 7, and 5 respectively according to the input. The boolean variable flag is initialized with false.
The code then checks if any two of the three variables are equal and the third one is not equal to the other two. The following conditions are checked:
1. If a equals b and b is not equal to c, then flag is set to true.
2. Else if b equals c and c is not equal to a, then flag is set to true.
3. Else if c equals a and a is not equal to b, then flag is set to true.

In this case, the third condition is true because c (5) equals a (5) and a (5) is not equal to b (7). Therefore, flag is set to true.

After the conditions are checked, the code checks the value of flag. If flag is true, it prints "Yes". If flag is false, it prints "No".

Since flag is true in this case, the output will be "Yes".
