<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and stores it in the string variable `t`. The input is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple."

The first operation replaces all occurrences of "apple" with a newline character "\n". After this operation, the string `t` becomes "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one \n."

The second operation replaces all occurrences of "peach" with "apple". After this operation, the string `t` becomes "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one \n."

The third operation replaces all newline characters "\n" with "peach". After this operation, the string `t` becomes "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach."

Finally, the modified string `t` is printed to the console.

<<<Output>>>
the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.
