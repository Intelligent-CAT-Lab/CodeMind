<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `3`. The `main` method creates an instance of `MyInput` to read this input and an instance of `PrintWriter` to write the output. It then calls the `solve` method of `CSkolemXORTree` with the input and output instances.

In the `solve` method, the input `3` is read as `n`. The variable `h` is calculated as the highest one bit of `n + 1` minus 1, which is `Integer.highestOneBit(4) - 1`, resulting in `3 - 1 = 2`.

The first `if` condition checks if `n` is less than or equal to `2` or equal to `h + 1`. Since `n` is `3` and `h + 1` is also `3`, the condition is true. Therefore, the method prints "No" and returns immediately.

The rest of the code is not executed because the method has returned after printing "No".

<<<Output>>>
No
