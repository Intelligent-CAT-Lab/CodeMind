<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the console. It then reads a line of input and splits it into two parts using the space character as a delimiter. These two parts are assumed to be string representations of numbers.

The two parts of the string are then converted into BigInteger objects, `a` and `b`, using their respective string representations.

The code then calculates the sum of `a` and `b` using the `add` method of the BigInteger class and stores the result in the BigInteger object `c`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `c`, which is the sum of the two BigIntegers `a` and `b`.

Given the input `5 8`, the code will create two BigIntegers with values 5 and 8, respectively, and then calculate their sum, which is 13.
<<<Output>>>
13
