The input is `3`, which is assigned to the variable `n`. The main method calls the function `f(n+1)`, which means `f(4)` in this case.

The function `f` is a recursive function that uses memoization to store previously computed results in a HashMap `mb`.

1. The first call is `f(4)`. Since there is no memoized result for `4`, it proceeds with the computation.
2. It checks if `n <= 2`, which is not the case, so it calls `f(n/2)`, `f((n-1)/2)`, and `f((n+1)/2)` which are `f(2)`, `f(1)`, and `f(2)` respectively.
3. `f(2)` returns `2` immediately because `n <= 2`.
4. `f(1)` also returns `1` immediately because `n <= 2`.
5. The result of `f(4)` is the sum of these calls: `f(2) + f(1) + f(2)` which is `2 + 1 + 2 = 5`. This result is then stored in the HashMap `mb` with the key `4`.
6. The result `5` is then taken modulo `MOD` (1000000007), which is still `5` because `5` is less than `MOD`.
7. The function `f(4)` returns `5`.

The main method then prints the result of `f(4)`, which is `5`.
