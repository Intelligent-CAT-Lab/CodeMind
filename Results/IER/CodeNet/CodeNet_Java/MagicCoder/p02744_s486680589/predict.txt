The variable N is initialized with 1 according to the input.
It enters a recursive function dfs(ArrayList<String> list, int max) which is a depth-first search algorithm. It starts with an empty list and a maximum index of 0.
Inside the dfs function, it checks if the size of the list is equal to N. If it is, it adds the current list to the output and returns.
If the size of the list is not equal to N, it iterates from 0 to the maximum index.
