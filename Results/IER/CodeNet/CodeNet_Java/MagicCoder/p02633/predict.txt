The variable n is initialized with 90 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 1 to infinity. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current interger i*n is divisible by 360. If it is, it prints the current interger i as output and returns.
The condition is met when i*n is divisible by 360 for i=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,
