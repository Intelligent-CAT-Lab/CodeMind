I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

<<<Output>>>

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```<>>```

@@ Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "<<>>". The length of the string is 2.

The code starts by initializing a variable'sum' to 0 and 'ptr' to 0. 'ptr' is used as a pointer to traverse the string. 'cnt' is used to count the number of '>' characters. 'curr' is used to count the number of '<' characters.

The code then enters a while loop that continues until 'ptr' is less than the length of the string. Inside the loop, if the character at 'ptr' is '>', it enters another while loop that continues until 'ptr' is less than the length of the string and the character at 'ptr' is '>'. Inside this loop, 'ptr' is incremented and 'cnt' is incremented.

After the while loop, if 'curr' is greater than 'cnt','sum' is incremented by 'curr' plus the sum of the first 'cnt' natural numbers, else'sum' is incremented by the sum of the first 'cnt+1' natural numbers. 'curr' is set to 0 and 'cnt' is set to 0.

If the character at 'ptr' is '<','sum' is incremented by 'curr'. 'curr' is incremented and 'ptr' is incremented.

After the while loop, if the last character of the string is '<','sum' is incremented by 'curr'.

Finally, the code prints'sum' and closes the output stream.
