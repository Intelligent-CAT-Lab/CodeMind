The input string is "aab". The code first calculates the Z-function for the string and its reverse. The Z-function for a string is an array of length n where the i-th element is the length of the longest substring starting from the position i which is also a prefix of the string.

The code then checks if the string is a repetition of its own substring. If it is, the output is 1 1. If not, it calculates the number of positions where the string is not a repetition of its own substring.

The Z-function is calculated by the Z function method. The method starts by initializing the Z array with the length of the string. Then it iterates over the string, updating the Z array as it goes.
