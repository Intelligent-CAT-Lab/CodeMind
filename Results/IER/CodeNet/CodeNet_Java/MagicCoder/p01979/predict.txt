The input number is converted into an array of digits. Then, a 6-dimensional dynamic programming array dp is initialized. The first dimension of dp is the length of the input number plus one. The other five dimensions are used to store the number of ways to form the current number with the digits from 0 to 9.

The dynamic programming array dp is filled in a nested loop. For each digit from 0 to 9, the number of ways to form the current number with the digits from 0 to 9 is calculated. If the current digit is less than the corresponding digit in the input number, the number of ways to form the current number with the digits from 0 to 9 is added to the number of ways to form the previous number with the digits from 0 to 9. If the current digit is equal to the corresponding digit in the input number, the number of ways to form the current number with the digits from 0 to 9 is added to the number of ways to form the previous number with the digits from 0 to 9.

The number of ways to form the current number with the digits from 0 to 9 is added to the number of ways to form the previous number with the digits from 0 to 9.

The number of ways to form the current number with the digits from 0 to 9 is added to the number of ways to form the previous number with the digits from 0 to 9.

The number of ways to form the current number with the digits from 0 to 9 is added to the number of ways to form the previous number with the digits from 0 to 9.

The number of ways to form the current number with the digits from 0 to 9 is added to the number of ways to form the previous number with the digits from 0 to 9.

The number of ways to form the current number with the digits from 0 to 9 is added to the number of ways to form the previous number with the digits from 0 to 9.

The number of ways to form the current number with the digits from 0 to 9 is added to the number of ways to form the previous number with the digits from 0 to 9.

The number of ways to form the current number with the digits from 0 to 9 is added
