The code is a solution for a problem in the contest. The problem is about calculating the number of points in a 3D space that are within a certain distance from a given point. The input is four integers a, b, c and d. The output is the number of points that are within a distance of d from the origin (0, 0, 0) in the 3D space with dimensions a, b, c.

The code uses a technique called "sweeping" to solve the problem. It first calculates the probability of each point being within the distance d from the origin. Then it calculates the number of points that are within the distance d from the origin.
