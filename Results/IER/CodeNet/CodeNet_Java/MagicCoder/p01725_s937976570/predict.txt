The input string is "3-2*3".
The code first checks if the current character is a digit. If it is, it converts the digit to a long integer and adds it to the result.
Then it checks if the current character is an operator. If it is, it calculates the result based on the operator and the previous result and the next number.
The calculation is done in a recursive way. If the current character is '(', it calls the expression method to calculate the result inside the parentheses.
