The variable N and X are initialized with 4 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The solve() function is called to solve the problem.
The solve() function checks if N is 2. If it is, it calls the case_2() function.
If N is not 2, it checks if X is within the range [2, 2*N-2]. If it is, it creates an array of size 2*N-1 and initializes it with the values as per the conditions.
If X is not within the range [2, 2*N-2], it returns null.
The case_2() function is called when N is 2. It checks if X is 2. If it is, it returns
