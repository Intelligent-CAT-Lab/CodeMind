The input string is "ABCABC". The characters in the string are read one by one and placed in a queue.

The queue is then processed. If the first character in the queue is 'A', it is removed and the counter anum is incremented. If the first character is 'B', it is removed and the next character is checked. If the next character is 'C', the counter anum is added to the answer and the next character is removed. If the next character is 'A' or 'B', the counter anum is reset to 0.

The process continues until the queue is empty.

The final answer is the sum of all the counters anum.
