The code is a solution to a problem where it calculates the circumference of a circle given the radius. The input is the radius of the circle.

The code first reads the input using a MyScanner object. The MyScanner object is a custom class that reads input from the standard input stream. It tokenizes the input and provides methods to read integers, longs, doubles, and strings.

The code then calculates the circumference of the circle using the formula 2*pi*r, where r is the radius of the circle. The result is printed using the PrintWriter
