The variable K is initialized with 0 according to the input. The variable N is initialized with 50. The array list list is initialized with 50 elements.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 49 and assigns the value of K/N + i to each element of list.
The for loop iterates from 0 to K%N and for each iteration, it increases the value of each element of list by N + 1 and then decreases the value of each element of list by 1.
The method myout(N) is called to print
