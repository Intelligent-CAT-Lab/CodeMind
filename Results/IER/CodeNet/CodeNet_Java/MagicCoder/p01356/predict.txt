The variables n, m, a, b, p, and q are initialized with 6, 200, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively according to the input.
The code checks if a and b are both 1. If they are, it calculates the minimum value of the absolute difference between m and the sum of p and q multiplied by the number of iterations.
If a and b are not both 1, it calculates the maximum limit for the loop. It then calculates the powers of a and b up to the limit.
It then calculates the
