I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>

The code is a Rubik's Cube solver. It reads the input string "R" and performs the rotation of the cube to the right. The cube is represented as a 2D array of characters, where each character represents a color of a cube. The rotation is performed by swapping the colors of the cube in a specific way.
