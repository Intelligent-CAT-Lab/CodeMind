I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1??00```

Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

@@ Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "1??00". The code is a game where the player can choose to either play 0 or 1. The game is won if the player wins 5 consecutive games. The player wins if the sum of the digits of the number is 5.

The code uses a finite state machine to keep track of the current state of the game. The states are represented by integers from 0 to 8. The state 0 represents the initial state where the player has not played any games yet. The state 9 represents the final state where the player has won 5 games.

The code uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of ways to reach each state. The dp array stores the number of ways to reach each state. The ndp array is used to store the new values of dp while the dp array is updated.

The code iterates over each character in the input string. For each character, it updates the new values of dp by considering both playing 0 and playing 1. If the character is '0' or '?', it updates the state by moving to the state represented by the first element of the corresponding transition in the go array. If the character is '1' or '?', it updates the state by moving to the state represented by the second element of the corresponding transition in the go array.

Finally, the code calculates the number of ways to reach the final state and prints the result modulo 1e9 + 7.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code execution for the input "1??00" is 1. This is because there is only one way to reach the final state from the initial state by playing 1, 0, 0, 0, 0.
