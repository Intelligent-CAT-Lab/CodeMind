The input is 7. The code is a solution to a problem in the contest. The problem is to generate a string of length 600 that contains the string "FESTIVAL" exactly once and the remaining characters can be any of the 26 English alphabets. The string should be lexicographically smallest.

The code uses dynamic programming to solve this problem. It first calculates the number of ways to arrange the string "FESTIVAL" in a lexicographically sorted order. Then it generates the string by finding the k-th string in the sorted order.

The code uses a binary search to find the k-th string. It first calculates the number of strings that have the first i characters in the sorted order. Then it finds the k-th string by recursively dividing the range of possible strings.

The code uses a map to store the position of each character in the string "FESTIVAL". Then it calculates the number of strings that have the first i characters in the sorted order.

The code uses a dynamic programming table to store the number of strings that have the first i characters in the sorted order. Then it calculates the number of strings that have the first i characters in the sorted order.
