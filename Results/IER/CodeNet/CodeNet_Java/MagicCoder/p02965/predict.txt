The variable n and m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable facts[] and factsInv[] are initialized with the factorials of numbers from 0 to n + 3 * m / 2.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from m % 2 to m and for each nOdd, it calculates the number of ways to choose nOdd elements from n elements and subtracts the number of ways to choose (3 * m - nOdd) / 2 elements from n - 1 elements.
The result is added to variable ans.
