The input string is "eel". The string is converted to a character array and the frequency of each character is counted. Then, for each character, the indices of its occurrences are stored in a list. The indices are sorted in ascending order. The minimum number of swaps required to sort the indices is calculated by comparing each index with its correct position. The total number of swaps is added to the answer.

The frequency of each character is stored in an array f. The indices of each character are stored in an array g. The indices of each character are stored in a Fenwick tree ft.
