<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, m, and k. It then initializes two arrays, nextPattern and colorPattern, with size k+1. It also initializes a variable limit with the value 998244353. 

Next, it calculates the number of color combinations when there are k+1 adjacent colors. It does this by iterating from 0 to n-k-2 and multiplying the pattern by m-1 each time. If k is less than n-1, it sets the initial pattern to m. 

Then, it calculates the number of occurrences of 1 to k consecutive colors. It does this by iterating from 0 to k and calculating the nextPattern and colorPattern. The nextPattern is calculated using the formula nCr = nC(r-1) * (n-r) / (r+1), where nCr is the combination of n choose r. The colorPattern is calculated by multiplying the previous colorPattern by m-1. 

Finally, it calculates the total countPattern by summing the product of nextPattern and colorPattern for each index from 0 to k. It takes the modulo of countPattern with the limit and prints the result.
