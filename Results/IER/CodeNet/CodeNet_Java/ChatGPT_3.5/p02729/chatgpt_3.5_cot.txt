<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and m from the input. Then it calculates the number of combinations of n and m using the formula n * (n-1) / 2 and m * (m-1) / 2 respectively. Finally, it adds the two calculated values and prints the result as output.
In this case, n is 2 and m is 1. So, nComb = 2 * (2-1) / 2 = 1 and mComb = 1 * (1-1) / 2 = 0. Therefore, the return value would be 1 + 0 = 1.
