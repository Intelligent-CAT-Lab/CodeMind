<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and m from the input. In this case, n is assigned the value 2 and m is assigned the value 1.
Then, it calculates the value of nComb by multiplying n by (n-1) and dividing the result by 2. In this case, nComb = 2 * (2-1) / 2 = 1.
Similarly, it calculates the value of mComb by multiplying m by (m-1) and dividing the result by 2. In this case, mComb = 1 * (1-1) / 2 = 0.
Finally, it prints the sum of nComb and mComb, which is 1 + 0 = 1.
