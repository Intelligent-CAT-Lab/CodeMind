<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four long integers a, b, c, and d from the input. Then it calculates the maximum value among the products of a and c, a and d, b and c, and b and d. The maximum value is stored in the variable ans. Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the values of a, b, c, and d are 1, 2, 1, and 1 respectively. So, the maximum value among the products is 2, which is the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
2
