The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized with the values 1, 2, 1, and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with the value of a * c, which is 1 * 1 = 1.
Then it compares the value of a * d with the current value of ans and updates ans if a * d is greater.
Next, it compares the value of b * c with the current value of ans and updates ans if b * c is greater.
Finally, it compares the value of b * d with the current value of ans and updates ans if b * d is greater.
After all the comparisons, it prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
