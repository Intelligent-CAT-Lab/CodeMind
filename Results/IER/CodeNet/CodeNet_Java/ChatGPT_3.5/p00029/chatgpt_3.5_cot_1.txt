<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and stores each word of the string in an array called 's'. It also keeps track of the number of occurrences of each word in the array by using another array called 'r'. The code then finds the word with the maximum number of occurrences and prints it. After that, it finds the longest word in the array and prints it as well.
In this case, the input string is "Thank you for your mail and your lectures". The code will split this string into individual words and store them in the 's' array. The 'r' array will keep track of the number of occurrences of each word. The word with the maximum number of occurrences is "your" with a count of 2. The longest word in the array is "lectures". Therefore, the output of the code execution will be "your lectures".
<<<Output>>>
your lectures
