<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using a Scanner object. It reads a series of strings until there is no more input. The strings are stored in an array called 's'. The code then initializes an array called 'r' to keep track of the frequency of each string in the 's' array. It also initializes a boolean array called 'flag' to keep track of whether a string has already been counted or not.

The code then iterates through the 's' array and compares each string with the remaining strings in the array. If a match is found and the corresponding flag is true, it increments the frequency count for that string and sets the flag to false to indicate that it has been counted.

After counting the frequencies, the code finds the string with the maximum frequency and stores its index in the variable 'maxin'. It then prints the string at that index.

Next, the code finds the string with the maximum length and stores its index in the variable 'max'. It then prints the string at that index.
