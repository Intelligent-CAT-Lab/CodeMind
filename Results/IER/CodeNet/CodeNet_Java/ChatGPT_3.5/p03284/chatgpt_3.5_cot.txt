<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and k. It then checks if n is divisible by k by using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder is 0, it means n is divisible by k and the code prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1.
In this case, n=7 and k=3. Since 7 is not divisible by 3, the remainder is 1. Therefore, the code will print 1 as the output.
