<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It checks if n is divisible by k by checking if the remainder of n divided by k is 0. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1.
In this case, n is 7 and k is 3. Since 7 is not divisible by 3, the remainder is 1. Therefore, the output will be 1.
