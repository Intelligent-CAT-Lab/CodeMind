<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable name is initialized as an empty string.
It enters a while loop and it continues until n becomes less than 0. Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of n divided by 26 and assigns it to variable d.
Then it converts the remainder d to a character by adding 97 to it and casts it to char. The resulting character is then concatenated to the beginning of variable name.
After that, it updates the value of n by dividing it by 26 and subtracting 1. This process is repeated until n becomes less than 0.
Finally, it prints the value of variable name as output, which is "b".
<<<Output>>>
b
