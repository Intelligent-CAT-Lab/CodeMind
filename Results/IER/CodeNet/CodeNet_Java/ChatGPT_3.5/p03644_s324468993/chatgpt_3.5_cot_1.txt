The variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input. And variable i is initialized with 0.
It reads an integer from the input and assigns it to variable n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n with a step size of i * 2. In each iteration, it doubles the value of i.
After the loop finishes, it divides the value of i by 2.
Finally, it prints the value of i as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
