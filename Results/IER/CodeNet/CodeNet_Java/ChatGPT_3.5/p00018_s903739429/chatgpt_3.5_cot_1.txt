<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input of 5 integers and stores them in an array called `inp`. It then calls the `quickSort` method to sort the array in ascending order. After sorting, it calls the `arrayPrintln` method to print the sorted array in reverse order.

In the `quickSort` method, it selects a pivot element `p` from the middle of the array. It then partitions the array into two subarrays, one with elements smaller than the pivot and one with elements larger than the pivot. It recursively applies the same process to the subarrays until the entire array is sorted.

In the `arrayPrintln` method, it iterates over the array in reverse order and prints each element followed by a space, except for the last element which is printed without a space. Finally, it prints a new line.

In the `main` method, it reads the input using a `Scanner` and stores the integers in the `inp` array. It then calls the `quickSort` method to sort the array and the `arrayPrintln` method to print the sorted array in reverse order. This process is repeated as long as there is more input to read.
