<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S and counts the number of occurrences of '0' and '1' in the string. It initializes two variables, S0mas and S1mas, to keep track of the count of '0' and '1' respectively. It iterates through each character in the string and if the character is '0', it increments S0mas by 1. After counting the occurrences, it compares the counts of '0' and '1'. If the count of '0' (S0mas) is less than the count of '1' (S1mas), it prints S0mas multiplied by 2. Otherwise, it prints S1mas multiplied by 2.

In the given input string "0011", there are 2 occurrences of '0' and 2 occurrences of '1'. Since the counts of '0' and '1' are equal, the code will print 4.

<<<Output>>>
4
