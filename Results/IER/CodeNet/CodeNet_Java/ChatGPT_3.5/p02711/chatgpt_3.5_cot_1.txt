<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n. Then it converts the integer to a string using the `String.valueOf()` method and stores it in the variable string. 
Next, it checks if the string contains the character '7' using the `contains()` method. If the string contains '7', it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input is 117, which contains the digit 7. So the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
