<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 and variable K is initialized with 1 according to the input. 
Then it enters a while loop which runs once because TEST_CASE is initialized with 1. 
Inside the while loop, it initializes a 3D array called memo with dimensions 2001x2001x2 and fills it with -1.
Then it initializes a variable BIG with the value of mod*mod, where mod is 924844033.
Then it initializes a variable M with the minimum value between 2*K and N.
Then it initializes two arrays dp and tmp with size N+1 and fills them with 0.
Then it sets dp[0] to 1.
Then it initializes a variable sum with 0.
Then it enters a for loop which iterates from 0 to M-1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of y using the formula (N - i - K + 2 * K - 1) / (2 * K).
If i is greater than or equal to K, it increments the value of y by 1.
Then it increments the value of sum by y.
Then it enters another for loop which iterates from sum to 0 in descending order.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of val using the formula val += tmp[j] * dp[k-j].
If val is greater than or equal to BIG, it subtracts BIG from val.
Then it assigns the value of val modulo mod to dp[k].
After the second for loop finishes, it initializes an array called fact with size N+1 and fills it with 0.
Then it assigns 1 to fact[0].
Then it enters a for loop which iterates from 1 to N.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of fact[i] using the formula fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % mod.
Then it initializes a variable s with 1.
Then it initializes a variable ans with 0.
Then it enters another for loop which iterates from 0 to N.
Inside the third for loop, it calculates the value of ans using the formula ans += s * fact[N-i] * dp[i] % mod.
Then it assigns -s to s.
After the third for loop finishes, it prints the value of ans modulo mod.
Finally, it prints a new line character.
