<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then counts the occurrences of each character 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the array. If the absolute difference between any two counts is greater than 1, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".
In this case, the input string is "abac". The count of 'a' is 2, the count of 'b' is 1, and the count of 'c' is 1. The absolute difference between the counts of 'a' and 'b' is 1, and the absolute difference between the counts of 'b' and 'c' is also 1. Therefore, the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
