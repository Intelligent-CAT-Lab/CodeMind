<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user using the Scanner class. It reads 5 integers from the input and stores them in an array called ans. The array is then sorted in descending order using the Arrays.sort() method and a custom Comparator. The sorted array is then converted to a string and returned as the result.

In this case, the input is "3 6 9 7 5". The code reads these integers one by one and stores them in the ans array. The array is then sorted in descending order, resulting in the array [9, 7, 6, 5, 3]. Finally, the sorted array is converted to a string "9 7 6 5 3" and returned as the output.

<<<Output>>>
9 7 6 5 3
