<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of 5 integers. It initializes an array `ans` with 5 elements, all set to 1. It also initializes a variable `count` to keep track of the number of inputs received.

Then, it enters a while loop that continues until there is more input available. Inside the loop, it reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num`. It then stores this `num` in the `ans` array at the index specified by `count`. It increments `count` by 1.

If `count` becomes equal to 5, it means all 5 inputs have been received. In that case, it calls the `strkn` method and passes the `ans` array as an argument. The `strkn` method sorts the array in descending order and converts it to a string with each element separated by a space. This string is then returned.

Finally, the returned string is printed as the output.
