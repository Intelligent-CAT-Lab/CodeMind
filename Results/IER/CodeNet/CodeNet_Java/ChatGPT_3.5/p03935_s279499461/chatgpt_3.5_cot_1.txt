The variable n is initialized with 4 and variable m is initialized with 7 according to the input. The variable mod is initialized with 998244353.
Then it initializes an array f of size 2*n+3 and sets the first two elements of the array to 1.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 2 to the length of array f. In each iteration, it calculates the Fibonacci number at index i and stores it in f[i]. If the calculated Fibonacci number is greater than or equal to mod, it subtracts mod from it.
After that, it initializes two variables prod and s to 1 and 0 respectively.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from n-1 to 0. In each iteration, it calculates the sum s by adding f[2*i+1] multiplied by prod and takes the modulo of the sum with mod. Then it updates the value of prod by multiplying it with ((m+n-i-1) % mod) and taking the modulo with mod. It also multiplies prod with the modular inverse of (n-i) with respect to mod.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of ret by subtracting s from the Fibonacci number at index m+2*n and taking the modulo with mod. If the value of ret is negative, it adds mod to it.
Finally, it prints the value of ret as the output.
