<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input. 
Then it creates an ArrayList of type P called lis.
It initializes variables a and b with 9 and 10 respectively.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to 10.
Inside the loop, it adds a new object of type P to the ArrayList lis. The object has two values, i and -11+i.
Then it adds another object of type P to the ArrayList lis. The object has two values, 19 and -1.
Then it enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to 14.
Inside this loop, it enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to 999.
Inside this loop, it calculates the value of x by multiplying b and w and adding a to it. It also initializes y with the value of x.
Then it initializes a variable e with 0.
Then it enters a while loop that continues until x becomes 0. Inside the loop, it adds the last digit of x to e and then divides x by 10.
Then it adds a new object of type P to the ArrayList lis. The object has two values, y and y/e.
Then it multiplies b by 10 and a by 10 and adds 9 to a.
After the loop finishes, it sorts the ArrayList lis.
Then it initializes a variable max with 0.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates through the elements of the ArrayList lis.
Inside the loop, it checks if the value of max is less than the x value of the current element in the ArrayList lis.
If it is, then it updates the value of max with the x value of the current element and prints it.
Then it decrements the value of n by 1.
If n becomes 0, then it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it flushes the PrintWriter out.
