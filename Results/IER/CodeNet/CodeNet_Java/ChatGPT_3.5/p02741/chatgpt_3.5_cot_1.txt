<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `a` with some predefined values. Then it takes an integer input `k` from the user.
It prints the value at index `k-1` of the array `a` as the output.
In this case, the input is 6. So it will print the value at index 5 of the array `a`, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
