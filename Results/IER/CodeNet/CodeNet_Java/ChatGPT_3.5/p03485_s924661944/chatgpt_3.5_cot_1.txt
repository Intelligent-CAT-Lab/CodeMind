<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input using the Scanner class. It adds the two integers together and then divides the sum by 2.0. The result is then rounded up to the nearest integer using the Math.ceil() method. Finally, the result is printed as output.
In this case, the input is 1 and 3. The sum of 1 and 3 is 4. When divided by 2.0, the result is 2.0. Since Math.ceil() rounds up to the nearest integer, the output will be 2.
