<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 13 according to the input. 
It enters a for loop and it iterates indefinitely. 
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current number n-i is a palindrome by converting it to a string and comparing the characters from the beginning and the end of the string. If it is a palindrome, it prints the number and breaks out of the loop.
If the current number n-i is not a palindrome, it checks if the current number n+i is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome, it prints the number and breaks out of the loop.
The loop continues until a palindrome number is found.
<<<Output>>>
