<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers N and d as input. It then checks the value of d. If d is equal to 1, it calculates N * (N - 1) / 2 and prints the result. If d is equal to 2, it calculates N * (N - 1) / 2 - 1 and prints the result. Otherwise, it calculates m = N - d, ans = m * (m - 1) / 2 + 2 * m + (d - 2), and prints the result.
In this case, N = 4 and d = 3. Since d is not equal to 1 or 2, it calculates m = N - d = 1, ans = m * (m - 1) / 2 + 2 * m + (d - 2) = 1 * (1 - 1) / 2 + 2 * 1 + (3 - 2) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.
