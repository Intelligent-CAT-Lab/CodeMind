<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and d. It then checks the value of d. If d is equal to 1, it calculates and prints N * (N - 1) / 2. If d is equal to 2, it calculates and prints N * (N - 1) / 2 - 1. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the value of ans using the formula ans = m * (m - 1) / 2 + 2 * m + (d - 2), where m = N - d.
In this case, N = 4 and d = 3. Since d is not equal to 1 or 2, it calculates the value of m = N - d = 1. Then it calculates ans = m * (m - 1) / 2 + 2 * m + (d - 2) = 1 * (1 - 1) / 2 + 2 * 1 + (3 - 2) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.
