<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable x and variable m are initialized with 6, 2 and 1001 respectively according to the input.
Then it checks if x is 0 or m is 1. If either of them is true, it prints 0 and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes a 2D array to store the values of to and sum.
It iterates through each element of the array and calculates the values of to and sum based on the previous values.
Then it calculates the final answer by iterating through the binary representation of n and adding the corresponding values of sum and to to the answer.
Finally, it prints the answer.
