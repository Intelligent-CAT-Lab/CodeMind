<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input integer N and converts it into a character array W. It initializes the first element of W as '0' and then copies each digit of N into W. 
Then it calls the sum() method passing W and the length of W as arguments. 
Inside the sum() method, it extracts the last digit of the current number by subtracting '0' from the character at index to in the array N. 
If to is 0, it checks if the last digit is less than or equal to 5. If it is, it returns the last digit as the sum. Otherwise, it returns 11 minus the last digit as the sum. 
If to is not 0, it checks if the last digit is less than 5. If it is, it adds the last digit to the sum of the remaining digits by recursively calling sum() with to-1 as the argument. 
If the last digit is 5, it checks if the previous digit is greater than or equal to 5. If it is, it increments the previous digit by 1 and returns 10 minus the last digit plus the sum of the remaining digits. 
If the previous digit is less than 5, it simply returns the last digit plus the sum of the remaining digits. 
If the last digit is greater than 5, it increments the previous digit by 1 and returns 10 minus the last digit plus the sum of the remaining digits. 
The add() method is used to increment the previous digit by 1 if necessary. It starts from the index ind and checks if the digit is less than or equal to 8. If it is, it increments the digit by 1 and returns. 
If the digit is 9, it sets the digit to 0 and continues to the previous digit until it finds a digit that is less than 9. Then it increments that digit by 1 and returns. 
Finally, the code prints the sum returned by the sum() method as the output.
