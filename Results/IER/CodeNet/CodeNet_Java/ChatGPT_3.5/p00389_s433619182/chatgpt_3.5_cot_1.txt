The variable count is initialized with 4 and variable strength is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable total is initialized with 1 and variable size is initialized with 1. Then it subtracts 1 from variable count.
It enters a while loop with condition true. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of variable x as (total + strength - 1) / strength. If the value of variable count is greater than or equal to x, it increments the value of variable size by 1, adds the value of x to variable total and subtracts the value of x from variable count. Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.
In the first iteration of the loop, the value of x is 1. Since count is greater than or equal to x, it increments size to 2, adds x to total and subtracts x from count. Now, the value of total is 2 and count is 3.
In the second iteration of the loop, the value of x is 2. Since count is greater than or equal to x, it increments size to 3, adds x to total and subtracts x from count. Now, the value of total is 4 and count is 1.
In the third iteration of the loop, the value of x is 2. Since count is less than x, it breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it prints the value of size as output, which is 3.
