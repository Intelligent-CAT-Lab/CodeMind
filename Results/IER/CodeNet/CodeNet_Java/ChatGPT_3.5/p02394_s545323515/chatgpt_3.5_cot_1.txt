<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 5 integers as input: W, H, x, y, and r. It checks if the circle with center (x, y) and radius r lies completely within the rectangle with width W and height H. 
To check this, it verifies if the x-coordinate of the leftmost point of the circle (x-r) is greater than or equal to 0, if the x-coordinate of the rightmost point of the circle (x+r) is less than or equal to W, if the y-coordinate of the bottommost point of the circle (y-r) is greater than or equal to 0, and if the y-coordinate of the topmost point of the circle (y+r) is less than or equal to H. 
If all these conditions are true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the values of W, H, x, y, and r are 5, 4, 2, 2, and 1 respectively. 
The conditions (x-r)>=0, (x+r)<=W, (y-r)>=0, and (y+r)<=H are all true, so the output will be "Yes".
