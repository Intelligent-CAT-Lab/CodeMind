<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. 
It then initializes an array invs with size n+1 and sets the first element to 1.
It then enters a for loop and iterates from 2 to n+1. In each iteration, it calculates the inverse of i modulo MODULO and stores it in invs[i].
After that, it initializes an array e with size n+1 and a variable s with 0.
It then enters a for loop and iterates from n to 1. In each iteration, it calculates the sum of invs[n] and invs[k] modulo MODULO and stores it in s. It also stores the value of s in e[k].
After that, it initializes a variable res with 0 and a variable pw with 1.
It then enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to n. In each iteration, it calculates the value of g by subtracting e[k+1] from e[k], adding MODULO and taking modulo MODULO. It also calculates the value of res by adding g multiplied by pw modulo MODULO.
After that, it enters another for loop and iterates from 1 to n+1. In each iteration, it multiplies res by invs[3] modulo MODULO.
Finally, it prints the value of res as output.
