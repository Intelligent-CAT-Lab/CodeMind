<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input. The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 6 to 55555 with a step of 5. In each iteration, it checks if the current number i is prime by calling the isPrime() method.
The isPrime() method checks if the number n is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of n. If it is divisible, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.
If the current number i is prime, it prints the number i and increments the count variable by 1.
The loop continues until the count variable reaches the value of N.
After the loop finishes, it does not print anything else.
