<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two float inputs x and y. It then calculates the value of a as y divided by (2*x). 
Then it initializes an empty ArrayList called cx to store objects of the class point.
It enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to x (inclusive). Inside the loop, it creates a new object of the class point and assigns the value of x as i*2 and the value of y as y minus (a times p.x). It then adds this object to the ArrayList cx.
Next, it enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to y (inclusive). Inside this loop, it creates a new object of the class point and assigns the value of y as i and the value of x as (y minus p.y) divided by a. It then checks if this object already exists in the ArrayList cx. If it does not exist, it adds this object to the ArrayList cx.
Finally, it prints the size of the ArrayList cx as the output.
