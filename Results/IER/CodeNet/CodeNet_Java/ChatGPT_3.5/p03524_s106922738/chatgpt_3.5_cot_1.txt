<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and counts the occurrences of each character 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string. It stores the counts in an array called 'cnt'. Then it sorts the array in ascending order. Finally, it checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum count in the array is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input string is "abac". The counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are 2, 1, and 1 respectively. After sorting the array, the counts become [1, 1, 2]. The difference between the maximum and minimum count is 2 - 1 = 1, which is less than or equal to 1. Therefore, the output should be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
