<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and k from the input. It then checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between n and k.
In this case, n is 3 and k is 2. Since k is not equal to 1, the code will print the difference between n and k, which is 1.
