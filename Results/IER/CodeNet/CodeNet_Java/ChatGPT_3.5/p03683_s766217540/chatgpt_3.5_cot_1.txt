<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers n and m as input. It calculates the absolute difference between n and m and stores it in variable d. Then it initializes a variable ans with 1.
If the value of d is greater than or equal to 2, it sets ans to 0. Otherwise, it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to the minimum of n and m.
Inside the loop, it multiplies ans by i and takes the modulo with lim (which is 1000000007) if ans is greater than or equal to lim.
After the loop, it multiplies ans by ans and takes the modulo with lim.
If n is equal to m, it multiplies ans by 2. Otherwise, it multiplies ans by the maximum of n and m.
Finally, it takes the modulo with lim and prints the value of ans as output.
In this case, n and m are both 2. The absolute difference between them is 0. So, it enters the for loop and multiplies ans by 1. Then it multiplies ans by ans, which is 1. Since n is equal to m, it multiplies ans by 2. The final value of ans is 2.
