<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: W, a, and b. It then calculates the difference between the larger of a and b and the smaller of a and b, subtracts W from this difference, and takes the maximum of this result and 0. Finally, it prints the result as output.
In this case, W = 3, a = 2, and b = 6. The larger of a and b is 6 and the smaller is 2. The difference between them is 4. Subtracting W from this difference gives 1. Since 1 is greater than 0, the output will be 1.
