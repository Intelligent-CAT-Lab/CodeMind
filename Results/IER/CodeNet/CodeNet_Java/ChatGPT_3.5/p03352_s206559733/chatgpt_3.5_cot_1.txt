<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 10 according to the input. And variable a is initialized with 1, variable i is initialized with 2.
It checks if X is equal to 1, 2 or 3. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
Otherwise, it creates an array of size 1000 and fills it with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until a break statement is encountered.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the square of i and assigns it to variable a.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from a to X with a step size of i.
Inside the for loop, it assigns the value of j to the array at the current index and increments the index.
After the for loop finishes, it increments i by 1.
After the while loop finishes, it sorts the array in parallel.
Then it assigns the value at index 999 of the sorted array to variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 81.
<<<Output>>>
81
