<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user. Then it initializes an integer array `arr` with a size of 4 and an integer variable `total` with a value of 0.
Next, it enters a for loop that iterates 4 times. In each iteration, it reads an integer from the user and stores it in the corresponding index of the `arr` array. It also adds the value to the `total` variable.
After the for loop, it initializes an integer variable `min` with the maximum possible value of an integer.
Then it enters another for loop that iterates 3 times, starting from index 1 of the `arr` array. In each iteration, it calculates the absolute difference between the `total` variable and twice the sum of the first element of the `arr` array and the current element of the `arr` array. It updates the `min` variable with the minimum value between the current `min` value and the calculated difference.
Finally, it prints the value of the `min` variable as the output.
