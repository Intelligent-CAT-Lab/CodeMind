<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and assigns it to variable S. Then it converts the string into a character array using the toCharArray() method and assigns it to variable c.
It then prints the number 2018 followed by the characters in the character array starting from index 4.
So, the output would be 2018/01/07.
