<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in variable S. Then it converts the string into a character array using the toCharArray() method and stores it in variable c.
It then prints the number 2018 followed by the characters in the character array starting from index 4.
In this case, the character array is ['2', '0', '1', '7', '/', '0', '1', '/', '0', '7'].
So the output would be 2018/01/07.
