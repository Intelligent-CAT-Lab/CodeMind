<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then iterates over each character in the array. If the character is 'D' or '?', it increments the count variable and replaces the character with 'D'. Finally, it prints each character in the modified array and adds a new line character at the end.

In this case, the input string is "PD?D??P" and the output will be "PDDDDDDP".

<<<Output>>>
PDDDDDDP
