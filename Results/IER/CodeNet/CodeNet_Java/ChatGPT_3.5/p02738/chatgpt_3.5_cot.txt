<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input, n and m. It then initializes a new instance of the Modular class with m as the modulus. It also initializes a new instance of the Factorial class with n as the limit and the Modular instance as the modular. 

The code then calculates the value of n! using the factorial instance. It then calculates the value of m! using the factorial instance. Finally, it calculates the value of (n-m)! using the factorial instance.

The code then calculates the value of (n! * m! * (n-m)!) % m using the modular instance.

The final result is the calculated value.

<<<Output>>>
The return value would be the calculated value.
