<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable mod is initialized with 998244353.
It initializes variable comb with a new Combination object, which is constructed with a new Factorial object.
Inside the solve method, it initializes variable ans with 0.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n. In each iteration, it adds the value of f(n, i + zero) to variable ans.
Inside the f method, it checks if the value of f[i][j] is already calculated. If not, it calculates it recursively.
If i is 0, it returns 1 if j is equal to zero, otherwise it returns 0.
If i is less than 0 or j is out of range, it returns 0.
Otherwise, it calculates f(i - 1, j - 1), f(i - 2, j + 1) and f(i - 3, j) recursively and stores the results in f[i][j].
Finally, it returns the value of f[i][j].
Inside the pick2 method, it returns the product of n and (n - 1).
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable ans as output.
