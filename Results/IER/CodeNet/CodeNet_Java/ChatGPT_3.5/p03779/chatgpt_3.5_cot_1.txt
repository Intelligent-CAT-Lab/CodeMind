The variable x is initialized with 6 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 99999 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of x is less than or equal to i * (i + 1) / 2. If it is, it assigns the current value of i to variable ans and breaks out of the loop.
In this case, when i is 3, the condition is met because 6 is less than or equal to 3 * (3 + 1) / 2 = 6.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
