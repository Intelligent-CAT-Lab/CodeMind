<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 5 integers as input: H1, M1, H2, M2, and K.
It calculates the start time in minutes by multiplying H1 by 60 and adding M1.
It calculates the end time in minutes by multiplying H2 by 60 and adding M2.
It subtracts K from the difference between the end time and the start time.
Finally, it prints the result as output.
In this case, the start time is 10:00 (600 minutes) and the end time is 15:00 (900 minutes). The difference is 300 minutes. Subtracting K (30 minutes) from the difference gives us 270 minutes.
<<<Output>>>
270
