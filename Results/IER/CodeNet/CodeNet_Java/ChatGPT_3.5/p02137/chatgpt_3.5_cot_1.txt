<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable p.
Then it performs an arithmetic operation p / 500 * 500, which divides the value of p by 500 and then multiplies the result by 500.
The result of this operation is then printed as the output.
In this case, the input is 5700. When we divide 5700 by 500, the result is 11.4. However, since both p and 500 are integers, the division operation will perform integer division, which means the decimal part will be truncated.
So, the result of p / 500 will be 11. And when we multiply 11 by 500, the result is 5500.
Therefore, the output of the code execution will be 5500.
<<<Output>>>
5500
