<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable p. Then it performs an arithmetic operation by dividing p by 500 and multiplying the result by 500. The result of this operation is then printed as the output.
In this case, the input value is 5700. When 5700 is divided by 500, the result is 11.4. However, since both p and 500 are integers, the division operation will perform integer division, which means the decimal part will be truncated. So the result of the division will be 11. Multiplying 11 by 500 gives the final result of 5500.
<<<Output>>>
5500
