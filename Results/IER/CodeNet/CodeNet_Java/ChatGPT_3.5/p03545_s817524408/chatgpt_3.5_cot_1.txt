<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts each character of the string to an integer. It then performs various arithmetic operations on these integers to check if any combination of operations results in the sum of 7. If a combination is found, it prints the equation. 

In this case, the input string is "1222". The code converts each character to an integer: a=1, b=2, c=2, d=2. It then checks all possible combinations of arithmetic operations to see if any of them result in the sum of 7. 

The first condition (a+b+c+d==7) is not met because 1+2+2+2=7. 

The second condition (a+b+c-d==7) is not met because 1+2+2-2=3. 

The third condition (a+b-c+d==7) is not met because 1+2-2+2=3. 

The fourth condition (a-b+c+d==7) is met because 1-2+2+2=3. 

Therefore, the output of the code execution would be "1-2+2+2=7".

<<<Output>>>
1-2+2+2=7
