<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable result is initialized with 1 and the variable src is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of result by 10 and takes the modulo of mod. It also multiplies the current value of src by 9 and takes the modulo of mod.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of result by subtracting src from result, taking the modulo of mod, and then multiplying the result by 2 and taking the modulo of mod.
Then it initializes the variable result2 with 1 and the variable src2 with 1.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of result2 by 10 and takes the modulo of mod. It also multiplies the current value of src2 by 8 and takes the modulo of mod.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of result2 by subtracting src2 from result2 and taking the modulo of mod.
Finally, it calculates the value of result by subtracting result2 from result and taking the modulo of mod. If the value of result is negative, it adds mod to result before printing it. Otherwise, it prints the value of result.
