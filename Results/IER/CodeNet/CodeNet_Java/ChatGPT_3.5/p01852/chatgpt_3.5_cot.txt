<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an input integer n using the Scanner class. It initializes a variable count to 0.
If n is greater than 0, it enters a while loop. In each iteration of the loop, it divides n by 2 and increments the count by 1. This continues until n becomes less than 2.
After the loop, it increments the count by 1 again.
Finally, it prints the value of count as the output.
In this case, the input value is 0, which is not greater than 0. Therefore, the code does not enter the while loop and directly prints the value of count as 0.
<<<Output>>>
