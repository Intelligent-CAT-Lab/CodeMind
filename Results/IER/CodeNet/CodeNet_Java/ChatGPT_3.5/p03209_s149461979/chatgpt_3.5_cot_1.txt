The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable x is initialized with 7 according to the input.
A HashMap array called cache is created with size n+1.
Then it calls the count() method passing n, x, and cache as arguments.
Inside the count() method, it checks for base cases:
- If n is 0, it returns 1.
- If x is 1, it returns 0.
- If the cache already contains the value for the current n and x, it returns that value.
Then it calculates the value of layers_n_1, which is (2^(n+1)) - 3.
Then it calculates the value of ans based on the value of x:
- If x is greater than 2 + layers_n_1, it calculates ans as 1 + count(n-1, x - layers_n_1 - 2, cache) + count(n-1, layers_n_1, cache).
- If x is equal to 2 + layers_n_1, it calculates ans as 1 + count(n-1, layers_n_1, cache).
- Otherwise, it calculates ans as count(n-1, x-1, cache).
Finally, it stores the calculated ans in the cache for the current n and x and returns ans.
After the count() method returns, it prints the final value of ans as the output.
