<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then checks the length of the array. If the length is 1, it prints "-1 -1" and returns. If the length is 2, it checks if the two characters are the same. If they are, it prints "1 2" and returns. If they are not, it prints "-1 -1" and returns. 

If the length is greater than 2, it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to the length of the array - 1. Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is equal to the previous character, the next character, or the previous character is equal to the next character. If any of these conditions are true, it prints the current index and the next index (i+1) and returns.

If none of the conditions are met, it prints "-1 -1" and returns.

<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
