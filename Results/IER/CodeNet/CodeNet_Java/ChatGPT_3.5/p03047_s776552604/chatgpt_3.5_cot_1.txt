<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and k, using the Scanner class. It then calculates the difference between n and k and adds 1 to it. Finally, it prints the result as output.
In this case, n is 3 and k is 2. So, the difference between n and k is 1. Adding 1 to it gives us the final result of 2.
<<<Output>>>
