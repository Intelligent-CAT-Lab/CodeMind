<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and checks if the first character of the string is equal to the last character of the string. If they are equal, it checks the length of the string. If the length is odd, it prints "Second". If the length is even, it prints "First". If the first and last characters are not equal, it also checks the length of the string. If the length is odd, it prints "First". If the length is even, it prints "Second".
In this case, the input string is "aba". The first and last characters are equal, and the length of the string is odd. Therefore, the output will be "Second".
<<<Output>>>
Second
