<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4 and variable K is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-2 (3 times) to calculate the value of ans.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by adding ans divided by (K-1) and 1 to itself. The value of ans is updated in each iteration.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
