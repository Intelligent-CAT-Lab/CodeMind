<<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, W, h, and w are initialized with 3, 3, 2, and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w. If both conditions are true, it prints "No" and returns.
Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
Then it initializes a 2D array a with dimensions H x W.
It iterates through the array a and sets the value of a[i][j] to 1_000_000_000 - 1 if i and j are divisible by h and w respectively.
It also sets the value of a[i + h - 1][j + w - 1] to -1_000_000_000 if i + h - 1 is less than H and j + w - 1 is less than W.
Finally, it prints the values of the array a.
<<<Output>>>

1000000000 -1000000000 1000000000
