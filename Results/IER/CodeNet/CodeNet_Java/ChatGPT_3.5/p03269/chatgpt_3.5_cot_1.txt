<<<Analysis>>>
The variable l is initialized with 4 according to the input. And variable k is initialized with the same value as l. Variable t is initialized with 1 and variable count is initialized with 1. An ArrayList called ans is created to store strings.
It enters a while loop and it continues until the value of l is greater than 1. Inside the loop, it checks if the least significant bit of l is 1 by using bitwise AND operation with 1. If it is 1, it subtracts the value of t from k and adds a string to the ans ArrayList in the format of "count 20 k". Then it adds another string to the ans ArrayList in the format of "count count+1 t". It increments the value of count by 1, right shifts the value of l by 1 bit, and multiplies the value of t by 2.
After the loop finishes, it prints "20 ans.size()+19" as the first line of output. Then it prints 19 lines of output in the format of "(i+1) (i+2) 0" for i from 0 to 18. Finally, it prints each string in the ans ArrayList as separate lines of output.
