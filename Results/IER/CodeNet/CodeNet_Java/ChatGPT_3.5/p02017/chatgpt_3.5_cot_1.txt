<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: h, w, x, and y. The values of these variables are initialized with the input values.
Then it checks if the product of h and w is odd and the sum of x and y is odd. If both conditions are true, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, h * w = 3 * 5 = 15, which is odd. And x + y = 1 + 4 = 5, which is odd. So both conditions are true and the output will be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
