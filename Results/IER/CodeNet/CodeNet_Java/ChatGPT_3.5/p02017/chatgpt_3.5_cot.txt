<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: h, w, x, and y. It then checks two conditions:
1. If the product of h and w is odd (h * w % 2 == 1) and the sum of x and y is odd ((x + y) % 2 == 1), it prints "No".
2. Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

In this case, the input values are h = 3, w = 5, x = 1, and y = 4.
The product of h and w is 15, which is odd. The sum of x and y is 5, which is also odd.
Therefore, both conditions are true, and the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
