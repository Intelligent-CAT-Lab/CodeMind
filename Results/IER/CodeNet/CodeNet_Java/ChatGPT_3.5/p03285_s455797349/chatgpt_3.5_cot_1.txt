<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 11 according to the input.
It enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to 100/7 = 14, and the inner loop iterates from 0 to 100/4 = 25.
Inside the nested loop, it checks if the current value of N is equal to (i * 7) + (j * 4). If it is, it prints "Yes" and returns from the main method.
The condition is met when i is 1 and j is 2, because (1 * 7) + (2 * 4) = 11.
If the condition is not met after the nested loop finishes, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
