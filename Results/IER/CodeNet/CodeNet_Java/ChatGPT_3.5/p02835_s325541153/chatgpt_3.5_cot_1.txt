<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input using the Scanner class and assigns them to variables a, b, and c respectively. 
Then it checks if the sum of a, b, and c is greater than or equal to 22. If it is, it prints "bust". Otherwise, it prints "win".
In this case, the sum of 5, 7, and 9 is 21, which is less than 22. So the output will be "win".
<<<Output>>>
win
