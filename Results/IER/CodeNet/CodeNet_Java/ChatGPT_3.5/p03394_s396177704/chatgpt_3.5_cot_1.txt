<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It creates an instance of FastScanner class to read the input.
It calls the solve() method to get the answer array.
Inside the solve() method, it initializes the variable maxOdd with 0.
It enters a for loop from 3 to 30000 and checks if the current number n is odd and divisible by either 3 or 5. If it is, it increments the variable maxOdd.
After the loop, it divides the variable maxOdd by 2 and multiplies it by 2 to get the maximum number of odd numbers that can be included in the answer array.
Then it initializes the variables odd and even based on the value of N and maxOdd.
If N is greater than maxOdd, it assigns maxOdd to odd and N - maxOdd to even.
Otherwise, if N is even, it assigns N - 2 to odd and 2 to even. If N is odd, it assigns N - 1 to odd and 1 to even.
Then it initializes an array ans of size N to store the answer.
It initializes the variable all with 0 and the variable i with 0.
It enters a for loop from 2 to 30000 and checks if the current number n is odd and divisible by either 3 or 5. If it is, it adds n to the ans array, increments the variable i, adds n to the variable all, and decrements the variable odd. If odd becomes 0, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop, it enters another for loop from 2 to 30000 and increments n by 2 in each iteration. It adds n to the ans array, increments the variable i, adds n to the variable all, and decrements the variable even. If even becomes 0, it breaks out of the loop.
Then it enters a while loop that continues until the sum of all the numbers in the ans array is divisible by both 3 and 5. In each iteration, it adds 2 to the variable all and 2 to the last element of the ans array.
Finally, it sorts the ans array in ascending order and returns it as the answer.
Back in the main method, it creates an instance of PrintWriter class to print the output.
It calls the solve() method to get the answer array and stores it in the variable answer.
It enters a for loop from 0 to N-1 and prints each element of the answer array separated by a space.
Then it prints a new line and flushes the PrintWriter.
