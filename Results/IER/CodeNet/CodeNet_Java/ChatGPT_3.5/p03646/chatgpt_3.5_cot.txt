<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a method called `solve()` which is the main function of the program. Inside the `solve()` method, it performs the following steps:
1. Reads an input value `K` using the `nextLong()` method.
2. Initializes a variable `N` with the value 50.
3. Creates an array `list` of size `N` to store the values.
4. Iterates from 0 to `N-1` and assigns `K/N + i` to each element of the `list` array.
5. If `K % N` is not zero, it enters a loop and performs the following steps:
   a. Increments the value of `list[i % N]` by `N + 1`.
   b. Decrements the value of each element in the `list` array by 1.
6. Prints the value of `N`.
7. Converts each element of the `list` array to a string and stores them in the `output` array.
8. Prints the elements of the `output` array joined by a space.
