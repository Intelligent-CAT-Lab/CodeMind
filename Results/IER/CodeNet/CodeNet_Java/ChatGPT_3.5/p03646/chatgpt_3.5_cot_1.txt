The variable K is initialized with 0 according to the input. And variable N is initialized with 50. An array list of long type named list is created with size N.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1. In each iteration, it assigns the value of K divided by N plus i to the i-th element of list.
After the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to K modulo N - 1. In each iteration, it adds N + 1 to the i-th element of list and then subtracts 1 from each element of list.
After the second for loop, it prints the value of N and then it converts each element of list to a string and stores them in an array named output.
Finally, it prints the elements of output array with a space as separator.
