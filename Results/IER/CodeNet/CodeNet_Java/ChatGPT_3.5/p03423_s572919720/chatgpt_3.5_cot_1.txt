<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer n from the input. If n is less than 3, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the result by dividing n by 3 and prints the result.
In this case, n is 8, which is not less than 3. So the result is calculated as 8/3 = 2.6666. However, since the result is an integer, the decimal part is truncated and the final result is 2.
