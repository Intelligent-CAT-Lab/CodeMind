<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 and variable K is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It checks if K is divisible by 2. Since 2 is divisible by 2, the condition is true.
It calculates the value of c1 by dividing N by K, which is 3/2 = 1.
It calculates the value of c2 by dividing N by (K/2), which is 3/(2/2) = 3/1 = 3 - 1 = 2.
It prints the value of c1 * c1 * c1 + c2 * c2 * c2, which is 1 * 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 * 2 = 1 + 8 = 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
