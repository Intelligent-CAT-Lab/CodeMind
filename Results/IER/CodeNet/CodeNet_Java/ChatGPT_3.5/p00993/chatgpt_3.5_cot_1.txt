<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a BigInteger variable fact with the value 1 and another BigInteger variable mul with the value 1.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to 1510. In each iteration, it multiplies the value of fact with the value of mul and assigns the result to fact. Then it increments the value of mul by 1.
After the for loop, it adds the value 2 to the variable fact.
Then it enters a while loop that checks if there is another integer input. If there is, it reads the input and assigns it to the variable n. Then it prints the value of fact.
After that, it enters another for loop that iterates from 2 to 2 + n. In each iteration, it prints the value of i.
The while loop continues to execute as long as there is another integer input.
So, for the given input of 2, the code will print the value of fact once and then print the values 2 and 3 in separate lines.
