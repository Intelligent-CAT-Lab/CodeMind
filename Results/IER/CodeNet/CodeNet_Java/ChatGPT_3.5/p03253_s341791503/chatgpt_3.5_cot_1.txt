The variable N is initialized with 2 and variable M is initialized with 6 according to the input. 
Then it calls the function fra(M, unko) passing the value of M and the list unko as arguments. 
Inside the function fra, it finds the prime factors of M and adds them to the list unko. In this case, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so the list unko will contain [2, 3].
After that, it initializes a 2D array called map with size 65x2 and fills it with zeros.
Then it initializes a variable counter with 0 and a boolean variable zumi with false.
It enters a while loop that continues until the size of the list unko becomes 0.
Inside the loop, it retrieves the first element from the list unko and removes it from the list. It assigns this value to the variable a.
Then it sets the variable zumi to false.
It enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to the value of counter.
Inside the loop, it checks if the value of a is equal to the value at map[i][0] and a is not equal to 1. If it is, it increments the value at map[i][1] by 1, sets zumi to true, and breaks out of the loop.
If the value of a is not equal to 1 and zumi is still false, it assigns the value of a to map[counter][0], increments the value at map[counter][1] by 1, and increments the value of counter by 1.
If the value of a is equal to 1, it does nothing.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to the value of counter.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of cmb using the Combi function and the values from map[i][1] and N-1. It then multiplies the current value of ans by cmb and takes the modulo 1000000007. The result is assigned back to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
