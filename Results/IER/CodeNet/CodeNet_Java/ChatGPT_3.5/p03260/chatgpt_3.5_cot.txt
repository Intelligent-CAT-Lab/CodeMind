<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It then checks if the product of n and k is odd or even. If it is odd, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, n = 3 and k = 1. The product of n and k is 3*1 = 3, which is odd.
Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
