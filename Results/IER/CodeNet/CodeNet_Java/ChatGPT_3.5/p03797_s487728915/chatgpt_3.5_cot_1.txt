The variable n is initialized with 1 and variable m is initialized with 6 according to the input. Variable c is initialized with 0.
It checks if the condition n * 2 <= m is true. In this case, it is true because 1 * 2 = 2 and 2 <= 6. So it enters the if block.
Inside the if block, it assigns the value of n to c, which is 1. Then it subtracts n * 2 from m, which is 6 - 2 = 4.
After the if block, it adds the value of m / 4 to c. In this case, m / 4 is 4 / 4 = 1. So c becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
Finally, it prints the value of c, which is 2, as the output.
<<<Output>>>
