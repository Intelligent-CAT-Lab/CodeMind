<<<Analysis>>>
The variable cnt is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable power is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of power by multiplying the current value of power with i and then taking the modulo with (10^9 + 7).
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable power as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
