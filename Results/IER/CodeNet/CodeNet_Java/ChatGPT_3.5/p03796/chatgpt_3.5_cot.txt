The variable cnt is initialized with the value 3 according to the input. The variable power is initialized with the value 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of power with the current value of i and takes the modulo of the result with Math.pow(10, 9) + 7.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of power as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
