<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and splits it into an array of individual characters. It then checks if the second and third characters are equal and if either the first character is equal to the second character or the second character is equal to the fourth character. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the input string is "1118". After splitting it, the array will contain the characters "1", "1", "1", and "8". The second and third characters are both "1", and the first character is also "1". Therefore, both conditions are true and the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
