<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input S. It initializes a string variable ans with "No".
Then it checks if the string S contains the characters "N", "S", "E", and "W" using the contains() method. If it does, it updates the value of ans to "Yes".
Next, it checks if the string S contains only "N" and "S" but not "E" and "W". If it does, it updates the value of ans to "Yes".
Finally, it checks if the string S contains only "E" and "W" but not "N" and "S". If it does, it updates the value of ans to "Yes".
After all the conditions are checked, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the string S is "SENW", which contains all the characters "N", "S", "E", and "W". Therefore, the value of ans will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
