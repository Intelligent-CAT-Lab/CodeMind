<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable `num`. It then initializes a variable `i` to 0.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 99. In each iteration, it checks if `num` is greater than or equal to `2^i - 1`, where `^` represents exponentiation. If the condition is true, it continues to the next iteration. If the condition is false, it breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it prints the value of `i-1` as the output.
In this case, the input is 2. The loop will iterate until `i` becomes 2, because `2^2 - 1 = 3`, which is greater than 2. So, the loop will break when `i` becomes 2. Therefore, the output will be 1.
