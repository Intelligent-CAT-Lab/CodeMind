<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable m, variable k are initialized with 3, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It initializes two arrays fact and ifact with size n+1 and sets the first two elements of both arrays to 1.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 0 to k. In each iteration, it calculates the value of ans by adding the product of three values: m, modPow(m-1, n-(i+1), mod), and NcR(n-1, i). The value of ans is updated in each iteration.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output.
