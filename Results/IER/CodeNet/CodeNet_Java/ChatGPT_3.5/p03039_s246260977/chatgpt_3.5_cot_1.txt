<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers n, m, and k as input. It then initializes the variables mod, dist, temp, up, and down with 1000000007, 0, 0, 1, and 1 respectively.
It enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to n. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of temp by multiplying i with (n-i) and takes the modulo with mod.
It then adds the value of temp multiplied by (m*m)%mod to dist and takes the modulo with mod.
It then resets the value of temp to 0.
It enters another for loop and iterates from 1 to m. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of temp by multiplying i with (m-i) and takes the modulo with mod.
It then adds the value of temp multiplied by (n*n)%mod to dist and takes the modulo with mod.
It then calculates the value of up by multiplying it with i and takes the modulo with mod.
It then calculates the value of down by multiplying it with i and takes the modulo with mod.
It then calculates the value of downinv by calling the power function with parameters down, mod-2, and mod.
Finally, it prints the value of (dist * ((up * downinv) % mod)) % mod as the output.
