<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class Solver which has a constructor and a main method. 
In the main method, it initializes a BigInteger variable m with the value 1. 
Then it enters a for loop which iterates from 0 to 1499. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of m with the current value of i+2. 
After the for loop, it adds 2 to the value of m. 
Then it enters a while loop which checks if there is more input. Inside the while loop, it reads an integer n from the input and prints the value of m. 
Then it enters another for loop which iterates from 0 to n-1. In each iteration, it prints the value of i+2. 
The while loop continues until there is no more input.
