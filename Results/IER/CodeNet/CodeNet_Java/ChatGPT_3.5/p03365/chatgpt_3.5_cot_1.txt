<<<Analysis>>>
The variable i is initialized with 4 according to the input. Then an array md of size i is created.
Then it enters a while loop where it calculates the values of md array. It starts with rm = i - 2 and lx = i - 2.
Inside the loop, it calculates md[lx + 1] by calling a function Util.c(rm, lx) and stores it in md array.
Then it decrements rm by 2 and lx by 1.
The loop continues until rm becomes less than 0.
After the loop, it initializes two variables res and prev with 0.
Then it enters a for loop which iterates from 1 to i-1.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of cur by multiplying the factorial of m, factorial of (i-m-1) and md[m].
Then it calculates the value of res by adding (cur - prev + Util._m) * m % Util._m to it.
Then it updates the value of prev with cur.
After the loop, it prints the value of res % Util._m as output.
