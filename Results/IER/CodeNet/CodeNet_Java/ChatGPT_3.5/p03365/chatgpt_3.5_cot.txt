<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `i` and performs a series of calculations to determine the return value. 

First, it initializes an array `md` of size `i` and sets `rm` to `i - 2` and `lx` to `i - 2`. 

Then, it enters a while loop that iterates as long as `rm` is greater than or equal to 0. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of `md[lx + 1]` using a method `Util.c(rm, lx)`. It then decrements `rm` by 2 and decrements `lx` by 1.

After the while loop, it initializes `res` to 0 and `prev` to 0. 

Next, it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to `i - 1`. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of `cur` using the `Util.fact` method and the `md` array. It then updates `res` by adding `(cur - prev + Util._m) * m % Util._m` and updates `prev` to `cur`.

Finally, it prints `res % Util._m` as the return value.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of `4` would be `0`.
