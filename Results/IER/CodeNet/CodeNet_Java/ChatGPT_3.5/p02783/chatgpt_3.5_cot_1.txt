<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user using the Scanner class. It reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings using the space character as the delimiter. The first element of the array is assigned to the variable h and the second element is assigned to the variable a.

Then, it calculates the value of n by dividing h by a. If there is a remainder (h%a > 0), it increments n by 1.

Finally, it prints the value of n as the output.

In this case, the input is "10 4". So, h = 10 and a = 4.

n = 10/4 = 2.5

Since there is a remainder (10%4 = 2), n is incremented by 1.

So, the output will be 3.
