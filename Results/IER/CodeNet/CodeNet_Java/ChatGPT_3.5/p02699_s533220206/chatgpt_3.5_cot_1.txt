<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class. It compares the first integer with the second integer using the ">" operator. If the first integer is greater than the second integer, it prints "safe". Otherwise, it prints "unsafe".
In this case, the first integer is 4 and the second integer is 5. Since 4 is not greater than 5, the code will print "unsafe".
<<<Output>>>
unsafe
