<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the console. Then it reads two integers n and m from the input.
It calculates the value of the variable base by multiplying n by 100 and m by 1800 and adding them together.
Finally, it prints the result of shifting the bits of base to the left by m positions.
In this case, the input is "1 1", so n = 1 and m = 1.
The value of base would be 100 + 1800 = 1900.
Shifting the bits of 1900 to the left by 1 position would result in 3800.
<<<Output>>>
3800
