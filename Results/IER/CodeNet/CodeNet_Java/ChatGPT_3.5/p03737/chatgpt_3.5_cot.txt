<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using the Scanner class. It expects three inputs, each consisting of a single word. For each input, it takes the first character, converts it to uppercase using the Character.toUpperCase() method, and then prints it. Finally, it prints a new line character.

In this case, the input "atcoder beginner contest" will be read as three separate inputs: "atcoder", "beginner", and "contest". For each input, the code will take the first character, convert it to uppercase, and print it. Therefore, the output will be "ABC".

<<<Output>>>
ABC
