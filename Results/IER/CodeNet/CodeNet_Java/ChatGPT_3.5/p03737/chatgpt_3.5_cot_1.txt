<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input string using a Scanner object. It then enters a for loop that iterates 3 times. In each iteration, it reads the next word from the input string using the `next()` method of the Scanner object. It then converts the first character of the word to uppercase using the `toUpperCase()` method of the Character class and prints it. After the loop finishes, it prints a new line character.

So, for the given input "atcoder beginner contest", the code will print "ABC" as the output.

<<<Output>>>
ABC
