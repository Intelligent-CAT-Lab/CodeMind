The variables h, w, a, and b are initialized with 2, 3, 1, and 1 respectively according to the input.
A new BinomialCalculator object c is created with the sum of h and w as the first parameter and MiscUtils.MOD7 as the second parameter.
A variable answer is initialized with 0.
A for loop is executed h-a times. In this case, the loop will run once.
Inside the loop, it calculates the binomial coefficient using the c.c() method and adds it to the answer variable.
The loop ends and the answer is printed as the output.
