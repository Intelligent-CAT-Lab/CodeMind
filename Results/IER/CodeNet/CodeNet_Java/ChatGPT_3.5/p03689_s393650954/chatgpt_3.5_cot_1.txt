<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: hL, wL, hS, and wS. It then calls the solve() method passing these four integers as arguments.
Inside the solve() method, it initializes a variable "limit" with the value 1_000_000_000. It then calculates the values of "positiveElement" and "negativeElement" based on the given formulas.
Next, it calculates the values of "countH" and "countW" by dividing hL and wL by hS and wS respectively. It also calculates the values of "restH" and "restW" by taking the remainder of hL and wL divided by hS and wS respectively.
Then, it calculates the values of "count" and "rest" based on the given formulas.
If the value of "positiveElement * rest - count" is less than or equal to 0, it returns a list containing the string "No".
Otherwise, it creates a new ArrayList called "output" and adds the string "Yes" to it.
Then, it enters a nested for loop to iterate over the values of i and j. Inside the loop, it checks if the current values of i and j satisfy the condition "i % hS == hS - 1 && j % wS == wS - 1". If it does, it appends the value of "negativeElement" to a StringBuilder object called "sb". Otherwise, it appends the value of "positiveElement" to "sb".
After the loop finishes, it adds the string representation of "sb" to the "output" list.
Finally, it returns the "output" list.
The execute() method takes the input values from the reader and passes them to the solve() method. It then prints each line of the output list.
In the main() method, it creates a ContestReader object to read the input, a PrintWriter object to write the output, and calls the execute() method passing the reader and writer objects.
