<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
Then it initializes three arrays: factorial, inverse, and factorial_inverse, all with size n+1.
It sets the initial values of these arrays as follows:
- factorial[0] = 1
- factorial[1] = 1
- inverse[1] = 1
- factorial_inverse[0] = 1
- factorial_inverse[1] = 1

Then it enters a for loop from i=2 to n and calculates the values of factorial[i], inverse[i], and factorial_inverse[i] using the previous values in the arrays.

After that, it initializes the variable answer as 0.

Then it checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, it prints n * (n - 1) and returns.

If k is greater than n - 1, it sets k to n - 1.

Then it enters another for loop from i=0 to k and calculates the values of combination and combination2 using the factorial, inverse, and factorial_inverse arrays.

Finally, it updates the value of answer by adding the product of combination and combination2 modulo MOD.

Then it prints the final value of answer.
