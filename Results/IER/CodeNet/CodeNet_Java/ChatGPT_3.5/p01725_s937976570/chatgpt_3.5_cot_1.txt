<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "3-2*3". The code first initializes the variable s with the input string and appends "=" to the end of the string. Then it initializes the variable now with 0 and the variable max with the minimum long value.

The code then calculates the maximum value of different expressions using the expression() method. It calls the expression() method with different combinations of three operators: '+', '-', and '*'. The expression() method evaluates the expression by calling the factor() method and performs the calculations based on the operators.

The factor() method checks if the current character is '('. If it is, it recursively calls the expression() method and returns the result. Otherwise, it calls the number() method to parse the number and returns it.

The expression12() and term12() methods are similar to the expression() and term() methods, but they only consider the operators '+', '-', and '*'. The expression21() and term21() methods are similar to the expression() and term() methods, but they only consider the operators '+', '-', and '*'. The ex1(), ex2(), and ex3() methods are similar to the expression() method, but they only consider two operators at a time.

The number() method parses the number from the input string by iterating through the characters and converting them to a long value.

The cal() method performs the calculation based on the operator.

Finally, the code prints the maximum value calculated from different expressions.
