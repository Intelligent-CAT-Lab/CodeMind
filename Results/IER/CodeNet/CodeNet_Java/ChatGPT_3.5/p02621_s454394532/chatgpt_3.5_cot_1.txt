<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in variable a. Then it calculates the value of a + a * a + a * a * a and prints it as the output.
In this case, the input is 2. So the value of a is 2. 
The calculation would be: 2 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 2 * 2 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
