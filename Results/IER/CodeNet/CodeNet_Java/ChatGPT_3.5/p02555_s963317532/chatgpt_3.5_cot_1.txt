The variable s is initialized with 7 according to the input. And variable dp is initialized as an array of size s+1 with all elements set to 0. The variable mod is set to 1_000_000_007.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to s-1 to check each integer i in this range. Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 3 to s to check each integer j in this range.
It checks if the sum of i and j is less than or equal to s. If it is, it updates the value of dp[i+j] by adding the current value of dp[i] to it and taking the modulo mod.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of dp[s] as output.
