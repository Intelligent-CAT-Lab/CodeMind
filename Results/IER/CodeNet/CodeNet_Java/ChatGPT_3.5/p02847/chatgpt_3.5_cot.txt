<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `in` which represents a day of the week. It then searches for the index of the input string in the `days` array. If the input string is found, the index is stored in the variable `idx`. 

The code then calculates the difference between 6 and `idx`, adds 7 to the result, and takes the modulo 7. This is done to ensure that the result is always positive and falls within the range of 0 to 6. The result is stored in the variable `ans`.

If `ans` is equal to 0, it means that the input string represents Sunday. In this case, the code prints 7 as the output. Otherwise, it prints the value of `ans` as the output.
