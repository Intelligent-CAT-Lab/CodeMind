<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It then creates an instance of the Combinatrics class and initializes it with the value of k. 
The Combinatrics class contains various methods for calculating combinations, permutations, and other combinatorial operations. 
The code then calls the surjection method of the Combinatrics class with the values of n and k as arguments. 
The surjection method calculates the number of surjections from a set of size n to a set of size k. 
It uses a loop to iterate from 1 to k and calculates the sum of combinations of k elements taken i at a time multiplied by the power of i raised to the power of n. 
The sign of the sum alternates between positive and negative depending on whether k is even or odd. 
The result is then printed as the output.
