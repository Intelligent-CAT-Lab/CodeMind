<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It then creates an instance of the Combinatrics class and calls the surjection method with n and k as arguments. The surjection method calculates the number of surjections from a set of size n to a set of size k. It uses the combination method from the Combinatrics class to calculate the combinations and the iterationPow method to calculate the power of a number. The result is then returned as the output.
