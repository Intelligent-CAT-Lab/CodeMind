The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input. And variable i is initialized with 1 and variable d is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is multiplied with variable d and the result is stored in variable d.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable d as output, which is 120.
