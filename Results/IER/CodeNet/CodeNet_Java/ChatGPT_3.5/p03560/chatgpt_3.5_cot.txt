<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `K` and initializes an array `dp` of size `K` with all elements set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
Then it creates a class `Node` with two variables `to` and `cost` and initializes a priority queue `que` with a custom comparator that compares the `cost` of two nodes.
Next, it iterates from 1 to the minimum of 10 and `K` and sets the corresponding element in `dp` to the current index `i` and adds a new `Node` to the priority queue with `to` and `cost` set to `i`.
Then it enters a while loop that continues until the priority queue is empty. In each iteration, it removes the node with the minimum `cost` from the priority queue.
It checks if the `cost` of the current node is greater than the value in `dp` at index `v`. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it iterates from 0 to 9 and calculates the next vertex `nextv` and the next cost `nextc` based on the current vertex `v` and the current digit `i`.
If the `nextc` is less than the value in `dp` at index `nextv`, it updates the value in `dp` at index `nextv` to `nextc` and adds a new `Node` to the priority queue with `to` and `cost` set to `nextv` and `nextc` respectively.
Finally, it prints the value in `dp` at index 0 as the output.
