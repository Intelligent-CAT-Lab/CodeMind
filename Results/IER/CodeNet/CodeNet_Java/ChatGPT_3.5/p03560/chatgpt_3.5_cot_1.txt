The variable K is initialized with 6 according to the input. And an array dp of size K is initialized with Integer.MAX_VALUE.
A class Node is defined with two variables to and cost. A PriorityQueue que is created with a custom comparator that compares the cost of two nodes.
A for loop is used to initialize the dp array with values from 1 to 9 and add corresponding nodes to the PriorityQueue que.
Then a while loop is used to process the nodes in the PriorityQueue que. It takes the node with the minimum cost and updates the dp array and adds new nodes to the PriorityQueue que.
The loop continues until the PriorityQueue que is empty.
Finally, it prints the value of dp[0] as output.
