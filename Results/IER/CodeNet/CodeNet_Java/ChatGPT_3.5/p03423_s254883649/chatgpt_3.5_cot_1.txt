<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 8 according to the input. And variables n2 and n3 are initialized with the values of N divided by 2 and N divided by 3 respectively. The variable amari is initialized with the remainder of N divided by 3.
Then it checks the value of amari. If it is 0, 1 or 2, it prints the value of N divided by 3.
In this case, the value of amari is 2, so it will print the value of N divided by 3, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
