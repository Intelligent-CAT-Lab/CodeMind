<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable K and variable M are initialized with 3, 2 and 7 respectively according to the input. And variable MASK is initialized with (1 << K) - 1.
It checks if N is less than K. If it is, it calls the naive() method and prints its return value as output. Otherwise, it continues with the rest of the code.
It initializes a 3D array dp with dimensions [2][K + 1][1 << K].
It then iterates over all possible values of i from 0 to (1 << K) - 1 and checks if the current value of i satisfies certain conditions. If it does, it sets the corresponding element in dp[0] to 1.
Next, it enters a for loop that iterates from K to 2 * N - 1. In each iteration, it updates the values in dp[t] based on the values in dp[1 - t] and the current value of i.
Finally, it calculates the sum of all elements in dp[1 - t][0] and prints the result modulo M as output.
