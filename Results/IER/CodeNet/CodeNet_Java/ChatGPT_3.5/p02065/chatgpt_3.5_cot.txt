<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: N, K, and M. It then initializes a variable MASK as (1 << K) - 1. If N is less than K, it calls the `naive()` method and returns its result. Otherwise, it initializes a 3D array called `dp` with dimensions [2][K + 1][1 << K]. It then iterates over all possible values of i from 0 to (1 << K) - 1 and checks if the binary representation of i has a valid pattern. If it does, it sets the corresponding element in `dp` to 1. 

Next, it enters a loop that iterates from K to 2 * N - 1. In each iteration, it updates the `dp` array based on the previous values. It then calculates the final answer by summing up all the values in the last row of `dp` and taking the modulo M.

Finally, it prints the final answer.

The `naive()` method is a recursive method that calculates the answer using a naive approach. It maintains two lists, `u` and `l`, which represent the upper and lower rows respectively. It recursively tries all possible combinations of rows and returns the total count.
