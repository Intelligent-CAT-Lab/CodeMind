<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It initializes a stack called "elements" and pushes 0 onto it. It also initializes another stack called "elementsBefore". It defines three Runnable objects: VALID_UNDO, INVALID_UNDO, and OPEN. It initializes two more stacks: "undo" and "oldStates". It initializes two variables: "depth" and "ans" with 0.

Then, it starts iterating over the characters of the input string. For each character, it performs the following actions:
- If the character is not '-', it pushes the current depth and ans onto the "oldStates" stack.
- If the character is '(', it increments the depth, pushes 0 onto the "elements" stack, and pushes the OPEN runnable onto the "undo" stack.
- If the character is ')', it decrements the depth, pops the top element of the "elements" stack and pushes it onto the "elementsBefore" stack. If the depth becomes negative, it sets the depth to 0, pushes 0 onto the "elements" stack, and pushes the INVALID_UNDO runnable onto the "undo" stack. Otherwise, it increments the top element of the "elements" stack by 1 and pushes the VALID_UNDO runnable onto the "undo" stack. It then calculates the delta as the top element of the "elements" stack and adds it to the "ans" variable.
- If the character is neither '(' nor ')', it pops the top element from the "oldStates" stack and assigns its depth and ans values to the respective variables. It also runs the top runnable from the "undo" stack.

Finally, it prints the value of "ans" after each iteration.
