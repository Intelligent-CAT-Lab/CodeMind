<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c respectively. It also initializes a variable n with the value 3.
Then it checks if a, b, and c are equal. If they are all equal, it subtracts 2 from n. If any two of them are equal, it subtracts 1 from n. If none of them are equal, it does not subtract anything from n.
In this case, a=3, b=1, and c=4. None of them are equal, so n remains unchanged.
Finally, it prints the value of n, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
