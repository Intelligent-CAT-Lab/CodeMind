<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, x and t. It then checks if x is greater than t. If it is, it prints the difference between x and t. If x is not greater than t, it prints "0".
In this case, x=100 and t=17. Since x is greater than t, the code will print the difference between x and t, which is 83.
<<<Output>>>
83
