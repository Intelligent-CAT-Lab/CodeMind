<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. 
Then it creates two arrays min and max of size n+1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to calculate the values of min[i] and max[i] for each i.
min[i] is calculated by adding i to the previous value of min[i-1].
max[i] is calculated by adding (n-i) to the previous value of max[i-1].
After the loop finishes, it initializes the variable ans with 0.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from k-1 to n.
Inside the loop, it adds the difference between max[i] and min[i] to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans modulo 1000000007 as output.
