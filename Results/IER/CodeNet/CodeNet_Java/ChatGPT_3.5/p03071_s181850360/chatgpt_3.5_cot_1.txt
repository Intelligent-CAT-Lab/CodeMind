<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers A and B from the input. It then checks if A is equal to B. If they are equal, it prints the sum of A and B. If A is greater than B, it prints 2A-1. If B is greater than A, it prints 2B-1.
In this case, A=5 and B=3. Since A is greater than B, the code will print 2A-1, which is 2*5-1=9.
<<<Output>>>
9
