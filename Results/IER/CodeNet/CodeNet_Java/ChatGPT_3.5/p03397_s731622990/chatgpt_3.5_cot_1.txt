<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and performs some calculations based on the characters in the string. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid strings that can be formed by replacing the question marks with either 0 or 1. The valid strings are those that have at most two consecutive 1s and at most two consecutive 0s.

The code initializes an array suf[] to store the number of question marks after each position in the string. It then initializes an array pw2[] to store the powers of 2 modulo MOD. It also initializes a 4-dimensional array dp[][][][] to store the number of valid strings that can be formed up to each position in the string.

The code then iterates through each position in the string and updates the dp[][][][] array based on the current character and the previous values in the dp[][][][] array. It calculates the number of valid strings that can be formed by replacing the question marks with 0 or 1 at each position.

Finally, the code calculates the final answer by summing up the values in the dp[][][][] array for the last position in the string.
