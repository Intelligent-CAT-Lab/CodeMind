<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input values for variables w, h, v, t, x, y, p, and q using the UserScanner class.
Then it creates an instance of the Wave class with the input values.
It calls the attack() method of the Wave class, which calculates and returns the attack value.
The attack() method calculates the maximum distance that the wave can travel using the formula maxDist = v * t * v * t.
Then it iterates through different values of mx and my to calculate the distance between the wave and the target.
It checks if the calculated distance is less than or equal to the maximum distance, and if it is, it adds the corresponding value to the answer.
Finally, it returns the answer as the output.
