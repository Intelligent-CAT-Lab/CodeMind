<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user. Then it iterates through each character of the string using a for loop.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is a lowercase letter. If it is, it converts it to uppercase by subtracting the difference between 'a' and 'A' from the character.
If the current character is an uppercase letter, it converts it to lowercase by adding the difference between 'a' and 'A' to the character.
After converting the character, it prints it.
Finally, it prints a new line character.
<<<Output>>>
