<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c respectively.
Then it checks if all three variables are equal using the logical AND operator. Since all three variables are equal to 2, the condition is true.
Therefore, it prints "Yes" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
