<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 15 according to the input. And variable min is initialized with the maximum value of an integer.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 14 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to the digitSum() method.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current integer i and the sum of the digits of (n - i) by calling the digitSum() method.
Then it calculates the sum of these two sums and updates the value of variable min if the current sum is smaller than the current value of min.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable min as output.
