<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It initializes a variable sum with 0.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from a to b. For each iteration, it checks if c is divisible by i (the current value of the loop variable). If it is, it increments the sum variable by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of the sum variable as the output.
In this case, the loop will iterate from 5 to 14. The values of i that divide 80 evenly are 5, 8, and 10. So the sum variable will be incremented 3 times.
