<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input using the Scanner class and stores them in an array called "in". Then it sorts the array in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method. Finally, it checks if the first element of the sorted array is 5, the second element is 5, and the third element is 7. If all these conditions are true, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

In this case, the input is "5 5 7", so the array "in" will be [5, 5, 7]. After sorting, the array remains the same. Therefore, the conditions for "YES" are met and the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
