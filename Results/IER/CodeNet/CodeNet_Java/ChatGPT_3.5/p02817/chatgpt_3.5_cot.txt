<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two strings from the input using the Scanner class. The first string is assigned to the variable "string" and the second string is assigned to the variable "tString". Then, it concatenates the second string and the first string using the "+" operator and prints the result. 

In this case, the input is "oder atc". The first string "oder" is assigned to the variable "string" and the second string "atc" is assigned to the variable "tString". The code then concatenates "atc" and "oder" to get "atcoder" and prints it as the output.

<<<Output>>>
atcoder
