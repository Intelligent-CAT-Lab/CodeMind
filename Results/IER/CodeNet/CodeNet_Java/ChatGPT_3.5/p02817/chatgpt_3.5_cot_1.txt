<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two strings from the input using the Scanner class. The first string is assigned to the variable "string" and the second string is assigned to the variable "tString". Then it prints the concatenation of the second string and the first string using the System.out.println() method. 
In this case, the input is "oder atc". So, the value of "string" will be "oder" and the value of "tString" will be "atc". The code then prints "atcoder" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
atcoder
