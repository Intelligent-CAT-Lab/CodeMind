<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the input. It then checks the following conditions:
- If a is equal to b, it prints "Draw".
- If a is equal to 1, it prints "Alice".
- If b is equal to 1, it prints "Bob".
- If a is less than b, it prints "Bob".
- Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

In this case, a is 8 and b is 6. Since a is greater than b, the condition "a < b" is false. Therefore, the code will print "Alice".

<<<Output>>>
Alice
