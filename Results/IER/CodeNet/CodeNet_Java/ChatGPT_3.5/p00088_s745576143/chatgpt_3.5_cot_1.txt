<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two HashMaps: codeMap and charMap. codeMap maps characters to their corresponding Morse code representation, and charMap maps Morse code strings to their corresponding characters.
The code then reads input from the user using a Scanner object. It reads each line of input and stores it in the variable str.
For each character in the input string, the code retrieves its Morse code representation from the codeMap and appends it to the codeBuf StringBuffer.
If the length of codeBuf is not divisible by 5, the code appends '0' characters to make it divisible by 5.
The code then iterates over codeBuf in increments of 5 and retrieves the corresponding character from the charMap. It prints the character to the console.
After processing all the input lines, the code prints a newline character.
