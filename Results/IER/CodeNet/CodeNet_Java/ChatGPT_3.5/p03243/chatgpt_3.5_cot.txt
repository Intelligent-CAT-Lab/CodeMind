<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable n. It then enters a for loop that starts from the value of n and iterates up to 1000. Inside the loop, it checks if the current value of i is divisible by 111 without any remainder. If it is, it prints the value of i and returns from the main method, terminating the program.

In this case, the code will return the first multiple of 111 that is greater than or equal to the input value n.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of `111` will be the first multiple of 111 that is greater than or equal to the input value n.
