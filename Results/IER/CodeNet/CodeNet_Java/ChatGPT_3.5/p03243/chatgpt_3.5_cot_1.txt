<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 111 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 111 to 1000 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is divisible by 111. If it is, it prints the value of i and then returns, exiting the program.
Since 111 is divisible by 111, the output of the code execution would be 111.
<<<Output>>>
111
