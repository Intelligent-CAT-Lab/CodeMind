<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then checks if the character at index 2 is equal to the character at index 3, and if the character at index 4 is equal to the character at index 5. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input string is "sippuu". The character at index 2 is 'p' and the character at index 3 is 'p', which are equal. Similarly, the character at index 4 is 'u' and the character at index 5 is 'u', which are also equal. Therefore, the condition is true and the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
