<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, D and L. It then calculates the number of times the value of L can be divided into D using integer division and assigns it to the variable jump_time_L. 
Next, it calculates the remaining distance after all the complete jumps and adds it to jump_time_L to get the total number of jumps, which is assigned to the variable jump_time.
Finally, it prints the value of jump_time as the output.
In this case, D is 10 and L is 5. So, jump_time_L will be 2 (10 divided by 5) and the remaining distance will be 0. Therefore, jump_time will be 2.
