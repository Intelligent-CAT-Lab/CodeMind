The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 2 and 6 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 1+K = 1+4 = 5.
It checks if A is less than B. In this case, it is true. So it enters the if block.
Inside the if block, it initializes variable sum1 with 1. Then it checks if A is greater than sum1. In this case, it is true. So it enters the if block.
Inside the if block, it subtracts (A-sum1) from K and assigns the result back to K. So K becomes 4-1 = 3. Then it assigns A to sum1. So sum1 becomes 2.
Then it calculates (B-A)*(K/2) and adds the result to sum1. (B-A) = 6-2 = 4. K/2 = 3/2 = 1. So (B-A)*(K/2) = 4*1 = 4. So sum1 becomes 2+4 = 6.
Then it checks if K%2 is equal to 1. In this case, it is false. So it does not enter the if block.
Then it compares sum and sum1 and assigns the maximum value to sum. In this case, sum1 is greater than sum. So sum becomes 6.
After the if block, it prints the value of sum as output, which is 6.
