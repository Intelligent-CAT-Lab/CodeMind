<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input and calculates the remainder of their division. The first integer is read as a BigInteger using the `bigints()` method from the `LightScanner` class. The remainder is then converted to a string using the `toString()` method and printed as the output.
In this case, the first integer is 5 and the second integer is 8. The remainder of 5 divided by 8 is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
