<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input value `n` and passes it to the function `f()`. 
The function `f()` is a recursive function that calculates the value based on the following formula:
f(n) = (f(n-1) * 2) + 2

If the input value `n` is 0, the function returns 2.

In this case, the input value is 2. So, the function `f()` is called with the value 2.
f(2) = (f(1) * 2) + 2
f(1) = (f(0) * 2) + 2
f(0) = 2

Substituting the values:
f(0) = 2
f(1) = (2 * 2) + 2 = 6
f(2) = (6 * 2) + 2 = 14

So, the output of the code execution would be 14.
