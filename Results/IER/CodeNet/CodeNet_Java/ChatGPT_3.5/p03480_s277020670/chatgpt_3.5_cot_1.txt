<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then iterates over the character array to find the maximum length of consecutive 0s and 1s. It keeps track of the maximum length for both 0s and 1s separately. The maximum length is calculated by finding the minimum distance between two consecutive 0s or 1s and the maximum distance between a 0 and the end of the string or a 1 and the end of the string. Finally, it prints the maximum length of consecutive 0s and 1s as the output.
In this case, the input string is "010". The code will find the maximum length of consecutive 0s and 1s in the string. The maximum length of consecutive 0s is 1 and the maximum length of consecutive 1s is 1. Therefore, the output will be 1.
