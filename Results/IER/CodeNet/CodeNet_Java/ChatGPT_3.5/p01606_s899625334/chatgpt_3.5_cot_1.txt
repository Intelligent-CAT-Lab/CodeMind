The variable N and variable W are initialized with 10 and 2 respectively according to the input. An array a is initialized with size N*2+1.
The value of a[1] is incremented by W/2. Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from W/2+1 to W-1. Inside the loop, it increments a[1] by 1 and it enters another for loop.
The second for loop iterates from i to N with a step size of i. Inside the second for loop, it checks if j is greater than i*2. If it is, it increments a[j-W+1] by 1. Then it decrements a[j+1] by 1.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop. This for loop iterates from W to N. Inside the loop, it increments a[i-W+1] by 1 and it decrements a[i+1] by 1.
After the third for loop finishes, it enters another for loop. This for loop iterates from 1 to N-W+1. Inside the loop, it adds the current element a[i] with the previous element a[i-1].
Then it appends the current element a[i] to a StringBuilder object sb. Finally, it prints the StringBuilder object sb as output.
