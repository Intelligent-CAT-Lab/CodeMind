<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input. It then checks if C is between A and B or between B and A. If either of these conditions is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, A=3, B=8, and C=5. Since 3 < 5 < 8, the condition (A < C && C < B) is true. Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
