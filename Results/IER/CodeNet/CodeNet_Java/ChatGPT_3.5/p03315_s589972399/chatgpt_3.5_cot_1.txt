<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then initializes a variable x with 0. It then iterates through each character in the array and checks if it is a '+' or a '-'. If it is a '+', it increments the value of x by 1. If it is a '-', it decrements the value of x by 1. After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of x as the output.

In this case, the input string is "+-++". The loop iterates through each character in the string. The first character is '+', so x is incremented by 1. The second character is '-', so x is decremented by 1. The third character is '+', so x is incremented by 1. The fourth character is '+', so x is incremented by 1. After the loop finishes, the final value of x is 2.
