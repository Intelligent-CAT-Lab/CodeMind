<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "0ig3he12fz99". The code initializes two arrays, alpha_count and number_count, with size 26 and 10 respectively. These arrays will be used to count the occurrences of alphabets and numbers in the input string.

The code then iterates through each character in the input string. If the character is an alphabet, it increments the corresponding count in the alpha_count array. If the character is a number, it increments the corresponding count in the number_count array.

After counting the occurrences, the code calculates the length of the input string. It then calls the compress method twice, passing the alpha_count and number_count arrays as arguments. The compress method compresses consecutive occurrences of 3 or more characters into a single character. It returns the number of characters that were compressed.

Finally, the code subtracts the compressed characters from the length of the input string and prints the result.
