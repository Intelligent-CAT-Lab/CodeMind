<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function gcd() to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers. Then it defines a function solve() which takes input values a and b. It calculates the absolute difference between the next two input values and a, and stores it in variable a. It also calculates the absolute difference between the next two input values and b, and stores it in variable b. Then it calculates the greatest common divisor of a and b using the gcd() function. It calculates the answer by dividing a by g and adding b by g, and then subtracting 1. Finally, it prints the answer multiplied by g.
In the main function, it calls the solve() function and flushes the output.
The input values are 1, 1, 3, and 4.
