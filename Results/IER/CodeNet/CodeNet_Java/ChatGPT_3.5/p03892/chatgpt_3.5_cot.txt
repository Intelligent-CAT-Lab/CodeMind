<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a method `solve()` which takes no arguments and returns void. Inside the `solve()` method, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input. It then calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `c` and stores it in the variable `x`. Similarly, it calculates the absolute difference between `b` and `d` and stores it in the variable `y`. Finally, it calculates the maximum of `x` and `y` and prints it as the output.

In this case, the input is `1 1 3 4`. So, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `c` is 3, and `d` is 4. The absolute difference between `a` and `c` is 2, and the absolute difference between `b` and `d` is 3. The maximum of 2 and 3 is 3.
