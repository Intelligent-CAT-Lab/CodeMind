<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 3 and variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 6 (2 * k) to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calls the calc() method passing i, n and k as parameters.
Inside the calc() method, it initializes a new Modulo object ret with value 0.
Then it initializes an integer variable p with 0.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to i - j - 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i - j is less than or equal to k. If it is, it increments the value of p by 1.
After the for loop, it initializes an integer variable l with k - 2 * p - (i % 2 == 0 ? 1 : 0).
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the minimum of n and p.
Inside the for loop, it checks if l is equal to 0 and q is equal to 0. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
Inside the for loop, it initializes a new Modulo object tmp with value 1.
Then it calls the mlt() method of tmp passing Modulo.c(p, q) as parameter.
Then it calls the mlt() method of tmp passing Modulo.pow(2, q) as parameter.
Then it calls the mlt() method of tmp passing Modulo.h(n - q, q + l) as parameter.
Then it calls the add() method of ret passing tmp as parameter.
After the for loop, it returns the value of ret.
Back in the main method, it calls the add() method of ans passing the value returned by calc() method as parameter.
Then it checks if i is divisible by 2. If it is, it calls the add() method of ans passing the value returned by calc() method with n - 1 as parameter.
Then it prints the value of ans.
This process is repeated for each value of i in the range 2 to 6.
