<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers k and n as input. It then initializes the Modulo class with the value of mod as 998244353 and builds the combination using the buildCombination method.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to 2*k. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of ans by calling the calc method with the current value of i, n, and k as parameters. If i is even, it also calculates the value of ans by calling the calc method with i, n-1, and k as parameters.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
The calc method calculates the value of ret by calling the add method of the Modulo class with the calculated values of p, l, q, and tmp as parameters. It then returns the value of ret.
The calc method calculates the value of p by iterating from 1 to i-j and checking if i-j is less than or equal to k. It then calculates the value of l by subtracting 2*p from k and subtracting 1 if i is even. It then iterates from 0 to the minimum of n and p and calculates the value of tmp by calling the mlt method of the Modulo class with the calculated values of p, q, and l as parameters. It then adds the value of tmp to ret.
The getValue method of the Modulo class returns the value of the Modulo object.
