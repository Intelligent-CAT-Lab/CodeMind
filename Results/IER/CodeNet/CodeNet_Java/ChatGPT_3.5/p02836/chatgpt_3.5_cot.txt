<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and calculates its length. It initializes a variable count with 0.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to length/2. In each iteration, it compares the character at index i with the character at index (length - 1 - i). If they are not equal, it increments the count variable.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of count as the output.
