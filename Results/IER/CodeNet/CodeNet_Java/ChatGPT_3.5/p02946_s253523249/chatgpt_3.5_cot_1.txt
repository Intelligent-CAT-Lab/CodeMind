<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 3 and variable x is initialized with 7 according to the input. 
Then it calculates the minimum value as x - k + 1 and the maximum value as x + k - 1.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from the minimum value to the maximum value.
Inside the loop, it prints the current value of i followed by a space, except for the last value where it doesn't print the space.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
