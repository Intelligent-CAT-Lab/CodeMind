<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable x. 
Then it checks if the value of x is greater than or equal to 30. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the value of x is 25, which is less than 30. Therefore, the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
