<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a Rubik's Cube and performs various operations on it based on the input. The `R` operation rotates the right face of the cube clockwise. It swaps the values of certain indices in the `is` array, which represents the colors of the cube's faces.

The `R` operation swaps the values at indices 12, 13, 14, and 15 in the `is` array.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of `R` would be the updated `is` array after performing the rotation.
