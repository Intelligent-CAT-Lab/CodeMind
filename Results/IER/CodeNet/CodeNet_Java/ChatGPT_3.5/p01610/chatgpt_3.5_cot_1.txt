<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single character input and stores it in the variable `line`. Then it calls the `solve()` method.
Inside the `solve()` method, an array `is` of size 24 is initialized. Each element of the array is set to the index divided by 4.
Then, a switch statement is used to perform different operations based on the input character.
In this case, the input character is 'R', so the `right()` method is called.
The `right()` method swaps the values of certain elements in the `is` array based on the indices passed to the `swap()` method.
After the switch statement, a 2D array `tab` is defined, which represents the final state of the cube.
The elements of `tab` are determined by the values in the `is` array.
Finally, the elements of `tab` are printed, with each element represented by a character.
