<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable d1 and variable d2 are initialized with 2, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable d1s and variable d2s are initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the last two bits of variable d1 and variable d2 are both 0. If they are, it increments variable d1s and variable d2s by 1 and right shifts variable d1 and variable d2 by 2 bits respectively.
After the while loop, it initializes variable need with the square of variable n.
Then it enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2n-1 for both variables i and j.
Inside the nested for loop, it checks if the last two bits of variable d1 and variable d2 are 1 and if the bitwise XOR of the right shifted i and j by d1s is odd. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Then it checks if the last two bits of variable d1 is 2 and if the right shifted i by d1s is odd. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Then it checks if the last two bits of variable d2 and variable d2 are 1 and if the bitwise XOR of the right shifted i and j by d2s is odd. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Then it checks if the last two bits of variable d2 is 2 and if the right shifted i by d2s is odd. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints the values of variable i and variable j.
Then it decrements variable need by 1.
If variable need becomes 0, it returns from the function.
If the nested for loop finishes without returning from the function, it throws an AssertionError.
