<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, d1, and d2. It then initializes two variables d1s and d2s to 0. 
The code then enters two while loops to calculate the number of trailing zeros in d1 and d2 by repeatedly right-shifting the numbers by 2 and incrementing the respective counters.
Next, it initializes a variable need to n*n.
Then, it enters a nested for loop with i and j iterating from 0 to 2*n-1.
Inside the loop, it checks four conditions using bitwise operations and if any of the conditions are not met, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If all the conditions are met, it prints the values of i and j.
After printing, it decrements the value of need by 1.
If the value of need becomes 0, it returns from the function.
If the loop finishes without returning, it throws an AssertionError.
