<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a long integer from the input and assigns it to the variable x. Then it calculates the answer using the formula:
ans = x / 11 * 2 + x % 11 / 7 + Math.min(x % 11, 1)
The value of ans is then printed as the output.
In this case, the input is 7. So, x = 7.
Using the formula, ans = 7 / 11 * 2 + 7 % 11 / 7 + Math.min(7 % 11, 1)
Since 7 / 11 = 0 and 7 % 11 = 7, the formula simplifies to:
ans = 0 * 2 + 7 / 7 + Math.min(7, 1)
ans = 0 + 1 + 1
ans = 2
So, the return value of `7` would be 2.
