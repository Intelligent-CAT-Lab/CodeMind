<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an input integer x using the Scanner class. It then calculates the value of ans using the formula: x / 11 * 2 + x % 11 / 7 + Math.min(x % 11, 1). Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.

In this case, the input value of x is 7. So, the value of ans can be calculated as follows:
ans = 7 / 11 * 2 + 7 % 11 / 7 + Math.min(7 % 11, 1)
    = 0 * 2 + 7 / 7 + Math.min(7 % 11, 1)
    = 0 + 1 + Math.min(7 % 11, 1)
    = 0 + 1 + Math.min(7, 1)
    = 0 + 1 + 1
    = 2

Therefore, the output would be 2.
