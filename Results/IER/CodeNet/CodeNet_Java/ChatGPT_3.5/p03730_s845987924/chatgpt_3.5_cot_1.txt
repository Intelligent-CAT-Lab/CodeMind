<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to B. Inside the loop, it checks if the expression A*i%B is equal to C. If it is, it prints "YES" and returns from the main method. If the loop finishes without finding a match, it prints "NO".

In this case, A=7, B=5, and C=1. The loop iterates from 1 to 5. For each iteration, it checks if 7*i%5 is equal to 1. The first value of i that satisfies this condition is i=3, because 7*3%5 is equal to 1. Therefore, the code will print "YES" and return.

<<<Output>>>
YES
