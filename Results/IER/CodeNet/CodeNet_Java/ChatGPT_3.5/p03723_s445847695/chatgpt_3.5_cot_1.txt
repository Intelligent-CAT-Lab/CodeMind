<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It checks if all three numbers are equal and even. If they are, it prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 1,000,000,000.

Inside the for loop, it checks if any of the three numbers (a, b, c) are odd. If any of them are odd, it prints the current value of i and returns.

If none of the numbers are odd, it calculates new values for a, b, and c by dividing each number by 2 and adding the halves of the other two numbers. This process continues until one of the numbers becomes odd or the for loop reaches its maximum iteration count.

If the for loop completes without finding an odd number, it means that the numbers a, b, and c are all even and the loop has reached its maximum iteration count. In this case, it does not print anything.
