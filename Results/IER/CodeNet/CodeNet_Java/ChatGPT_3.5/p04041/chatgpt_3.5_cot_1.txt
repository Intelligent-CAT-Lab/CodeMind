<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: n, x, y, and z. It then initializes a variable sum as the sum of x, y, z, and 1. It also initializes a variable mask as 2^sum - 1. It then initializes a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (mask+1) and sets all its elements to 0. It also initializes a variable ng as 0 and sets certain bits in ng based on the values of x, y, and z. It then sets dp[0][1] to 1.

The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n-1, and the inner loop iterates from 0 to mask. Inside the inner loop, there is another loop that iterates from 1 to 10. Inside this loop, the code calculates a new value res by shifting the bits of state by j and adding 1. If the bitwise AND of res and ng is equal to ng, the code continues to the next iteration of the inner loop. Otherwise, it adds dp[i][state] to dp[i+1][res] and takes the modulo with MOD.

After the nested loops, the code calculates a variable ans as 10^n. Then, it subtracts each element of dp[n][i] from ans and takes the modulo with MOD. Finally, it prints (ans+MOD)%MOD as the output.
