<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 100 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It calculates the number of coins needed to make change for n cents using quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
First, it calculates the number of quarters needed by dividing n by 25 and adds it to ans. Then it updates the value of n by taking the remainder of n divided by 25.
Next, it calculates the number of dimes needed by dividing n by 10 and adds it to ans. Then it updates the value of n by taking the remainder of n divided by 10.
Then, it calculates the number of nickels needed by dividing n by 5 and adds it to ans. Then it updates the value of n by taking the remainder of n divided by 5.
Finally, it adds the remaining value of n to ans, which represents the number of pennies needed.
After all the calculations, it prints the final value of ans as output, which represents the total number of coins needed to make change for n cents.
