<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and initializes `ans` to 0. 
Then it calculates the number of 25 cent coins that can be obtained from `n` by dividing `n` by 25 and adds it to `ans`. 
Next, it updates `n` to the remainder after dividing by 25. 
It repeats the same process for 10 cent coins, 5 cent coins, and 1 cent coins, updating `ans` and `n` accordingly. 
Finally, it prints the value of `ans` as the output.
In this case, since `n` is 100, the number of 25 cent coins is 4, the number of 10 cent coins is 0, the number of 5 cent coins is 0, and the number of 1 cent coins is 0. Therefore, the output would be 4.
