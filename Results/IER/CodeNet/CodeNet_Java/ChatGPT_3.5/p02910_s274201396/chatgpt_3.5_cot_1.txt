<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and splits it into an array of characters. It then iterates through the array and checks if the character at even index (starting from 0) is either "R", "U", or "D". If it is not, it increments the count variable and breaks out of the loop. If the character at odd index is not "L", "U", or "D", it also increments the count variable and breaks out of the loop.

After the loop, it checks if the count variable is 0. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the input string is "RUDLUDR". The code will iterate through the array and check the characters at even and odd indices. Since all the characters in the input string are either "R", "U", "D", "L", the count variable will remain 0. Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
