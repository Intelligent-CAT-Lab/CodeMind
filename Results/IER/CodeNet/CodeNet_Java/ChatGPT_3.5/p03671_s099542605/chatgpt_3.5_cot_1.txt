<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input using a Scanner object. It initializes two ArrayLists, `num` and `param`, to store integers and strings respectively. It also initializes a variable `system` to 0.

The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as there is more input. Inside the loop, it checks if the next token is an integer using `sc.hasNextInt()`. If it is, it adds the integer to the `num` ArrayList. If it is not an integer, it checks the value of `system`. If `system` is 0, it adds the next token to the `param` ArrayList. If `system` is 1, it adds the next line to the `param` ArrayList.

After reading all the input, the code calls the `Method` method and passes the `num` and `param` ArrayLists as arguments. In the `Method` method, it sorts the `num` ArrayList in ascending order using `Collections.sort()`. Then it prints the sum of the first two elements of the `num` ArrayList.
