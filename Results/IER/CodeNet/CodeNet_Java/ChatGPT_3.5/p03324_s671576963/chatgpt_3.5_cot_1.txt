<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b respectively.
Then it checks if b is equal to 100. If it is, it assigns b the value of 101.
Next, it checks the value of a. If a is equal to 0, it prints the value of b.
If a is equal to 1, it prints the value of 100 multiplied by b.
If a is neither 0 nor 1, it prints the value of 10000 multiplied by b.
In this case, a is 0 and b is 5. So, it will print the value of b, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
