<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and checks if there is any occurrence of the substring "AC" in the string. If there is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input string is "BACD". The code iterates through each character of the string and checks if the current character and the next character form the substring "AC". If it finds such occurrence, it prints "Yes" and returns. Otherwise, it continues to the next character. In this case, the code will find the occurrence of "AC" at index 1 and print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
