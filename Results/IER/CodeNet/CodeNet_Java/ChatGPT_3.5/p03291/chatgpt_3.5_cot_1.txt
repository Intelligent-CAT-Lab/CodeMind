<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and stores it in a character array called 's'. It then initializes four arrays: 'ac', 'bc', 'cc', and 'xc', each of size n+1, where n is the length of the input string. These arrays are used to store the cumulative counts of 'A', 'B', 'C', and '?' characters respectively.

Next, the code iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is 'A', 'B', 'C', or '?', the corresponding count in the respective array is incremented. This is done to keep track of the cumulative counts of each character up to the current position.

After that, the code initializes a variable 'ans' to 0. It then iterates over each character in the input string again. If the character is 'B' or '?', the code calculates four values: 'a', 'l', 'c', and 'r'. 'a' represents the count of 'A' characters before the current position, 'l' represents the count of '?' characters before the current position, 'c' represents the count of 'C' characters after the current position, and 'r' represents the count of '?' characters after the current position.

Using these values, the code calculates four terms and adds them to 'ans'. Each term is calculated by multiplying a power of 3 with the corresponding counts and 'a', 'l', 'c', and 'r'. The power of 3 is calculated using the 'power' method, which performs modular exponentiation.

Finally, the code prints 'ans' modulo MOD.
