The variable n is initialized with the value 8 according to the input. And variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it continues to execute as long as the value of n is greater than 1.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the remainder of n divided by 3 is equal to 0. If it is, it adds 0 to n, otherwise it adds (3 - n % 3) to n. Then it divides n by 3 and assigns the result back to n.
After each iteration of the while loop, it increments the value of count by 1.
The while loop continues until the value of n becomes 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of count as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
