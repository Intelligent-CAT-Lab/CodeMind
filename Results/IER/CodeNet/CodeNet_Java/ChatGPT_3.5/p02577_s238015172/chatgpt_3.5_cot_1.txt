<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `n` and converts it into a character array `work`. It then iterates over each character in `work` and converts it into an integer using `Character.getNumericValue()` and adds it to the variable `num`. After that, it checks if `num` is divisible by 9. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the input string is "123456789". The character array `work` will contain the characters '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. The variable `num` will be the sum of these digits, which is 45. Since 45 is divisible by 9, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
