<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a double input from the user and assigns it to variable d. Then it calculates the value of variable e by adding 1 to the integer part of d. 
Next, it calculates the maximum value between e and d divided by the square root of 2 multiplied by 2. 
Finally, it prints the value of e as the output.
In this case, the input is 1.000. The integer part of 1.000 is 1, so e is assigned the value of 2. 
The maximum value between 2 and 1.000 divided by the square root of 2 multiplied by 2 is 2.828. 
Therefore, the output would be 2.828.
