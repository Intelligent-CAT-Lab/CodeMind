The variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
A 3D array dp is initialized with dimensions [2][n+1][n+1]. The initial value of dp[0][1][1] is set to 1.
Then it enters a for loop which iterates from 0 to m-1. In each iteration, it calculates the values of dp[to][j+1][k], dp[to][j][k] and dp[to][j][j] based on the values of dp[fr][j][k] in the previous iteration.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of dp[m%2][n][n] as output.
