The variable n and variable a are initialized with 8 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with the value of n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 40 to check each integer m in this range. The value of variable m is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable c as the integer part of the mth root of n.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from c-2 to c+2 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the condition Math.log(i) * (m - 1) > 40 * Math.log(2) is true. If it is true, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If the condition is false, it enters a third for loop and it iterates from 0 to m-1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the third for loop, it calculates the value of variable res as a * (m - 1) + j * i + (m - 1 - j) * (i + 1).
Then it calculates the value of variable den as pow(i, j) * pow(i + 1, m - 1 - j).
Then it calculates the value of variable res as res + (n + den - 1) / den.
Then it updates the value of variable ans as the minimum value between ans and res.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output.
