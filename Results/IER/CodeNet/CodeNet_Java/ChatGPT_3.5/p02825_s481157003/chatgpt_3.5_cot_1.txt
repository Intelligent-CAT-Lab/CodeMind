<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a nested class `TaskC` inside it. The `TaskC` class has a `solve` method that takes an `InputReader` and an `OutputWriter` as parameters. 

Inside the `solve` method, there are several conditional statements based on the value of `n`. If `n` is equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is equal to 3, it calls the `calc` method with the parameter 1 and then prints the resulting array `a`. If `n` is equal to 4, it prints a specific pattern of characters. Otherwise, it sets `N` to the value of `n` and then enters a while loop that subtracts 4 from `n` until `n` is less than or equal to 8. Inside the while loop, it calls the `calc` method with the parameter 3 and stores the result in a boolean variable `r`. If `r` is false, it throws a `RuntimeException`. Finally, it prints the resulting array `a` based on the values of `n` and `N`.

The `calc` method takes an integer `need` as a parameter and returns a boolean value. It initializes a 2D array `a` with dimensions `n` x `n`, and two arrays `ch` and `cv` with length `n`. It also initializes a variable `this.need` with the value of `need`. Then it calls the `brute` method with the parameters 0 and 0. 

The `brute` method takes two integers `x` and `y` as parameters and returns a boolean value. If `x` is greater than or equal to `n`, it checks if all elements in the `ch` and `cv` arrays are equal to `need` and returns true if they are, otherwise it returns false. If `ch[x]` is greater than `need` or `cv[y]` is greater than `need`, it returns false. Otherwise, it calculates the next values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y`. If `ny` is greater than or equal to `n`, it checks if `ch[x]` is equal to `need`. If it is not, it returns false. Then it sets `ny` to 0 and `nx` to `x + 1`. If the recursive call to `brute` with the new values of `nx` and `ny` returns true, it returns true. 

If the above conditions are not met, it calculates the value of `id` based on the current values of `x` and `y`. If `a[x][y]` is equal to 0 and `y` is less than `n - 1` and `a[x][y + 1]` is equal to 0, it sets `a[x][y]` and `a[x][y + 1]` to `id`, increments `ch[x]`, `cv[y]`, and `cv[y + 1]`, and if `ch[x]`, `cv[y]`, and `cv[y + 1]` are all less than or equal to `need`, it makes a recursive call to `brute` with the new values of `nx` and `ny`. If the recursive call returns true, it returns true. Finally, it resets the values of `a[x][y]`, `a[x][y + 1]`, `ch[x]`, `cv[y]`, and `cv[y + 1]` to their original values and returns false.
