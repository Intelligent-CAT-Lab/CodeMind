<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and x. It then calculates the height by dividing x by the square of a. It checks if the height is less than or equal to half of b. If it is, it calculates the answer using the formula a * b * b / (2 * x). If the height is greater than half of b, it calculates the answer using the formula (2 * a * a * b - 2 * x) / (a * a * a). Finally, it converts the answer to degrees using the Math.toDegrees() method and prints it.
In this case, a = 2, b = 2, and x = 4. The height is calculated as 4 / (2 * 2) = 1. The height is less than half of b, so the answer is calculated as 2 * 2 * 2 / (2 * 4) = 1. The answer is then converted to degrees, which is 45.0.
<<<Output>>>
45.0
