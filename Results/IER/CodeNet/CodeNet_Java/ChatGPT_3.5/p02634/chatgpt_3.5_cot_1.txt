The variable A, B, C, and D are initialized with 1, 1, 2, and 2 respectively according to the input. The variable MOD is initialized with 998244353L. The 2D array cell is initialized with size [C][D] and all elements are set to 0. Then, the element at index [A-1][B-1] in the cell array is set to 1. 

Next, a nested for loop is used to calculate the values of the remaining elements in the cell array. The loop iterates from A to C and from B to D. For each element at index [i][j], the following calculations are performed:
1. The element is updated by multiplying the element at [i-1][j] with j and taking the modulo MOD.
2. The element is updated by adding the product of the element at [i][j-1] and i, and taking the modulo MOD.
3. A temporary variable val is calculated by multiplying the element at [i-1][j-1] with i and taking the modulo MOD. Then, val is multiplied by j and taken the modulo MOD.
4. The element is updated by subtracting val, adding MOD, and taking the modulo MOD.
5. The element is updated by adding the element at [i-1][j] and taking the modulo MOD.
6. The element is updated by adding the element at [i][j-1] and taking the modulo MOD.

Finally, the value at the last element of the cell array, cell[C-1][D-1], is printed as the output.
