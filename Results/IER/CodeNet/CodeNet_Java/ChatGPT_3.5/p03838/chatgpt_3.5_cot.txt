<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers x and y from the input. It then goes through a series of if-else statements to determine the return value based on the values of x and y.

If x is greater than or equal to 0:
- If y is greater than or equal to 0:
  - If x is greater than y, it checks if y is 0. If it is, it returns x-y+1. Otherwise, it returns x-y+2.
  - If x is less than or equal to y, it returns y-x.
- If y is less than 0, it returns the absolute value of the difference between y and x plus 1.

If x is less than 0:
- If y is greater than or equal to 0:
  - If y is 0, it returns the absolute value of the difference between x and y.
  - If y is not 0, it returns the absolute value of the difference between x and y plus 1.
- If y is less than 0:
  - If x is greater than y, it returns x-y+2.
  - If x is less than or equal to y, it returns y-x.
