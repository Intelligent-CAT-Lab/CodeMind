<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A is initialized with 4 and variable B is initialized with 6 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from B+1 to infinity. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ca and variable remb.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ca by dividing i by A and adding the remainder of i divided by A to it.
Then it calculates the value of variable remb by taking the remainder of i divided by B.
Then it calculates the value of variable cb by dividing i by B, adding the remainder of i divided by A to it and adding the remainder of remb divided by A to it.
Then it checks if the value of ca is less than the value of cb. If it is, it prints the current value of i as output and returns from the function.
If the condition is not met, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If the loop finishes without meeting the condition, it prints -1 as output.
