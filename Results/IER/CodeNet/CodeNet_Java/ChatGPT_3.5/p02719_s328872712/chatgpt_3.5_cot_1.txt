<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input, n and k.
It then checks for various conditions to determine the output.
If n is equal to 0, it prints 0 and exits.
If n is greater than or equal to k, it checks if n modulo k is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 and exits.
If n modulo k is not equal to 0, it checks if the absolute difference between n modulo k and k is less than n modulo k. If it is, it prints n modulo k and exits.
If the absolute difference between n modulo k and k is not less than n modulo k, it prints the absolute difference between n modulo k and k and exits.
If n is less than k, it checks if k divided by 2 is less than or equal to n. If it is, it prints the absolute difference between n and k and exits.
If k divided by 2 is not less than or equal to n, it prints n and exits.
