<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input using the Scanner class. The first integer is assigned to variable a and the second integer is assigned to variable b. Then, a double variable c is declared. The value of c is calculated by multiplying a, b, and 1.0, and then dividing the result by the sum of a and b. Finally, the value of c is printed as output.
In this case, the input is "2 3". So, a will be assigned the value 2 and b will be assigned the value 3. The value of c will be calculated as (2 * 3 * 1.0) / (2 + 3) = 6.0 / 5 = 1.2.
<<<Output>>>
1.2
