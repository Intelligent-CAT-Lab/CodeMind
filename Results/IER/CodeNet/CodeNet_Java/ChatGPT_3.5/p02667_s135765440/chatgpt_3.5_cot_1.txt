<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input and stores it as a string in the array `s`. Then it converts each character of the string to an integer by subtracting the ASCII value of '0' from it. 

The code initializes an array `ips` of size 2 to store the prefix sum of even and odd indices of `s` where the value is 1. 

The code initializes variables `ans` to 0, `used` and `star` as boolean arrays of size `n` to keep track of used indices and starred indices respectively. It also initializes `cnt` to 0 to keep track of the number of starred indices.

The code then iterates over each index `i` of `s` and checks if the value at `i` is 1. If it is, it marks `used[i]` and `star[i]` as true, increments `cnt` and adds `cnt` to `ans`. If `i+1` is within the bounds of `s` and the value at `i+1` is 1, it marks `used[i+1]` as true, increments `ans` by `cnt` and increments `i` by 1.

The code then initializes an `occur` array to store the prefix sum of used indices. 

The code then iterates over each index `i` of `s` in reverse order. If `used[i]` is true, it checks if `star[i]` is true. If it is, it decrements `cnt` and continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it adds `cnt` to `ans`. If the prefix sum of used indices up to `i-1` is even, it adds the value of `ips[i%2]` at index `i` to `ans`. Otherwise, it adds the value of `ips[1-i%2]` at index `i` to `ans`.

Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.
