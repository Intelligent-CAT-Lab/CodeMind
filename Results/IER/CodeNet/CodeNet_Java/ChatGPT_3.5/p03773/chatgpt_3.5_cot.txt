<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, A and B.
It calculates the sum of A and B and checks if it is greater than 23.
If the sum is greater than 23, it subtracts 24 from the sum and assigns the result to the variable ans.
If the sum is not greater than 23, it assigns the sum to the variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, A is 9 and B is 12.
The sum of A and B is 21, which is not greater than 23.
Therefore, the value of ans will be 21.
<<<Output>>>
21
