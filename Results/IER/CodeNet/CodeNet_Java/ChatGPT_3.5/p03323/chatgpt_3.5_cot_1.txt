<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the input. It then checks if both a and b are less than or equal to 8. If they are, it prints "Yay!". Otherwise, it prints ":(".
In this case, the values of a and b are 5 and 4 respectively, which are both less than or equal to 8. Therefore, the code will print "Yay!" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
