<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and initializes a variable n with 0. It then iterates through each character in the string and checks if the character is equal to '1'. If it is, it increments the value of n by 1. After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of n as the output. In this case, the input string is "111100" and there are 4 occurrences of the character '1', so the output would be 4.
<<<Output>>>
