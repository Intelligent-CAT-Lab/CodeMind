<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in variable s. It then initializes variables i, j, and k with 0. 
The code then enters a for loop that iterates through each character in the input string s. 
Inside the loop, it checks if the current character in s matches the character at index j in the string "AKIHABARA". 
If they don't match, it increments j by 1. 
If j becomes greater than or equal to the length of "AKIHABARA" or the characters don't match, it prints "NO" and returns from the main method. 
If the current character in s is not 'A', it checks if it matches the character at index k in the string "KIHBR". 
If they match, it increments k by 1. If they don't match, it prints "NO" and returns from the main method. 
After the loop finishes, it checks if k is equal to the length of "KIHBR". If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, the input string is "KIHBR" which matches the string "KIHBR" exactly. So, the output will be "YES".
