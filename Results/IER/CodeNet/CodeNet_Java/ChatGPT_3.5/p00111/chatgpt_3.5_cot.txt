<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two HashMaps, `hash` and `hash2`, which map characters to binary strings and vice versa. 
Then it enters a loop that reads input from the user until there is no more input. 
Inside the loop, it reads a line of input and stores it in the `buffer` variable. 
Then it initializes an empty string `b` and iterates over each character `c` in the `buffer`. 
For each character, it appends the corresponding binary string from `hash2` to `b`. 
After that, it initializes two empty strings `temp` and `ans`. 
Then it iterates over each character `c` in `b`. 
For each character, it appends it to `temp` and checks if `temp` is a key in `hash`. 
If it is, it appends the corresponding character from `hash` to `ans`, resets `temp` to an empty string, and continues to the next character. 
Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. 
In this case, the input is "?D-C'KOPUA". 
The corresponding binary strings for each character are "?": "11111", "D": "00011", "-": "11101", "C": "0101", "'": "11110", "K": "01010", "O": "01110", "P": "01111", "U": "10100", "A": "100101". 
After converting each character to its binary string representation, we get "11111000110111010101111100101110010100101110100010100". 
Then, we iterate over each character in the binary string and check if it is a key in `hash`. 
The first key we encounter is "11111", which corresponds to "?". 
So, we append "?" to `ans` and reset `temp` to an empty string. 
The next key we encounter is "00011", which corresponds to "D". 
So, we append "D" to `ans` and reset `temp` to an empty string. 
We continue this process until we reach the end of the binary string. 
The final value of `ans` is "?D". 
Therefore, the return value of `?D-C'KOPUA` is "?D".
