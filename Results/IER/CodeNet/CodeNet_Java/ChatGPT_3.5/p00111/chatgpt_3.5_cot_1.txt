The code defines two HashMaps, `hash` and `hash2`, which map characters to binary strings and vice versa. 
Then, it enters a loop that reads input from the user until there are no more lines to read. 
For each line of input, it iterates over each character and converts it to its corresponding binary string using `hash2`. 
It then concatenates these binary strings and checks if the concatenated string exists in `hash`. 
If it does, it retrieves the corresponding character and appends it to the `ans` string. 
Finally, it prints the `ans` string as the output.
In this case, the input is "?D-C'KOPUA`?".
The corresponding binary strings for each character are "?": "11111", "D": "00011", "-": "11101", "C": "0101", "'": "11110", "K": "01010", "O": "01110", "P": "01111", "U": "10100", "A": "100101", "`": "11010", "?": "000001".
The concatenated binary string is "1111100011011101110110101110010111001010001010010010110100000001".
The corresponding characters for each binary string are "11111": "?", "00011": "D", "11101": "-", "0101": "C", "11110": "'", "01010": "K", "01110": "O", "01111": "P", "10100": "U", "100101": "A", "11010": "`", "000001": "?".
The output is "?D-C'KOPUA`?".
