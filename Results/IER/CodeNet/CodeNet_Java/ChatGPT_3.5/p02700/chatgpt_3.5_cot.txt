<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input array of integers and assigns the values to variables a, b, c, and d respectively. Then it calculates the value of t as c divided by b and the value of tt as the remainder of c divided by b. It also calculates the value of y as a divided by d and the value of u as the remainder of a divided by d.

Then it enters a while loop that continues as long as a is greater than or equal to 0 or c is greater than or equal to 0. Inside the loop, it subtracts b from c and checks if c is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Yes" and returns. Otherwise, it subtracts d from a and checks if a is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints "No" and returns.

If the while loop condition is not met, the code does not print anything.

Therefore, the return value of `10 9 10 10` would be nothing.
