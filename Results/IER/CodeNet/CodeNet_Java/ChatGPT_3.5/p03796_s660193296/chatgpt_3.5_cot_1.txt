<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable pow is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of pow by multiplying the current integer i with the previous value of pow and then taking the modulo with MOD.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable pow as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
