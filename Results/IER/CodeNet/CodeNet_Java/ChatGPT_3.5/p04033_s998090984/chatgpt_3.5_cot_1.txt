<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b respectively. It then closes the scanner.
The code initializes an array of strings called ans with three elements: "Positive", "Negative", and "Zero".
The code initializes an integer variable called an with a value of 0.
The code multiplies variables a and b and assigns the result to a long variable called tmp.
The code then checks if tmp is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it sets an to 2.
If tmp is greater than 0, the code checks if a is less than 0. If it is, it calculates tmp as b - a + 1.
If tmp is not divisible by 2, it sets an to 1.
Finally, the code prints the element at index an in the ans array.
In this case, since a = 1 and b = 3, tmp = 1 * 3 = 3, which is greater than 0.
Since a is not less than 0, the code does not enter the if statement.
Therefore, an remains 0, and the code prints "Positive".
