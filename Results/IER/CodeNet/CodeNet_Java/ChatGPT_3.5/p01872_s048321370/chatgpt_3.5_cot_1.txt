<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and converts it into a character array. It then iterates through the character array and checks if each character is a question mark or a digit. If it is a question mark, it assigns the corresponding index value in the num array as 11 minus the current index. If it is a digit, it converts the character to an integer and assigns it to the corresponding index value in the num array.

After assigning the values to the num array, the code enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 9. In each iteration, it calculates the sum of the product of each digit in the num array and a corresponding value based on the index. The value is calculated using the formula q = j + 1 if j is less than or equal to 6, and q = j - 5 otherwise. The sum is then checked if it is divisible by 11. If it is, the sum is set to 0, otherwise it is set to the remainder of the division by 11.

The code then checks if the remainder of (11 - sum) divided by 11 is equal to the first digit in the num array. If it is, it increments the cnt variable and assigns the current iteration value to the ans variable.

Finally, the code checks if cnt is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of ans. Otherwise, it prints "MULTIPLE".
