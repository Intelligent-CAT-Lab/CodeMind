The variable t is initialized with 725 according to the input.
Then it checks the value of t against a series of conditions in descending order.
If t is greater than or equal to 1800, it prints 1.
If t is greater than or equal to 1600, it prints 2.
If t is greater than or equal to 1400, it prints 3.
If t is greater than or equal to 1200, it prints 4.
If t is greater than or equal to 1000, it prints 5.
If t is greater than or equal to 800, it prints 6.
If t is greater than or equal to 600, it prints 7.
Otherwise, it prints 8.
In this case, t is 725, which is less than 800 and 600, so it falls into the last condition and the output will be 8.
<<<Output>>>
