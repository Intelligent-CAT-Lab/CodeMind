<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and initializes an array f of size 101 to store the factors of numbers from 2 to n. It then iterates from 2 to n and calculates the factors of each number using the factor() method. The factor() method divides the number by each prime number from 2 to 100 and counts the number of times each prime factor appears in the number. After calculating the factors for all numbers from 2 to n, it counts the number of numbers that have at least 2, 4, 14, 24, and 74 factors. Finally, it calculates the total number of combinations of numbers that can be formed using these factors and prints the result.
In this case, the input is 9. The factors of numbers from 2 to 9 are calculated as follows:
2: 1 factor
3: 1 factor
4: 2 factors (2^2)
5: 1 factor
6: 2 factors (2 * 3)
7: 1 factor
8: 3 factors (2^3)
9: 2 factors (3^2)
The counts of numbers with at least 2, 4, 14, 24, and 74 factors are as follows:
t_3 = 6
t_5 = 3
t_15 = 1
t_25 = 1
t_75 = 0
The total number of combinations of numbers is calculated as:
t_75 + t_25 * (t_3 - 1) + t_15 * (t_5 - 1) + t_5 * (t_5 - 1) / 2 * (t_3 - 2) = 0 + 1 * (6 - 1) + 1 * (3 - 1) + 1 * (3 - 1) / 2 * (6 - 2) = 0 + 5 + 2 + 2 / 2 * 4 = 0 + 5 + 2 + 1 * 4 = 0 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 11
Therefore, the output is 11.
