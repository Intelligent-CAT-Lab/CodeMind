<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: w, h, x, and y. It then calculates the area of a rectangle with width w and height h and stores it in the variable ans. It also initializes the variable a to 0.

Next, it checks if x+x is equal to w and y+y is equal to h. If both conditions are true, it sets the value of a to 1.

Finally, it prints the values of ans and a as output.

In this case, the input is 2 3 1 2. So, w=2, h=3, x=1, and y=2.

The area of the rectangle is calculated as (2*3)/2 = 3.

Since x+x is not equal to w and y+y is not equal to h, the value of a remains 0.

Therefore, the output will be "3.0 0".
