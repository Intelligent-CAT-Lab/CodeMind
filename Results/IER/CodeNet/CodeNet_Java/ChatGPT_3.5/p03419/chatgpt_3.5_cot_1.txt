<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input, n and m.
It checks if either n or m is equal to 2. If either of them is 2, it prints 0 and returns.
If neither n nor m is equal to 2, it calculates the answer by subtracting 2 from n and m, and then multiplying the results.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, both n and m are equal to 2, so the code will print 0 as the output.
<<<Output>>>
0
