<<<Analysis>>>
The input expression is "3-2*3". The code first reads the input expression and splits it into individual characters. Then it creates a list of Elm objects to represent the expression. Each character is converted into an Elm object based on its type (number or operator). In this case, the expression list will contain the following objects: Num(3), Subtract(), Num(2), Multiply(), Num(3).

Next, the code evaluates the expression by converting it into postfix notation using the PRI array. The postfix notation of the expression is: Num(3), Num(2), Num(3), Multiply(), Subtract(). 

Finally, the code evaluates the postfix expression by performing the operations in the correct order. The result of the expression is printed as the output.
