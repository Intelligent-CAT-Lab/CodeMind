<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input expression `3-2*3` and converts it into a list of Elm objects representing the expression. It then evaluates the expression using postfix notation and returns the result.

The expression `3-2*3` is parsed into the following list of Elm objects:
- Num(3)
- Subtract
- Num(2)
- Multiply
- Num(3)

The postfix notation of this expression is:
- Num(3)
- Num(2)
- Num(3)
- Multiply
- Subtract

The code then evaluates the postfix expression and returns the result.

<<<Output>>>
-3
