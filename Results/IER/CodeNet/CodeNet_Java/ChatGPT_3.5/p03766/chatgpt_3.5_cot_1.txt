The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable f is initialized as an array of size n+1 and filled with -1. The variable suffix is also initialized as an array of size n+1 and filled with -1. The variable mod is initialized as a new instance of the Modular class with a value of 1e9 + 7.

The solve method is called with the input values. Inside the solve method, the variable ans is initialized with the result of the f method called with an argument of 1. The f method is a recursive method that calculates the value of f(i) for each i from 1 to n. The f(i) value is stored in the f array to avoid recalculating it.

The f method checks if the value of f(i) is already calculated. If it is not, it calculates the value based on the following conditions:
- If i is greater than n, the value of f(i) is 0.
- If i + 3 is less than or equal to n, the value of f(i) is calculated as the sum of f(i+1), the suffix(i+3) value, n - (n-i-1), and (n-1) * (n-1). The suffix(i+3) value is calculated by calling the suffix method with an argument of i+3.
- If i + 3 is greater than n, the value of f(i) is calculated as the sum of f(i+1) and (n-1) * n.

The suffix method is similar to the f method, but it calculates the suffix(i) value instead. It checks if the value of suffix(i) is already calculated. If it is not, it calculates the value as the sum of f(i) and the suffix(i+1) value.

The final value of ans is printed as the output.
