<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a nested class `TaskC` inside it. The `TaskC` class has a method `solve` which takes three parameters: `testNumber`, `in` and `out`. The method reads an integer `n` from the input, initializes two arrays `f` and `suffix` with size `n+1`, and fills them with -1. It then calls the method `f(1)` and stores the return value in the variable `ans`. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` as the output.
The `f` method is a recursive method that takes an integer `i` as a parameter. If `i` is greater than `n`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it checks if the value of `f[i]` is -1. If it is, it recursively calls `f(i+1)` and updates the value of `f[i]` based on the result. If `i+3` is less than or equal to `n`, it calculates the values of `since` and `until` and updates `f[i]` accordingly. Otherwise, it updates `f[i]` based on the values of `n` and `n-1`. Finally, it returns the value of `f[i]`.
The `suffix` method is also a recursive method that takes an integer `i` as a parameter. If `i` is greater than `n`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it checks if the value of `suffix[i]` is -1. If it is, it recursively calls `suffix(i+1)` and updates the value of `suffix[i]` based on the result. Finally, it returns the value of `suffix[i]`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `2` would be 0.
