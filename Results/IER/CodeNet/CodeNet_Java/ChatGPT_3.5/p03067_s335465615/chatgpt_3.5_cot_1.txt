<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c respectively.
It then initializes a boolean variable ans as false.
The code checks if a is less than or equal to b. If it is, it checks if c is between a and b (inclusive). If this condition is true, it sets ans to true.
If a is not less than or equal to b, it checks if c is between b and a (inclusive). If this condition is true, it sets ans to true.
Finally, it prints "Yes" if ans is true, and "No" if ans is false.
In this case, a = 3, b = 8, and c = 5. Since a is less than b, the code checks if c is between a and b. Since 5 is between 3 and 8, ans is set to true.
Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
