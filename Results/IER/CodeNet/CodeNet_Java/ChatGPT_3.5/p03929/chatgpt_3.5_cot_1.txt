<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable d are initialized with 7 and 7 respectively according to the input. 
It checks if N is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints 0 and returns.
Otherwise, it subtracts 3 from N and calculates the number of times N can be divided by 11 and stores it in the variable loop.
It also calculates the remainder of N divided by 11 and stores it in the variable amari.
Then it creates a 2D array called map which stores the values for each combination of d and amari.
Finally, it prints the value of loop multiplied by 5 plus the value in map[d][amari] as the output.
In this case, N is 4 and d is 7. Since N is less than or equal to 2, the output is 0.
