<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers a, b, and c from the input. These integers are then added to a set, which eliminates any duplicates. Finally, the size of the set is printed as the output.
In this case, the input is 3, 1, and 4. These values are added to the set, resulting in a set with three elements: {3, 1, 4}. The size of this set is 3, so the output will be 3.
