<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, m and k are initialized with 2, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable mod is initialized with 1000000007.
It calculates the value of xa using the C() method and the enumFIF() method. Then it calculates the value of xb using a for loop. After that, it calculates the value of xc using xa, xb and C() method. Then it calculates the value of xsum using xc and the enumFIF() method.
Then it calculates the value of ya using the C() method and the enumFIF() method. Then it calculates the value of yb using a for loop. After that, it calculates the value of yc using ya, yb and C() method. Then it calculates the value of ysum using yc and the enumFIF() method.
Finally, it prints the sum of xsum and ysum modulo mod as output.
