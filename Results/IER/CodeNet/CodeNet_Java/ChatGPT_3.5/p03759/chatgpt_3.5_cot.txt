<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then checks if the difference between a and b is equal to the difference between b and c. If the condition is true, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

In this case, the input values are 2, 4, and 6. The difference between 2 and 4 is -2, and the difference between 4 and 6 is -2 as well. Since the two differences are equal, the condition is true and the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
