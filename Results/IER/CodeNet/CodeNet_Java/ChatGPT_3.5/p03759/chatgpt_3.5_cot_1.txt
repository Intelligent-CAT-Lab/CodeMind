<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c respectively.
Then it checks if the difference between a and b is equal to the difference between b and c.
In this case, a-b = -2 and b-c = -2, so the condition is true.
Therefore, it will print "YES" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
YES
