<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 integers as input: n, m, a, b, p, and q.
It then checks if a and b are both equal to 1. If they are, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to reach m by adding p and q, and prints the result.
If a and b are not equal to 1, it calculates the maximum number of terms that can be added to reach m using the formula pa^k + qb^k, where k is the number of terms.
The code uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of k that satisfies the condition pa^k + qb^k <= m.
It then generates all possible combinations of terms using a bitmasking technique and stores them in two separate lists: pending1 and pending2.
The code then sorts both lists in ascending order.
Finally, it iterates through both lists and calculates the absolute difference between m and the sum of a term from pending1 and a term from pending2. It keeps track of the minimum difference and prints the result.
