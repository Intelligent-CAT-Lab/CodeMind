<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user and splits it into an array of strings called "input". Then it initializes an integer array called "array" with a size of 3 and an integer variable called "answer" with a value of 0.

Next, it enters a for loop that iterates 3 times. In each iteration, it converts the string element of the "input" array to an integer and assigns it to the corresponding index of the "array" array.

After that, it sorts the "array" array in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method.

Then, it enters another for loop that iterates 3 times. In each iteration, it subtracts the value of the current element of the "array" array from the last element of the "array" array and assigns the result back to the current element of the "array" array.

Next, it checks several conditions using if-else statements. If the sum of the first two elements of the "array" array is 0, it does nothing. If the first and second elements are not equal and the second and third elements are not equal, it checks additional conditions based on the parity of the first and second elements. If the first element is even, it increments the "answer" variable by 1, decrements the first element by 1, and adds half of the first element plus 1 and half of the second element plus 1 to the "answer" variable. If the second element is even, it increments the "answer" variable by 1, decrements the second element by 1, and adds half of the first element plus 1 and half of the second element plus 1 to the "answer" variable.

If the first and second elements are equal, it adds the value of the first element to the "answer" variable. If the second and third elements are equal, it adds the remainder of the first element divided by 2 to the "answer" variable and adds half of the first element plus 1 to the "answer" variable.

Finally, it prints the value of the "answer" variable as the output.
