<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1 according to the input. And a new object of class P is created with coordinates (0.0, 0.0) and (100.0, 0.0) and passed to the function kock along with n.
Inside the function kock, it checks if n is 0. If it is, it returns. Otherwise, it calculates the coordinates of points s, t, and u based on the given formulas.
Then it recursively calls the function kock with n-1 and the points p1 and s, and prints the coordinates of point s.
Then it recursively calls the function kock with n-1 and the points s and u, and prints the coordinates of point u.
Then it recursively calls the function kock with n-1 and the points u and t, and prints the coordinates of point t.
Then it recursively calls the function kock with n-1 and the points t and p2.
After the recursive calls, it prints the coordinates of point (100.0, 0.0).
