<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer r from the input. It then calculates the value of 3 * r * r and stores it in a variable. Finally, it prints the value of the variable as the output.
In this case, the input is 4. So, the value of r will be 4. 
The code then calculates 3 * 4 * 4, which is 48. 
Therefore, the output will be 48.
