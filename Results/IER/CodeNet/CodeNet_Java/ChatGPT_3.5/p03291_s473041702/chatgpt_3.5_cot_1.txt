<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a variable N with the value 1_000_000_007L and creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It then reads a string input from the user using the next() method of the Scanner object.
A 2D array d is created with dimensions [str.length() + 1][4].
The first element of the first row of d is set to 1.
Then, a for loop iterates from 1 to the length of the input string.
Inside the loop, it checks the character at index i-1 of the input string.
If the character is '?', the variable n is set to 3, otherwise it is set to 1.
The variables a, b, and c are set to 1 if the character is 'A', 'B', or 'C' respectively, otherwise they are set to 0.
The elements of the current row of d are calculated based on the previous row and the values of n, a, b, and c.
Finally, the last element of the last row of d is printed as the output.
