<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then initializes an integer array `arr` with the digits of the input number. 

The code also initializes a 6-dimensional array `dp` with dimensions `length + 1`, `10`, `10`, `10`, `10`, `2`. This array is used to store the number of valid combinations of digits at each position.

The code initializes a 2-dimensional array `counts` with dimensions `length + 1`, `2`. This array is used to store the count of valid combinations of digits at each position.

The code then sets the initial value of `dp[0][0][0][0][0][1]` to 1, indicating that there is 1 valid combination of digits at position 0.

Next, the code iterates over each position from 1 to `length` and calculates the number of valid combinations of digits at each position based on the previous positions.

Inside the nested loops, the code updates the values of `dp` and `counts` based on the current digit and the previous digits.

Finally, the code prints the sum of `counts[length][0]` and `counts[length][1]`, which represents the total number of valid combinations of digits.
