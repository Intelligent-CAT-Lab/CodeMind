<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input, first_N and first_M.
It initializes a constant variable MOD with the value 1000000007.
Then it checks if first_N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints (first_M+1)%MOD and exits.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of first_limit based on the value of first_N and first_M.
If (first_M+1)%(first_N-1) is equal to 0, then first_limit is set to (first_M+1)/(first_N-1)-1.
Otherwise, first_limit is set to (first_M+1)/(first_N-1).
Next, it checks if first_limit is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints (first_M+1)%MOD and exits.
Otherwise, it performs some calculations using BigInteger to handle large numbers.
It creates a BigInteger object bigMOD with the value of MOD.
It creates a BigInteger object limit with the value of first_limit.
It creates a BigInteger object A with the value of (first_M+1).
It creates a BigInteger object B with the value of 2*(first_M+1)*limit.
It creates a BigInteger object C with the value of (first_N-1)*limit*(first_limit+1).
Finally, it prints the result of (A+B-C)%bigMOD.
