<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers h and w as input. It initializes a variable ans with the maximum value of a long integer.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates twice, with k taking values 0 and 1. Inside the loop, it checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, it swaps the values of h and w.
Then it enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to w-1. Inside this loop, it performs two calculations for each value of i.
First, if w is greater than or equal to 3, it calculates the values of w1, w2, w3, h1, h2, and h3 based on the current values of i, h, and w. It then calls the calc() method with these values and updates the value of ans if the calculated result is smaller than the current value of ans.
Second, it calculates the values of w1, w2, w3, h1, h2, and h3 based on the current values of i, h, and w. It then calls the calc() method with these values and updates the value of ans if the calculated result is smaller than the current value of ans.
After the loops finish, it prints the final value of ans as the output.
