The code takes two long integers n and x as input. It then calls the function f(n-x, x) and adds the result to n. The function f is a recursive function that takes two long integers a and b as input. 
Inside the function f, it checks if a is greater than b. If it is, it swaps the values of a and b. Then it checks if b is divisible by a. If it is, it returns 2*(b/a)*a - a. Otherwise, it returns 2*(b/a)*a + f(a, b % a).
In the main function, the result of f(n-x, x) is added to n and stored in the variable ans. Finally, the value of ans is printed as the output.
So, the output of the code execution for the given input would be 5 + f(5-2, 2).
To calculate f(3, 2), it checks if 2 is divisible by 3. Since it is not, it returns 2*(2/3)*3 + f(2, 2 % 3).
To calculate f(2, 2 % 3), it checks if 2 % 3 is divisible by 2. Since it is not, it returns 2*(2/2)*2 + f(2, 2 % 2).
To calculate f(2, 2 % 2), it checks if 2 % 2 is divisible by 2. Since it is not, it returns 2*(2/2)*2 + f(2, 2 % 2).
To calculate f(2, 2 % 2), it checks if 2 % 2 is divisible by 2. Since it is not, it returns 2*(2/2)*2 + f(2, 2 % 2).
This process continues until the condition a > b is met. At that point, it returns 2*(2/2)*2 - 2.
So, the final value of ans would be 5 + (2*(2/3)*3 + (2*(2/2)*2 + (2*(2/2)*2 - 2))).
Calculating this expression, the output would be 9.
