<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input using the Scanner class and assigns them to variables a, t, and r respectively. Then it calculates the value of r * t / a and prints it as the output.
In this case, the values of a, t, and r are 180, 120, and 90 respectively. So the output would be (90 * 120) / 180 = 60.
<<<Output>>>
60
