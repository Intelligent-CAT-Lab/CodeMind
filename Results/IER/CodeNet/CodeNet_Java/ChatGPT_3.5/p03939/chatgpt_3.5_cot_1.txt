The variable N, variable d1 and variable x are initialized with 1, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from N to 1. In each iteration, it calculates the value of ans by adding d1 and (N-0.5)*x to it.
Then it updates the value of d1 and x based on the formulas given in the code.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output.
