<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable 'w'. It then initializes an array 'list' of size 26 to store the frequency of each character in the string. 

Next, it iterates over each character in the string using a for loop. For each character, it subtracts 97 from its ASCII value to get the index in the 'list' array and increments the value at that index.

After counting the frequency of each character, it checks if any character has an odd frequency. If it finds any character with an odd frequency, it prints "No" and returns from the main method.

If all characters have an even frequency, it prints "Yes" and returns from the main method.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
