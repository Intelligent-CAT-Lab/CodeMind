<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: a, b, and k.
It checks if k is greater than or equal to a. If it is, it subtracts (k-a) from b and sets a to 0.
If k is less than a, it subtracts k from a.
Then it checks if b is less than 0. If it is, it sets b to 0.
Finally, it prints the values of a and b.
In this case, a=2, b=3, and k=3.
Since k is equal to a, b is updated to b-(k-a) = 3-(3-2) = 2 and a is set to 0.
Then, b is printed as 2 and a is printed as 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
2
