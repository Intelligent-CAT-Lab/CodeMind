<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S and initializes a variable ans with "Yes".
It then checks if the length of the string S is odd. If it is, it sets ans to "No".
If the length of the string S is even, it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to half the length of the string S, incrementing by 2 in each iteration.
Inside the loop, it checks if the substring of S from index i to i+2 is equal to "hi". If it is not, it sets ans to "No".
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of ans as the output.

In the case of input "hihi", the length of the string is 4, which is even. The for loop iterates once, checking if the substring "hi" is equal to "hi", which is true. Therefore, the value of ans remains "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
