<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input S and initializes a string variable ans with "Yes".
It checks if the length of the string S is odd. If it is, it updates the value of ans to "No".
If the length of the string S is even, it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to S.length()/2 with a step of 2.
Inside the loop, it checks if the substring of S from index i to i+2 is equal to "hi". If it is not, it updates the value of ans to "No".
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of ans as the output.

In this case, the input string is "hihi" which has a length of 4 and is even. The for loop iterates once and checks if the substring "hi" is equal to "hi", which is true. Therefore, the value of ans remains "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
