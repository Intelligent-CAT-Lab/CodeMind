The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
The code calls the function f(n+1) and passes the value 4 to it.
Inside the function f, it checks if the value of n is already present in the HashMap mb. If it is, it returns the memoized value.
If n is less than or equal to 2, it returns n.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of res by recursively calling the function f with three different values: n/2, (n-1)/2, and (n+1)/2. It adds the results of these three recursive calls and takes the modulo with MOD.
Then it stores the calculated value of res in the HashMap mb with the key n.
Finally, it returns the value of res.
In the main function, it prints the result of f(n+1), which is the output.
