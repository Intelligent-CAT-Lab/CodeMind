<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input `n` and calls the function `f(n+1)`. Inside the function `f`, it first checks if the value of `n` is already memoized in the `mb` HashMap. If it is, it returns the memoized value. If not, it proceeds to calculate the value of `f(n)`.

If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates the value of `f(n/2) + f((n-1)/2) + f((n+1)/2)`. This is a recursive call to the function `f` with different values of `n`. The result is then taken modulo `MOD` and stored in the `mb` HashMap for memoization.

In the main function, the input `n` is read from the user and passed to the function `f` as `n+1`. The result of the function `f` is then printed as the output.

In this case, the input `n` is 3. So the function `f` is called with `n+1 = 4`.

The function `f(4)` is calculated as follows:
- `f(4) = f(2) + f(3) + f(2)`
- `f(2) = 2` (base case)
- `f(3) = f(1) + f(2) + f(2)`
- `f(1) = 1` (base case)
- `f(2) = 2` (base case)
- `f(3) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5`
- `f(4) = 2 + 5 + 2 = 9`

So the return value of `3` would be `9`.
