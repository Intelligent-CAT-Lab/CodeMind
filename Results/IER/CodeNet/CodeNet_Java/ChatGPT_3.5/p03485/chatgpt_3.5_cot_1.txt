<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input using the Scanner class. The first integer is assigned to variable a and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
Then it calls the solve() method passing the values of a and b as arguments.
Inside the solve() method, it calculates the sum of a and b and adds 1 to it. Then it divides the result by 2 and returns the quotient as the output.
In this case, the sum of 1 and 3 is 4. Adding 1 to it gives 5. Dividing 5 by 2 gives 2 as the quotient.
<<<Output>>>
2
