<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1900 according to the input.
It then calculates the value of (1000 - n%1000) and checks if it is equal to 1000. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the value of (1000 - n%1000).
In this case, (1000 - n%1000) = (1000 - 900) = 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
