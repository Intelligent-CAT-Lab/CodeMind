<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1900 according to the input. Then it calculates the value of variable x by dividing n by 1000, which is 1. And it calculates the value of variable y by taking the remainder of n divided by 1000, which is 900.
Then it checks if y is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 as output. Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable ans by subtracting n from 1000 * (x + 1), which is 1000 * (1 + 1) - 1900 = 100.
Finally, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
