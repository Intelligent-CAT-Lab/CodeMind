<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four integers from the input: a, b, c, and d. It then performs several multiplication operations to calculate the values of ac, ad, bd, and bc. Finally, it prints the maximum value among ad, ac, bc, and bd.

Given the input "1 2 1 1", the values of ac, ad, bd, and bc would be:
ac = 1 * 1 = 1
ad = 1 * 1 = 1
bd = 2 * 1 = 2
bc = 2 * 1 = 2

The maximum value among ad, ac, bc, and bd is 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
