The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is initialized with 6 according to the input.
A TreeMap object map is created to store the prime factors of m and their frequencies.
A variable tm is initialized with the value of m.
A for loop is used to iterate from 2 to the square root of m.
Inside the loop, it checks if tm is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i to the map and divides tm by i.
After the loop, if tm is greater than 1, it means that tm is a prime number and it adds tm to the map.
A variable ans is initialized with 1.
A for-each loop is used to iterate through the values of the map, which represents the frequencies of the prime factors.
Inside the loop, it calculates the combination of n+c-1 choose n-1 and multiplies it with ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans modulo MOD as the output.
