<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input X. It then calculates the number of 500 yen bills (gohyaku) that can be obtained by dividing X by 500. It subtracts the value of 500*gohyaku from X. Then it calculates the number of 5 yen coins (goen) that can be obtained by dividing X by 5. Finally, it prints the sum of 1000*gohyaku and 5*goen as the output.
In this case, the input value is 1024. 
The number of 500 yen bills that can be obtained is 2 (1024/500 = 2). 
After subtracting 500*2 from X, the value of X becomes 24. 
The number of 5 yen coins that can be obtained is 4 (24/5 = 4). 
The output is the sum of 1000*2 and 5*4, which is 2000 + 20 = 2020.
