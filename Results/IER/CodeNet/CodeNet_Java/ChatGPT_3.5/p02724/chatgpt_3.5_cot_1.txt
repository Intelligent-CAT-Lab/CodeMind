The variable X is initialized with 1024 according to the input. 
Then it calculates the number of 500 yen coins that can be obtained by dividing X by 500 and assigns it to the variable gohyaku.
Then it subtracts the value of 500*gohyaku from X.
Next, it calculates the number of 5 yen coins that can be obtained by dividing X by 5 and assigns it to the variable goen.
Finally, it prints the sum of 1000*gohyaku and 5*goen as output.
