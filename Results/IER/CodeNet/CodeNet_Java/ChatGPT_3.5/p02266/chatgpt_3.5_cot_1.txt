<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "\\//". The code initializes three stacks: stackDown, stackArea, and stackEdge. It also initializes totalArea, pos, and lv to 0.

The code then iterates through each character in the input string. If the character is '\\', it decrements lv and pushes the current position (pos) to stackDown. If the character is '/', it increments lv and checks if stackDown is empty. If it is not empty, it pops the start position from stackDown and calculates the temporary area as pos - start. It adds the temporary area to totalArea and checks if stackArea is empty. If it is empty, it pushes the temporary area to stackArea and pushes lv to stackEdge. If stackArea is not empty, it pops elements from stackArea and stackEdge until stackEdge is empty or the top element of stackEdge is less than lv. It adds the popped areas to lastArea and pushes lastArea + temporary area to stackArea. It also pushes lv to stackEdge. If stackDown is empty, it checks if stackArea is empty. If it is not empty, it pops the top element from stackEdge and pushes lv to stackEdge.

After iterating through all the characters, the code prints the value of totalArea. It then prints the size of stackArea and the elements in stackArea separated by a space.
