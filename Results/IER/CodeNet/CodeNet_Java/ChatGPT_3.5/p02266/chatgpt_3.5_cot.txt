<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable `profile`. It then initializes three stacks: `stackDown`, `stackArea`, and `stackEdge`. It also initializes the variables `totalArea`, `pos`, and `lv` to 0.

The code then iterates through each character in the `profile` string. If the character is a backslash (`\`), it decrements the `lv` variable and pushes the current position (`pos`) onto the `stackDown` stack. If the character is a forward slash (`/`), it increments the `lv` variable and checks if the `stackDown` stack is empty. If it is not empty, it pops the top element from the `stackDown` stack and calculates the area between the current position (`pos`) and the popped position. It adds this area to the `totalArea` variable. If the `stackArea` stack is empty, it pushes the calculated area onto the `stackArea` stack and pushes the current `lv` value onto the `stackEdge` stack. If the `stackArea` stack is not empty, it pops elements from the `stackArea` and `stackEdge` stacks until the top element of the `stackEdge` stack is less than the current `lv` value. It adds the popped areas to a `lastArea` variable and pushes the sum of `lastArea` and the calculated area onto the `stackArea` stack. It also pushes the current `lv` value onto the `stackEdge` stack.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of `totalArea`. It then prints the size of the `stackArea` stack, followed by the elements of the `stackArea` stack separated by spaces.
