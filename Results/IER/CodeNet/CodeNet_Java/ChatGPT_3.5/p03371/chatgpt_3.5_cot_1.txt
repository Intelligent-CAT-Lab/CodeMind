The code takes 5 integers as input: a, b, c, x, and y.
It then checks if the sum of a and b is less than twice the value of c. If it is, it calculates the result as x multiplied by a plus y multiplied by b.
If the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to twice the value of c, it calculates the result as follows:
- It finds the minimum value between x and y and assigns it to the variable min.
- It finds the maximum value between x and y and assigns it to the variable max.
- It initializes the variable res to 0.
- It adds 2 times the value of c multiplied by min to res.
- If max is equal to x, it adds the minimum value between a and twice the value of c multiplied by (max - min) to res.
- If max is equal to y, it adds the minimum value between b and twice the value of c multiplied by (max - min) to res.
Finally, it prints the value of res as the output.
In this case, a = 1500, b = 2000, c = 1600, x = 3, and y = 2.
The sum of a and b is 3500, which is greater than twice the value of c (3200).
The minimum value between x and y is 2 and the maximum value is 3.
The result is calculated as follows:
res = 2 * 1600 + min(a, 2 * 1600) * (max - min) = 3200 + min(1500, 3200) * (3 - 2) = 3200 + 1500 * 1 = 4700.
Therefore, the output is 4700.
