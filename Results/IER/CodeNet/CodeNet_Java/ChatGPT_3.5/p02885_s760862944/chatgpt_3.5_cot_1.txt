<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input using the Scanner class.
It then calculates the value of result by subtracting 2 times B from A.
If the value of result is less than or equal to 0, it sets result to 0.
Finally, it prints the value of result as the output.
In this case, A is 12 and B is 4.
So, result = 12 - (2 * 4) = 12 - 8 = 4.
Since result is not less than or equal to 0, the value of result is printed as the output.
<<<Output>>>
4
