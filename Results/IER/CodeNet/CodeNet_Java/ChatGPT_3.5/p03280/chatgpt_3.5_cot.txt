<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input and subtracts 1 from each of them. Then it multiplies the two resulting integers and prints the result.
In this case, the input is "2 2". So, the first integer k will be 2-1 = 1 and the second integer b will also be 2-1 = 1. Then the code multiplies k and b, which is 1*1 = 1.
