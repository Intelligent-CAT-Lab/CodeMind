<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input and subtracts 1 from each of them. Then it multiplies the two resulting integers and prints the result.
In this case, the input is "2 2". The first integer is 2, so k = 2-1 = 1. The second integer is also 2, so b = 2-1 = 1. The code then calculates k*b = 1*1 = 1.
Finally, it prints the result, which is 1.
