<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b.
It calculates the value of ans by dividing (b-1) by (a-1).
Then it checks if (b-1) modulo (a-1) is equal to 0. If it is, it prints ans. Otherwise, it prints ans+1.
In this case, a is 4 and b is 10.
So, ans = (10-1)/(4-1) = 3.
Since (10-1) modulo (4-1) is not equal to 0, the code will print ans+1, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
