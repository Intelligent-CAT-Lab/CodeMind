<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b. It calculates the value of ans using the formula (b-1)/(a-1). Then it checks if (b-1)%(a-1) is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the value of ans. Otherwise, it prints the value of ans+1.
In this case, a=4 and b=10. So, ans = (10-1)/(4-1) = 3/3 = 1. Since (10-1)%(4-1) = 9%3 = 0, the condition is true and the output will be 1.
