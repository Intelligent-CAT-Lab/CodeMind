<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n. It then calls the calc() method passing n as an argument. The calc() method is a recursive method that calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of 1, 6, and 9 to equal n. It uses memoization to store the calculated values to avoid redundant calculations.

In the calc() method, if n is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it checks if the value of memo[n] is already calculated. If it is, it returns the stored value. Otherwise, it initializes res with n.

Then, it iterates through the powers of 6 and 9, starting from 1 and increasing the power until it exceeds n. For each power, it recursively calls the calc() method with n minus the power and adds 1 to the result. It takes the minimum of the current res and the calculated result.

Finally, it stores the minimum value in memo[n] and returns it.

In the main method, it takes an integer input n and calls the calc() method passing n as an argument. It then prints the result.
