The variable n is initialized with 15 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 15.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 7 to check each integer a in this range. The value of variable a is also passed to variable b, which is calculated as n - a.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current integers a and b by calling the digit() method. The digit() method extracts the digits of number with a while loop and adds them to variable r. The sum is then compared with the current value of variable ans, and the smaller value is assigned to ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
