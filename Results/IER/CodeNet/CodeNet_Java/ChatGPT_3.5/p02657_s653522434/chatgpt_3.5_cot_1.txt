<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the console. It then reads two integers a and b using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object. The values of a and b are multiplied together and the result is printed using the println() method.

In this case, the input is "2 5". The first integer 2 is assigned to variable a and the second integer 5 is assigned to variable b. The product of a and b is 2 * 5 = 10.

<<<Output>>>
10
