<<<Analysis>>>
The variables h, w, x, and y are initialized with the values 3, 5, 1, and 4 respectively according to the input.
The code then checks if the product of h and w is odd and if the sum of x and y is odd. If both conditions are true, it prints "No", otherwise it prints "Yes".
In this case, (3*5) = 15 is odd and (1+4) = 5 is odd, so the conditions are not met and the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
