<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and k from the input. Then it calls the partition method passing n and k as arguments.
The partition method calculates the number of ways to represent n as the sum of k non-negative integers.
It initializes a 2D array dp with size (n+1) x (k+1) and sets dp[0][0] to 1.
Then it fills in the values of dp using a nested loop. For each i from 1 to n and each j from 2 to k, it calculates dp[i][j] based on the previous values of dp.
Finally, it returns dp[n][k] as the output.
In this case, n=5 and k=3, so the code will calculate the number of ways to represent 5 as the sum of 3 non-negative integers.
