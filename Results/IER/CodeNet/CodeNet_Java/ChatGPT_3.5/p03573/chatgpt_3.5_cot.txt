<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: A, B, and C. It then checks if A is equal to B. If it is, it prints the value of C. If A is not equal to B, it checks if B is equal to C. If it is, it prints the value of A. If neither A is equal to B nor B is equal to C, it prints the value of B.
In this case, A = 5, B = 7, and C = 5. Since A is not equal to B and B is not equal to C, the code will print the value of B, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
