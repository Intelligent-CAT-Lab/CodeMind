<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input.
It checks if A is equal to B. If it is, it prints the value of C.
If A is not equal to B, it checks if B is equal to C. If it is, it prints the value of A.
If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints the value of B.
In this case, A is not equal to B and B is equal to C, so the output will be the value of A, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
