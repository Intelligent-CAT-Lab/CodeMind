<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input S and calculates the number of hours, minutes, and seconds in S. 
First, it calculates the number of hours by dividing S by 3600 and assigns the result to the variable hour.
Then, it calculates the remaining seconds after removing the hours by taking the modulus of S with 3600 and assigns the result to the variable min.
Finally, it calculates the remaining seconds after removing the minutes by taking the modulus of S with 3600 and 60 and assigns the result to the variable sec.
After the calculations, it prints the values of hour, min, and sec in the format "hour:min:sec".
