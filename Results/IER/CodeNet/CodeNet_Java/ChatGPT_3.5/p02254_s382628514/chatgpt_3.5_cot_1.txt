<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and initializes an array alphabets of size 26 to store the frequency of each alphabet in the input string. It then iterates through the input string and increments the corresponding index in the alphabets array for each character encountered.

Next, it creates a PriorityQueue called pq and adds a Node object for each non-zero frequency in the alphabets array. Each Node object contains the frequency and the corresponding character.

If the size of pq is 1, it means there is only one distinct character in the input string. In this case, it prints the length of the input string and returns.

Otherwise, it enters a while loop that continues until pq has only one element. In each iteration, it removes the two nodes with the lowest frequencies from pq, creates a new Node object with the sum of their frequencies, and adds it back to pq.

After the while loop, it retrieves the root of the Huffman tree from pq and performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree to calculate the length of each character's encoding. The length is stored in the len array.

Finally, it calculates the result by multiplying the frequency of each character in the input string with its corresponding length in the len array, and prints the result.
