<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input from the user and stores it in the variable `line`. It then extracts the values of `a` and `b` from the input by using the `substring` method and converting them to integers using `parseInt`.

The code then calls the `egcd` method with `a` and `b` as arguments. This method implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. It returns an array containing the values of `x2` and `y2`, which are the coefficients of `a` and `b` respectively in the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.

Finally, the code prints the values of `x2` and `y2` as output.

In this case, `a` is 4 and `b` is 12. The GCD of 4 and 12 is 4. The coefficients `x2` and `y2` are calculated as -2 and 1 respectively. Therefore, the output of the code would be "-2 1".
