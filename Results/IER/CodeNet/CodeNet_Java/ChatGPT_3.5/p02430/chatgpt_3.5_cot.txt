<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It then iterates through all possible combinations of k bits in a binary number with n digits. For each combination, it checks if the number of set bits (1s) is equal to k. If it is, it prints the combination as a binary number and the indices of the set bits. The indices are printed in increasing order.

For example, if n=5 and k=3, the code will iterate through the numbers from 0 to 31 (2^5-1) and check if the number of set bits is equal to 3. If it is, it will print the binary number and the indices of the set bits.
