<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 and variable k is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2^5-1 (31) to check each bit pattern of length n.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the number of set bits in the current bit pattern is equal to k. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration.
If the number of set bits is equal to k, it prints the current bit pattern followed by a colon.
Then it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each bit of the current bit pattern. If the j-th bit is set, it prints the value of j.
After printing all the set bits, it prints a new line.
After the loop finishes, it exits the solve method.
