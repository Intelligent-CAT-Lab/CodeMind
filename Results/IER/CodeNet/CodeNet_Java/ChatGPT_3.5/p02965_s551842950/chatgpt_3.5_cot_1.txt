<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and m from the input. It initializes the variable mod with 998244353 and creates an array fact of size 3000001. It then calculates the factorial of each number from 0 to 3000000 and stores it in the fact array. 

Next, it calls the getAns method with parameters n, 3*m, and 2*m. The getAns method calculates and returns a value based on the parameters. 

After that, it initializes the variable ans with the value returned by the getAns method. It also initializes the variable sign with -1. 

Then, it enters a for loop where it iterates from numOnes = m+1 to n. Inside the loop, it checks if (3*m - numOnes) % 2 is not equal to 0. If it is not equal to 0, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, it adds a value to ans based on the choose method, getAns method, and sign variable. It also adds mod to ans and takes the modulus of ans with mod. 

Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
