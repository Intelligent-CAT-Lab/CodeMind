<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and stores it in a character array called `s`. It then creates an empty list called `list` to store non-'x' characters from the input string. If the size of `list` is 0, it means there are no non-'x' characters in the input string, so it prints "0" and returns. 

Next, the code checks if the characters in `list` are symmetric. It iterates from the beginning and end of `list` and compares the characters at each position. If any pair of characters are not equal, it means the string is not symmetric and it prints "-1" and returns.

If the string is symmetric, the code initializes a variable `res` to 0. It then iterates from the beginning and end of the input string `s` and compares the characters at each position. If the characters are not equal, it means they need to be changed to make the string symmetric. If the character at position `i` is 'x', it increments `i` by 1 to move to the next character. Otherwise, it decrements `j` by 1 to move to the previous character. In either case, it increments `res` by 1 to count the number of changes needed.

Finally, the code prints the value of `res` as the output.
