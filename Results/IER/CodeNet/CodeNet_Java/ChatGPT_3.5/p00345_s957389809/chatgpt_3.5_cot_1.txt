<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and performs some calculations to convert it into a fraction. 

First, it initializes variables o and p to -1, and variables all and sub to empty strings. 

Then, it iterates through each character in the input string. If the character is a '.', it sets the value of o to the current index. If the character is a '(', it sets the value of p to the current index and assigns the value of all to sub. If the character is a ')', it does nothing. Otherwise, it appends the character to the string all. 

After the loop, it calculates the values of d and l. d is the difference between the length of the input string and the index of o minus 1. l is the difference between the index of p and the index of o minus 1. 

If p is -1, it means there are no parentheses in the input string. In this case, it converts the string all to an integer and calculates 10 raised to the power of d. It then calls the print method with these values. 

If p is not -1, it means there are parentheses in the input string. In this case, it subtracts the integer value of sub from the integer value of all and calculates 10 raised to the power of d minus 10 raised to the power of l. It then calls the print method with these values. 

The print method calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y using the gcd method. It then divides x and y by their gcd and prints the result as a fraction.
