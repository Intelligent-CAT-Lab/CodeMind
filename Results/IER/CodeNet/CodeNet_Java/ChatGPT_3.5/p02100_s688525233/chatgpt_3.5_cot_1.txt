<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a polynomial expression as input in the form of a string. It then decomposes the polynomial expression into its individual terms and coefficients. It uses the decompose() method to split the polynomial expression into its components. It then iterates through the decomposed array and checks if each term is equal to zero for a given value of x. If a term is equal to zero, it adds the corresponding value of x to the ans array. Finally, it sorts the ans array and prints the polynomial expression with the values of x that make it equal to zero.
In this case, the input polynomial expression is "x^2+3x+2".
The decompose() method splits the polynomial expression into its components: [2, 3, 1].
The code then iterates through the decomposed array and checks if each term is equal to zero for a given value of x. In this case, the only value of x that makes the polynomial expression equal to zero is x = -1. Therefore, the ans array will contain [-1].
Finally, the code sorts the ans array and prints the polynomial expression with the values of x that make it equal to zero: (x-1).
<<<Output>>>
(x-1)
