<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three arrays: fact, inv, and invFact. It then calls the precalc() method to populate these arrays with precalculated values. 
The code then reads two integers, a and b, from the input. 
It initializes an array called ans with a length of a + b. 
It then initializes two variables, aEnded and bEnded, with a value of 0. 
The first element of the ans array is set to the inverse of 2. 
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to the length of the ans array. 
Inside the loop, it calculates the values of aEndsHere and bEndsHere using the C() method and the inv() method. 
It updates the values of aEnded and bEnded by adding the respective values of aEndsHere and bEndsHere. 
It then updates the current element of the ans array by adding the value of bEnded and subtracting the values of aEnded and bEnded multiplied by the inverse of 2. 
If the updated value of the current element is negative, it adds MOD to make it positive. 
Finally, the code prints each element of the ans array.
