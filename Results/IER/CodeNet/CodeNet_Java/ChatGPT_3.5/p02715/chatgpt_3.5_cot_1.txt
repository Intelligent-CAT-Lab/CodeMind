<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable res is initialized with 0 and variable MOD is initialized with 1000000007.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from K to 1. In each iteration, it calculates the value of x[i] using the formula K/i^N. Then it subtracts the values of x[j] from x[i] where j is a multiple of i. If the value of x[i] becomes negative, it adds MOD to make it positive. Then it calculates the value of res by adding i*x[i] to it. The final value of res is printed as output, which is 4.
