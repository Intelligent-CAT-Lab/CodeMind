<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input. It initializes a variable res with 0 and a constant MOD with the value 10^9 + 7.
Then it creates an array x of size K+1 and initializes all elements to 0.
It enters a for loop that iterates from K to 1. In each iteration, it calculates x[i] by calling a utility function fast_pow_mod with parameters K/i, N, and MOD.
Then it enters another for loop that iterates from i*2 to K with a step size of i. In each iteration, it subtracts x[j] from x[i] and if the result is negative, it adds MOD to it.
After the inner loop finishes, it calculates res by adding i*x[i] to it and takes the modulo of res with MOD.
Finally, it prints the value of res.
