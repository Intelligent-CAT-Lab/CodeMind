<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and initializes various arrays and variables. It then calls the countWays() method of the StringProcessor class to calculate the number of ways to split the string into substrings such that each substring contains at least one '1' and at most one '0'. The countWays() method uses dynamic programming to calculate the answer. Finally, the code prints the calculated answer as the output.

The countWays() method first calls the dfs() method to populate the opt[][] array with the maximum index that can be reached from each state (cntMove, cntOne). Then, it iterates over the opt[][] array and calls the dp() method to calculate the number of ways to split the string for each state. The dp() method uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

The dfs() method is a recursive function that explores all possible transitions from each state (cur, cntMove, cntOne). It updates the opt[][] array and calls itself recursively to explore all possible transitions.

The dp() method is also a recursive function that calculates the number of ways to split the string for each state (cur, cntOne, cntZero). It checks the base case where cur is equal to n and cntOne and cntZero are both zero. Otherwise, it calculates the answer by considering two possible transitions: moving to the next character in the string or splitting the string at the current position.
