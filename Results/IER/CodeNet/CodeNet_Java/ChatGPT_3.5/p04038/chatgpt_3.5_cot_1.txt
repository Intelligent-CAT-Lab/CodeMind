<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and K from the input. It then checks if K is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 and returns. Otherwise, it initializes an array dp of size n+1 and sets dp[0] to 1. It then enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n, and the inner loop iterates from j to n. Inside the inner loop, it updates dp[i+1] by adding dp[i] and checks if i is greater than or equal to j+1. If it is, it calculates dp[i] by multiplying it with the binomial coefficient C(n*K-i-j*(K-1)-1, K-2) modulo mod, where mod is 1000000007. Finally, it prints dp[n] multiplied by the factorial of n modulo mod.
