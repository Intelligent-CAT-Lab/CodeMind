<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and K. It then initializes a variable mod with the value 1000000007. It also initializes a 2D array fif with the result of calling the enumFIF method with arguments 4000005 and mod. 

If K is equal to 1, it prints 1 and returns. Otherwise, it initializes an array dp of size n+1 and sets dp[0] to 1. 

Then, it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n, and the inner loop iterates from j to n. Inside the inner loop, it checks if i+1 is less than or equal to n. If it is, it adds dp[i] to dp[i+1]. If dp[i+1] is greater than or equal to mod, it subtracts mod from dp[i+1]. 

Then, it checks if i is greater than or equal to j+1. If it is, it calculates dp[i] by multiplying dp[i] with the result of calling the C method with arguments n*K-i-j*(K-1)-1, K-2, mod, and fif. 

After the nested for loop, it prints dp[n] multiplied by the value at index n in the first row of the fif array, modulo mod. 

Finally, it flushes the output and prints the time taken for the execution of the code.
