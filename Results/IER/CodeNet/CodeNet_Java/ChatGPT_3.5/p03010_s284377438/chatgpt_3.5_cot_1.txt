<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. 
The code then initializes an array a of size 11 and sets the first element to 1. 
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to 10. 
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop with a label "outer". 
Inside the "outer" loop, it creates a set and adds the current value of v to it. 
Then it enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to i-1. 
Inside this loop, it checks if the current value of a[k] and a[k]+v are already in the set. If they are, it continues to the next iteration of the "outer" loop. 
If they are not, it adds a[k] and a[k]+v to the set. 
Then it enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to k-1. 
Inside this loop, it checks if the current value of a[k]+a[l] is already in the set. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the "outer" loop. 
If it is not, it adds a[k]+a[l] to the set. 
After the innermost loop finishes, it sets the value of a[i] to v and breaks out of the "outer" loop. 
This process is repeated for each value of i from 1 to 10. 
Then it initializes a 2D array g of size 10x10 and sets the values of g[i][j] for i < j to ms[i] * a[j]. 
The values of ms are precalculated and stored in an array. 
Finally, it prints the values of g in a matrix format.
