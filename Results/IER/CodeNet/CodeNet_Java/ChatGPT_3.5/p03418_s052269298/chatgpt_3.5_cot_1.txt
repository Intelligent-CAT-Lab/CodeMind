<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 and variable k is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It checks if k is equal to 0. Since k is not equal to 0, it skips the if condition.
It initializes variable answer with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from k+1 to n. In this case, it iterates from 3 to 5.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of answer by adding the result of two calculations:
1. n/b * (b-k): It calculates the integer division of n by b and multiplies it by (b-k).
2. Math.max(n%b - k + 1, 0): It calculates the maximum value between (n%b - k + 1) and 0. n%b calculates the remainder when n is divided by b.

After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable answer as output.
