<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions (s.length + 1) x 13, where s.length is the length of the input string. It also initializes an array map with values [0, 4, 8, 12, 3, 7, 11, 2, 6, 10, 1, 5, 9].

The code then sets dp[0][0] to 1, indicating that there is 1 way to form a number with no digits.

Next, it iterates over each character in the input string. For each character, it iterates over each possible remainder value j from 0 to 12.

If the character is '?', it means that the current digit can be any value from 0 to 9. So, it iterates over each possible digit k from 0 to 9. For each digit, it calculates the remainder l by subtracting k from j. If l is negative, it adds 13 to it to make it positive. Then, it adds dp[i-1][map[l]] to dp[i][j]. This means that the number formed by the current digits (up to index i) with remainder j can be formed by adding the current digit k to the number formed by the previous digits (up to index i-1) with remainder map[l]. If dp[i][j] becomes greater than or equal to M (1_000_000_007), it subtracts M from it.

If the character is not '?', it means that the current digit is a specific value. So, it calculates the remainder l by subtracting the integer value of the character from '0' from j. If l is negative, it adds 13 to it to make it positive. Then, it sets dp[i][j] to dp[i-1][map[l]]. This means that the number formed by the current digits (up to index i) with remainder j can be formed by adding the current digit to the number formed by the previous digits (up to index i-1) with remainder map[l].

After iterating over all characters and remainders, it prints dp[s.length][5], which represents the number of ways to form a number with remainder 5 using all the digits in the input string.
