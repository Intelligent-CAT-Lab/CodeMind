<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes the variable ans with 700. It then reads a string S from the input. It then enters a for loop that iterates 3 times. In each iteration, it checks if the character at index i in the string S is equal to 'o'. If it is, it adds 100 to the variable ans. After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as the output.

In this case, the string S is "oxo". In the first iteration of the loop, the character at index 0 is 'o', so 100 is added to ans. In the second iteration, the character at index 1 is 'x', so nothing is added to ans. In the third iteration, the character at index 2 is 'o', so another 100 is added to ans. Therefore, the final value of ans is 900.

<<<Output>>>
900
