<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 8 according to the input. And a BitSet object bs is created with a size of 32.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 0 to 31 to check each bit of the variable x. If the bit is 1, it sets the corresponding bit in the BitSet object bs.
After the loop finishes, it calls the printBitSet() method to print the bits in the BitSet object bs.
Then it flips all the bits in the BitSet object bs using the flip() method.
It calls the printBitSet() method again to print the flipped bits in the BitSet object bs.
Then it flips all the bits in the BitSet object bs again.
A new BitSet object bsa is created with a size of 32.
It enters a for loop and iterates from 0 to 30 to check each bit of the BitSet object bs. If the bit is 1, it sets the next bit in the BitSet object bsa.
It calls the printBitSet() method to print the bits in the BitSet object bsa.
Then it creates a new BitSet object bsa with a size of 32.
It enters a for loop and iterates from 0 to 30 to check each bit of the BitSet object bs. If the next bit is 1, it sets the current bit in the BitSet object bsa.
It calls the printBitSet() method to print the bits in the BitSet object bsa.
