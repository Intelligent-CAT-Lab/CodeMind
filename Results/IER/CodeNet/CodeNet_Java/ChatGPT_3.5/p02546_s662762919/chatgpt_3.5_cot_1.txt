<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then checks if the input string ends with the letter "s". If it does, it concatenates the string "es" to the input string and prints the result. If it doesn't end with "s", it simply concatenates the letter "s" to the input string and prints the result.
In this case, the input string is "apple" which does not end with "s". Therefore, the code will concatenate "s" to "apple" and print the result as "apples".
<<<Output>>>
apples
