<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4 and variable x is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It checks if x is equal to 1 or 2*N-1. In this case, x is equal to 4 which is not equal to 1 or 2*N-1, so it prints "Yes".
Then it calls the solve() method passing N and x as arguments. Inside the solve() method, it initializes an array ans of size 2*N-1.
Since x is not equal to 2, it enters the else block. It assigns 1 to ans[N-2], x to ans[N-1], 2*N-1 to ans[N], and 2 to ans[N+1].
Then it initializes a variable elm with 3 and enters a for loop that iterates over the array ans. If the current element is 0, it assigns elm to it and increments elm by 1.
After the loop finishes, it returns the array ans.
Finally, it prints each element of the array ans on a new line.
