<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4 and variable x is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It checks if x is equal to 1 or 2*N-1. In this case, x is equal to 4 which is not equal to 1 or 2*N-1, so it prints "Yes".
Then it calls the solve() method passing N and x as arguments. Inside the solve() method, it initializes an array ans with size 2*N-1.
Since x is equal to 4, it enters the else block and assigns values to the elements of the ans array.
ans[N-2] = 1
ans[N-1] = x = 4
ans[N] = 2*N-1 = 7
ans[N+1] = 2
Then it initializes a variable elm with 3 and iterates over the ans array. If the current element is 0, it assigns the value of elm to it and increments elm by 1.
After the loop finishes, it returns the ans array.
