<<<Analysis>>>
The variable t is initialized with 1 according to the input. Then it enters a while loop and it iterates once because t is decremented by 1. Inside the loop, it calls the solve() method of the Solver class passing the input value n as argument. The solve() method returns an array of integers which is stored in the variable ans. Then it prints each element of the ans array followed by a space.
<<<Output>>>
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
