The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. 
Then it checks if a is less than b. If it is, it swaps the values of a and b.
Then it initializes an array dyn1 with size n+2 and sets the first element to 1.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to n+1. Inside the loop, it initializes a variable v with the value of dyn1[i-1].
Then it enters another for loop and iterates from i-b-1 to 0. Inside this loop, it adds the value of dyn1[j] to v.
After the inner loop finishes, it sets the value of dyn1[i] to v.
Then it initializes four arrays res1, res2, res1g and res2g with size n+1 and sets the first element of res1 and res2 to 1.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 0 to n. Inside this loop, it enters another for loop and iterates from 1 to n-i. Inside this inner loop, it checks if j is greater than or equal to a. If it is, it sets a reference variable cres2 to res2g, otherwise it sets cres2 to res2. Then it adds the product of res1[i] and dyn1[j-1+(i==0?1:0)+(i+j==n?1:0)] to cres2[i+j]. It also adds the product of res1g[i] and dyn1[j-1+(i==0?1:0)+(i+j==n?1:0)] to res2g[i+j].
After the inner loop finishes, it enters another for loop and iterates from 1 to b-1. Inside this loop, it adds the value of res2[i] to res1[i+j] and adds the value of res2g[i] to res1g[i+j].
After the outer loop finishes, it prints the value of add(res1g[n], res2g[n]) as output.
