<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and initializes two variables, c and len, to 0. It then iterates through each character of the input string.
If the current character is 'T', it decrements the value of c by 1. Otherwise, if c is less than 0, it subtracts c from len and sets c to 1. If c is greater than or equal to 0, it increments c by 1.
After the loop finishes, it adds the absolute value of c to len and prints the final value of len as the output.
In this case, the input string is "TSTTSS". Let's go through the code step by step:
1. The first character is 'T', so c becomes -1.
2. The second character is 'S', so c becomes 0.
3. The third character is 'T', so c becomes -1.
4. The fourth character is 'T', so c becomes -2.
5. The fifth character is 'S', so c becomes -1.
6. The sixth character is 'S', so c becomes 0.
7. The loop finishes and len becomes 1 (abs(-1)).
