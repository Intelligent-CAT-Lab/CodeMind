<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and converts it into a character array. It then checks if there is any occurrence of the characters 'A' followed by 'C' in the array. If such occurrence is found, it sets the flag variable 'flg' to true. Finally, it prints "Yes" if the flag is true, otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the input string is "BACD". The code will iterate through the character array and check each pair of characters. In this case, the pair 'A' and 'C' is found at index 1 and 2. Therefore, the flag variable will be set to true. The output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
