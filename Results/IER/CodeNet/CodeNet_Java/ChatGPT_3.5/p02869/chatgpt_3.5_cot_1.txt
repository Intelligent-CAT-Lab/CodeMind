The variable N and variable K are initialized with 1 according to the input. 
Then it calls the solve() method to calculate the values of the array ans.
Inside the solve() method, it first initializes the variable avg with the sum of K, K, N, N and -1.
Then it initializes a 2D array abi with N rows and 3 columns.
It then iterates from 0 to N-1 and calculates the values of a and b based on the formula avg - a.
It assigns the values of a and b to the corresponding elements of the array abi.
Next, it checks if N is odd or even. If N is odd, it sets the variable n to N. Otherwise, it sets n to N-1 and assigns Integer.MAX_VALUE to the third element of the last row of abi.
Then it checks if n/2 is even or odd. If it is even, it assigns the values of -n/2 to eve and n/2+1 to eveTime. It then iterates from 0 to eveTime-1 and assigns the values of eve to the third element of each row of abi, incrementing eve by 2 each time. After that, it assigns the values of -(n/2)+1 to odd and n/2 to oddTime. It then iterates from 0 to oddTime-1 and assigns the values of odd to the third element of each row of abi, incrementing odd by 2 each time.
If n/2 is odd, it assigns the values of -(n/2)+1 to eve and n/2 to eveTime. It then iterates from 0 to eveTime-1 and assigns the values of eve to the third element of each row of abi, incrementing eve by 2 each time. After that, it assigns the values of -n/2 to odd and n/2+1 to oddTime. It then iterates from 0 to oddTime-1 and assigns the values of odd to the third element of each row of abi, incrementing odd by 2 each time.
Next, it sorts the array abi based on the values of the third element in each row.
Then it iterates from 0 to n-1 and adds the values of the third element to the second element of each row of abi.
After that, it initializes a new 2D array ans with N rows and 3 columns.
It then iterates from 0 to N-1 and assigns the values of the corresponding elements of abi to the corresponding elements of ans, and assigns the value of K+N+N+i+1 to the third element of each row of ans.
Finally, it checks if the condition ans[i][0] + ans[i][1] > ans[i][2] is true for any row of ans. If it is true, it returns null. Otherwise, it returns ans.
Back in the main method, it assigns the return value of solve() to the variable ans.
If ans is not null, it creates a PrintWriter object pw and iterates through each row of ans. For each row, it prints the first element, a space, the second element, a space, and the third element, followed by a new line. Finally, it flushes the PrintWriter.
If ans is null, it prints -1.
