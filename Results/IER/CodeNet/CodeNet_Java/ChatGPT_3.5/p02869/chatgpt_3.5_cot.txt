<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized with 1 according to the input. 
Then it calls the solve() method to calculate the values of the array ans.
Inside the solve() method, it initializes the variable avg with the sum of K, K, N and N-1.
Then it initializes a 2D array abi with size N and each element is initialized with the values of a and b.
The value of a is calculated by adding K and i, and the value of b is calculated by subtracting a from avg.
Then it checks if N is odd or even. If N is odd, it sets the variable n to N. If N is even, it sets the variable n to N-1 and sets the value of abi[N-1][2] to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Then it checks if n/2 is even or odd. If n/2 is even, it sets the variable eve to -(n/2) and the variable eveTime to n/2+1. It then iterates from 0 to eveTime and sets the value of abi[i][2] to eve and increments eve by 2.
If n/2 is odd, it sets the variable eve to -(n/2)+1 and the variable eveTime to n/2. It then iterates from 0 to eveTime and sets the value of abi[i][2] to eve and increments eve by 2.
After that, it sorts the array abi based on the value of the third element in each subarray.
Then it iterates from 0 to n and adds the value of the third element in each subarray to the second element in each subarray.
Then it initializes a new 2D array ans with size N and copies the values from abi to ans.
Then it checks if the sum of the first and second element in each subarray in ans is greater than the third element. If it is, it returns null. Otherwise, it returns ans.
Finally, it checks if ans is null. If it is not null, it prints the values in ans. Otherwise, it prints -1.
