<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three variables a, b, and c with 0. It also creates an array bar of size 3 to store the values of a, b, and c. 
Then it creates a BufferedReader object to read the input from the user. 
It reads a line of input and splits it into three parts using the space as a delimiter. 
It converts the three parts into integers and assigns them to variables a, b, and c. 
If any exception occurs during this process, the values of a, b, and c are set to 0. 
Then it sorts the array bar in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method. 
Finally, it prints the values of bar[0], bar[1], and bar[2] separated by spaces. 
In this case, the values of a, b, and c are 3, 8, and 1 respectively. 
After sorting the array bar, the values will be 1, 3, and 8. 
So the output will be "1 3 8".
<<<Output>>>
1 3 8
