<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a double value from the input and assigns it to variable L. Then it calculates the cube of L/3.0 and assigns it to variable ans. Finally, it prints the value of ans with 12 decimal places.
In this case, the input value is 3. So, L = 3. The code calculates ans = (3/3.0)^3 = 1.0^3 = 1.0.
The output will be 1.000000000000.
<<<Output>>>
1.000000000000
