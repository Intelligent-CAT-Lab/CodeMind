<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 4 and 1 respectively according to the input.
Since n is even, it enters the else block.
It initializes two variables i and j with n/2 and n/2+1 respectively.
Then it enters a while loop and it checks if the difference between j and i is less than n/2 and m is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it prints the values of i and j using the Util.join() method.
Then it decrements i by 1, increments j by 1 and decrements m by 1.
After the while loop, it increments j by 1.
Then it enters another while loop and it checks if m is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it prints the values of i and j using the Util.join() method.
Then it decrements i by 1, increments j by 1 and decrements m by 1.
After the while loop, the program terminates.
