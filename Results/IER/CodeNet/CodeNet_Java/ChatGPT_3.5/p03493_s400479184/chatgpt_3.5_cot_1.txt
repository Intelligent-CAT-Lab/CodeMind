<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and splits it into an array of strings, where each element of the array contains one character of the input string. Then it initializes a variable count with 0.
It checks each element of the array and if the element is equal to "1", it increments the count by 1.
Finally, it prints the value of count as the output.
In this case, the input string is "101". After splitting it into an array, the array will contain ["1", "0", "1"].
The first and third elements of the array are equal to "1", so the count will be 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
