<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable count is initialized with 0. A StringBuilder object sb is created to store the output.
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 1 to n-1 for variable i and from i+1 to n for variable j. 
Inside the nested for loop, it checks if the current value of i and j satisfy certain conditions based on the value of n.
If n is even, it checks if i+j is equal to n+1. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If n is odd, it checks if i+j is equal to n. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If the conditions are not met, it appends the current values of i and j to the StringBuilder object sb and increments the count variable.
After the nested loop finishes, it prints the value of count as output, which is the number of pairs of i and j that satisfy the conditions.
Then it prints the content of the StringBuilder object sb, which contains the pairs of i and j that satisfy the conditions.
