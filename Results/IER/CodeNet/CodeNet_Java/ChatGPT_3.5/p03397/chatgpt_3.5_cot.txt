<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes a 2D array called "go" which stores the next states based on the current state and the input character. The code also initializes a string called "win" which represents the winning pattern. It then initializes an array called "dp" with the length of "win" and sets the start state to 1. It then iterates through each character in the input string and updates the "dp" array based on the current state and the input character. Finally, it calculates the sum of the "dp" array elements that correspond to winning states and returns the result modulo "mod".

In this case, the input string is "1??00". The code will iterate through each character in the string and update the "dp" array accordingly. The final result will be the sum of the "dp" array elements that correspond to winning states, modulo "mod".

<<<Output>>>
The return value of "1??00" is 4.
