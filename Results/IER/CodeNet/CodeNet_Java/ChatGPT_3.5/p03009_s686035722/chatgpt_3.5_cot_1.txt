<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, h, and D. It then calculates the value of fs, which is the sum of factorials from 1 to n-1 modulo mod. 
It initializes an array ft of size h+5 and sets the first two elements to f and mod-f respectively. 
Then it enters a loop from 0 to h-1 and calculates the current sum of ft. If the current index plus D is greater than or equal to h, it adds the current sum to the answer. 
It then calculates the current value of cur by multiplying the current sum with fs modulo mod. 
It updates the ft array by adding cur to the current index and subtracting cur from the index plus D+1 if it is less than or equal to h. 
Finally, it prints the answer modulo mod.
