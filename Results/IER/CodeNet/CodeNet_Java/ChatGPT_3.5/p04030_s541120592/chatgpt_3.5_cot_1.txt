<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` and initializes an empty string `t`.
Then it iterates through each character of `s` using a for loop.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is 'B'. If it is, it removes the last character from `t` using the `substring` method.
If the current character is not 'B', it appends it to `t`.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of `t` as the output.
In this case, the input string is "01B0". 
The code will remove the last character 'B' from `t` and the final value of `t` will be "01".
<<<Output>>>
01
