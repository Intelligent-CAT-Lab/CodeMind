<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable m is initialized with 3 according to the input.
Then it creates a 3D array dp with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1) x (n+1) and initializes all elements to 0.
Then it sets dp[m][1][0] to 1.
Then it enters a nested for loop with i iterating from m to 1, j iterating from 0 to n, and t iterating from 0 to n.
Inside the nested for loop, it updates the values of dp[i-1][j][t], dp[i-1][j][t+1], and dp[i-1][j+t][0] based on the values of dp[i][j][t].
Finally, it prints the value of dp[0][n][0] as the output.
