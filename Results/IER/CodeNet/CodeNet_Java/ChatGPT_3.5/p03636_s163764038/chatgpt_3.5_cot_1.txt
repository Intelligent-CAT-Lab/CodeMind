<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string from the user and stores it in the variable `str`. It then calculates the length of the string and stores it in the variable `n`. It also extracts the first character of the string and stores it in the variable `h`, and extracts the last character of the string and stores it in the variable `t`. Finally, it prints the concatenation of `h`, `n-2`, and `t` as the output.

In this case, the input string is "internationalization". The length of the string is 20. The first character is "i" and the last character is "n". Therefore, the output will be "i18n".

<<<Output>>>
i18n
