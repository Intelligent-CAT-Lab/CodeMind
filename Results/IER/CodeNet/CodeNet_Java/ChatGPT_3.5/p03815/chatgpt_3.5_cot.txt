<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input `x` and performs some calculations to determine the return value. 
First, it divides `x` by 11 and multiplies the result by 2, storing it in the variable `answer`. 
Then, it calculates the remainder of `x` divided by 11 and stores it in the variable `mod`. 
Next, it calculates the integer division of `x` by 11 and stores it in the variable `step`. 
If `mod` is greater than 0, it checks if `mod` is less than or equal to 6 minus the remainder of `step` divided by 2. 
If this condition is true, it increments `answer` by 1. Otherwise, it increments `answer` by 2. 
Finally, it prints the value of `answer` as the return value.
