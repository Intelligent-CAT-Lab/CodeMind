<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 7 according to the input. And variable answer is initialized with 0.
It calculates the integer division of x by 11 and multiplies the result by 2, and assigns it to variable answer.
Then it calculates the remainder of x divided by 11 and assigns it to variable mod.
Then it calculates the integer division of x by 11 and assigns it to variable step.
If mod is greater than 0, it checks if mod is less than or equal to 6 minus the remainder of step divided by 2. If it is, it increments answer by 1. Otherwise, it increments answer by 2.
Finally, it prints the value of answer as output.
<<<Output>>>
