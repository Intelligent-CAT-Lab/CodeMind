<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: an integer a, a string s, and another integer b. It then checks the value of the string s. If s is equal to "+", it adds a and b and stores the result in variable c. If s is equal to "-", it subtracts b from a and stores the result in variable c. Finally, it prints the value of c as the output.
In this case, the input is "1 + 2". So, a is 1, s is "+", and b is 2. Since s is equal to "+", the code adds a and b, which gives 3. Therefore, the output will be 3.
