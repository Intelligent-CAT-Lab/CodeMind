<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: an integer a, a string s, and another integer b. It then checks the value of the string s. If s is equal to "+", it adds a and b and assigns the result to variable c. If s is equal to "-", it subtracts b from a and assigns the result to variable c. Finally, it prints the value of c as the output.
In this case, the input values are a=1, s="+", and b=2. Since s is equal to "+", the code will add a and b, resulting in c=3.
