<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: W, H, and C. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of W and H using the gcd() method. It stores the gcd in the variable WH. 

Next, it calculates the value of a by dividing W by WH and multiplying it by H divided by WH. 

Finally, it multiplies a by C and prints the result as the output.

In this case, W = 10, H = 20, and C = 5. The gcd of 10 and 20 is 10. 

So, a = (10/10) * (20/10) = 1 * 2 = 2.

The output will be 2 * 5 = 10.
