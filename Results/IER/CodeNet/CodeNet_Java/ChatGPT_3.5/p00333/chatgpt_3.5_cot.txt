<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: W, H, and C. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of W and H using the gcd() method. It stores the GCD in the variable WH. 

Next, it calculates the value of a by dividing W by WH and multiplying it by H divided by WH. 

Finally, it multiplies the value of a by C and prints the result as the output.

In this case, the input values are 10, 20, and 5. The GCD of 10 and 20 is 10. So, the value of a is (10/10) * (20/10) = 2 * 2 = 4. 

The output will be 4 * 5 = 20.
