<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the value 15 according to the input. An array `list` of size S+1 is created. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is divisible by 3 or 5. If it is not divisible by either 3 or 5, it adds the current integer i to the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output.
