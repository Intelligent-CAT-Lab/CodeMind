<<<Analysis>>>
The code uses a custom FastScanner class to read input from the user. It then subtracts the second input from the first input and takes the maximum of the result and 0. Finally, it prints the result.

In this case, the first input is 100 and the second input is 17. So, the code will subtract 17 from 100, resulting in 83. Since 83 is greater than 0, the maximum value will be 83. Therefore, the output will be 83.

<<<Output>>>
83
