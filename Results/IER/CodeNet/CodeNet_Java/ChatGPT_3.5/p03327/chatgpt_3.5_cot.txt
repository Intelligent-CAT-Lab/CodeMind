<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an instance of the `hayami` class and calls the `saori_hayami()` method to get the input value `n`. 
If `n` is less than 1000, it prints "ABC". Otherwise, it prints "ABD".
The `saori_hayami()` method reads the input from the standard input stream and converts it to an integer.
The `hayami` class is responsible for reading the input byte by byte and converting it to the appropriate data type.
The `hayami_saori()` method checks if the current byte is within the range of printable ASCII characters.
The `nextHayami()` method reads the input byte by byte and appends it to a StringBuilder until a non-printable ASCII character is encountered.
The `saorihayami()` method reads the input byte by byte and converts it to a long integer.
The `saori_hayami()` method calls `saorihayami()` and checks if the value is within the range of an integer.
<<<Output>>>
ABC
