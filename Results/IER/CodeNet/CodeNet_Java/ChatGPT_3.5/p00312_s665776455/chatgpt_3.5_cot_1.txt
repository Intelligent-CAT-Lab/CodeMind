<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input from the user using BufferedReader and InputStreamReader. It then enters a while loop which continues until there is no more input to read. Inside the loop, it splits the input string by space and stores the two values in variables D and L. 

Next, it checks if D is divisible by L using the condition D % L == 0. If it is, it prints the result of D / L. Otherwise, it prints the result of D / L + D % L.

In this case, D = 10 and L = 5. Since 10 is divisible by 5, the condition D % L == 0 is true. Therefore, the output will be 10 / 5 = 2.
