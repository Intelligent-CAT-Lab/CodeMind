<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input integer n and passes it to the function digits(). The function digits() calculates the sum of the digits of n by repeatedly extracting the digits of n and adding them to the variable sum. The calculated sum is then returned.
In the main function, the sum of digits is calculated by calling the digits() function with the input n. Then, it checks if n is divisible by the sum of digits using the modulo operator (%). If the result is 0, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input is 12. The sum of digits of 12 is 1+2=3. Since 12 is not divisible by 3, the output will be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
