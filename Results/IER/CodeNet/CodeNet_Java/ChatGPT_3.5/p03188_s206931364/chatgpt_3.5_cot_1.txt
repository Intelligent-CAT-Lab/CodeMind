The variable k is initialized with 2 according to the input. Then the variable n is set to the minimum value between k and 500, which is 2. 
A 2D array temp of size n x n is created. 
Then a for loop is used to iterate from n-1 to 0. Inside the loop, there is an if-else condition. 
If i+1 is less than k, then another for loop is used to iterate from 0 to n-1 with a step of 2. 
Inside this loop, the value of temp[i][j] is set to k. Then k is decremented. 
After that, another for loop is used to iterate from 1 to n-1 with a step of 2. 
Inside this loop, the value of temp[i][j] is set to k. Then k is decremented. 
If i+1 is not less than k, then a for loop is used to iterate from 0 to n-1. 
Inside this loop, the value of temp[i][j] is set to k. Then k is decremented. 
After the first for loop finishes, another 2D array answer of size n x n is created. 
Then two nested for loops are used to iterate through each element of the answer array. 
Inside the nested loops, the value of answer[j][(i + j) % n] is set to temp[i][j]. 
Finally, the value of n is printed, followed by each row of the answer array.
