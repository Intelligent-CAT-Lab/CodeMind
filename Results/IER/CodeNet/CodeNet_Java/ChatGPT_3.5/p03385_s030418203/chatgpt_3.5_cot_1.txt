<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable "string". It then checks if the string contains the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' using the contains() method. If all three characters are present, the boolean variable "b" is set to true, otherwise it is set to false. Finally, it prints "Yes" if "b" is true, and "No" if "b" is false.

In this case, the input is "bac". The string contains all three characters 'a', 'b', and 'c', so the boolean variable "b" is set to true. Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
