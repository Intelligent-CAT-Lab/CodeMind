The variable w is initialized with 25 according to the input. And variable base3 is initialized as an empty string.
It enters a while loop and it continues until the value of w becomes 0. Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of w divided by 3 and stores it in variable r.
Then it checks the value of r. If r is 0, it adds "0" to the beginning of the base3 string and divides w by 3. If r is 1, it adds "+" to the beginning of the base3 string and divides w by 3. If r is 2, it adds "-" to the beginning of the base3 string, divides w by 3 and increments w by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of base3 as output, which is "+--".
<<<Output>>>
+--
