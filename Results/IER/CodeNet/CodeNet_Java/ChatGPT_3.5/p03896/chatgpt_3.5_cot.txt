<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and performs some calculations based on its value. If `n` is equal to 2, it prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, it creates a 2D array `ans` of size `n` by `n-1` and fills it with values based on the following rules:
- For each row `i` from 0 to `n-2`, for each column `j` from 0 to `n-2`, if `i` is equal to `j`, it assigns the value `n` to `ans[i][j]`, otherwise it assigns the value `j+1` to `ans[i][j]`.
- For the last row `n-1`, for each column `i` from 0 to `n-2`, it assigns the value `(i+1)%(n-1)+1` to `ans[n-1][i]`.
Finally, it prints the values of the array `ans` row by row.
In this case, the input `n` is 7, so the code will create a 2D array `ans` of size 7 by 6 and fill it with the values according to the rules mentioned above.
