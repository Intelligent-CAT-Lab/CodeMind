<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input.
It checks if n is equal to 2. If it is, it prints -1 and returns.
Otherwise, it creates a 2D array ans with dimensions n x (n-1).
It then fills the array ans with values according to the following rules:
- For each row i and column j, if i is equal to j, it assigns the value of n to ans[i][j].
- Otherwise, it assigns the value of j+1 to ans[i][j].
After filling the array, it assigns values to the last row of ans according to the following rule:
- For each column i, it assigns the value of (i+1)%(n-1)+1 to ans[n-1][i].
Finally, it prints the values of the array ans.
