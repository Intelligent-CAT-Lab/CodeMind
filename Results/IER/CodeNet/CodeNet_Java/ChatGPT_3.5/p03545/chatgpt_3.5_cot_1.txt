<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and stores each character of the string in an array of strings called "ch". Then it converts each element of the "ch" array to an integer and stores them in variables a, b, c, and d. 

Next, it initializes an array of strings called "ans" with a length of 3. It checks different combinations of addition and subtraction of a, b, c, and d to see if the sum is equal to 7. If a combination is found, it assigns the corresponding symbols "+" or "-" to the elements of the "ans" array.

Finally, it prints the values of a, b, c, and d along with the symbols from the "ans" array, forming an equation a + b + c + d = 7.

In this case, the input is "1222". So, a = 1, b = 2, c = 2, and d = 2. The sum of a, b, c, and d is 7. Therefore, the output will be "1+2+2+2=7".
<<<Output>>>
1+2+2+2=7
