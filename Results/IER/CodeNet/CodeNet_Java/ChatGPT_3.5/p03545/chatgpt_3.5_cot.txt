<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and stores it in the variable `str`. Then it creates an array `ch` of size 4 to store each character of the string separately. It uses a for loop to iterate from 0 to 3 and uses the `substring` method to extract each character from the string and store it in the `ch` array.

Then it converts each character in the `ch` array to an integer and stores them in variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

Next, it creates an array `ans` of size 3 to store the possible signs (+ or -) that can be placed between the numbers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` to make the sum equal to 7.

It checks all possible combinations of signs and calculates the sum of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` with different signs. If the sum is equal to 7, it assigns the corresponding signs to the `ans` array.

Finally, it prints the equation `a + ans[0] + b + ans[1] + c + ans[2] + d + "=7"`.

In this case, the input is "1222". So, `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 2`, and `d = 2`.

The sum of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` is 7. So, the signs in the `ans` array will be `+`, `+`, and `+`.

Therefore, the output will be `1+2+2+2=7`.
