The variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input. 
It calls the divisors() method passing n as argument. 
Inside the divisors() method, it initializes an empty list called list. 
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of n. 
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is not divisible, it continues to the next iteration. 
If it is divisible, it adds i to the list. 
Then it checks if i is not equal to 1 and i * i is not equal to n. If both conditions are true, it adds n/i to the list. 
After the for loop finishes, it returns the list of divisors. 
Back in the main method, it initializes an empty list called divs and assigns the returned list from the divisors() method to divs. 
It initializes a variable ans with 0. 
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates through each element div in the divs list. 
Inside the for loop, it checks if div is greater than 1000000. If it is, it continues to the next iteration. 
Then it checks if n is greater than div * div + div. If it is, it adds (n - div) / div to ans. 
After the for loop finishes, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 3.
