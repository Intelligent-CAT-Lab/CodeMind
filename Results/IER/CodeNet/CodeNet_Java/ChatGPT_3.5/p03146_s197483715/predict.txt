The variable s is initialized with 8 according to the input. A new HashMap object hmap is created. Then it calls the function func with parameters hmap, s, and 1. 
Inside the func function, it checks if the HashMap hmap contains the key a. Since it is the first call, the HashMap is empty and does not contain the key 8. So it proceeds to the next step.
It puts the key-value pair (a, i) into the HashMap hmap. In this case, it puts (8, 1) into the HashMap.
Then it calls the func function recursively with parameters hmap, solve(i+1, a), and i+1. In this case, it calls func(hmap, solve(2, 8), 2).
Inside the solve function, it checks if i is equal to 1. Since i is 2, it does not match the condition. 
Then it checks if a is divisible by 2. Since 8 is divisible by 2, it returns a/2, which is 4.
The func function is called again with parameters hmap, 4, and 2. In this case, it calls func(hmap, solve(3, 4), 3).
Inside the solve function, it checks if i is equal to 1. Since i is 3, it does not match the condition.
Then it checks if a is divisible by 2. Since 4 is divisible by 2, it returns a/2, which is 2.
The func function is called again with parameters hmap, 2, and 3. In this case, it calls func(hmap, solve(4, 2), 4).
Inside the solve function, it checks if i is equal to 1. Since i is 4, it does not match the condition.
Then it checks if a is divisible by 2. Since 2 is divisible by 2, it returns a/2, which is 1.
The func function is called again with parameters hmap, 1, and 4. In this case, it calls func(hmap, solve(5, 1), 5).
Inside the solve function, it checks if i is equal to 1. Since i is 5, it does not match the condition.
Then it checks if a is divisible by 2. Since 1 is not divisible by 2, it returns 3*a+1, which is 3*1+1=4.
The func function is called again with parameters hmap, 4, and 5. In this case, it calls func(hmap, solve(6, 4), 6).
Inside the solve function, it checks if i is equal to 1. Since i is 6, it does not match the condition.
Then it checks if a is divisible by 2. Since 4 is divisible by 2, it returns a/2, which is 2.
The func function is called again with parameters hmap, 2, and 6. In this case, it calls func(hmap, solve(7, 2), 7).
Inside the solve function, it checks if i is equal to 1. Since i is 7, it does not match the condition.
Then it checks if a is divisible by 2. Since 2 is divisible by 2, it returns a/2, which is 1.
The func function is called again with parameters hmap, 1, and 7. In this case, it calls func(hmap, solve(8, 1), 8).
Inside the solve function, it checks if i is equal to 1. Since i is 8, it does not match the condition.
Then it checks if a is divisible by 2. Since 1 is not divisible by 2, it returns 3*a+1, which is 3*1+1=4.
The func function is called again with parameters hmap, 4, and 8. In this case, it calls func(hmap, solve(9, 4), 9).
Inside the solve function, it checks if i is equal to 1. Since i is 9, it does not match the condition.
Then it checks if a is divisible by 2. Since 4 is divisible by 2, it returns a/2, which is 2.
The func function is called again with parameters hmap, 2, and 9. In this case, it calls func(hmap, solve(10, 2), 10).
Inside the solve function, it checks if i is equal to 1. Since i is 10, it does not match the condition.
Then it checks if a is divisible by 2.
