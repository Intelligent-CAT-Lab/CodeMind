The variable x is initialized with 10 and variable y is initialized with 20 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with the maximum value of long.
It checks four conditions using if statements:
1. If x is less than or equal to y, it calculates the difference between y and x and assigns it to ans if it is smaller than the current value of ans.
2. If -x is less than or equal to y, it calculates the sum of y and x plus 1 and assigns it to ans if it is smaller than the current value of ans.
3. If x is less than or equal to -y, it calculates the sum of -y and -x plus 1 and assigns it to ans if it is smaller than the current value of ans.
4. If -x is less than or equal to -y, it calculates the sum of -y and x plus 2 and assigns it to ans if it is smaller than the current value of ans.
After checking all the conditions, it prints the final value of ans as output.
In this case, the first condition is true, so the value of ans is updated to 10. Therefore, the output will be 10.
