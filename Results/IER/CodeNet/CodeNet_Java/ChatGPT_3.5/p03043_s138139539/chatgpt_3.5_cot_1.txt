<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 10 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable p by multiplying it with 0.5 until the value of variable tmp is greater than or equal to k.
Then it adds the value of p divided by n to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output.
<<<Output>>>
0.3125
