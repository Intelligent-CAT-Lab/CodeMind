<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs A, B, and C. It then calculates the value of N by dividing B by A. 
If N is greater than C, it prints the value of C. Otherwise, it prints the value of N.
In this case, A=2, B=11, and C=4. 
The value of N is calculated as 11/2 = 5. Since 5 is not greater than 4, the code will print the value of N, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
