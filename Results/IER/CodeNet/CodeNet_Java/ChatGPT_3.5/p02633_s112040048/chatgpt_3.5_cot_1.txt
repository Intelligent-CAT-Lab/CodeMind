<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `x` using the Scanner class. It initializes a variable `ans` with 0.
Then it calls the `lcm` method passing 360 and `x` as arguments. The `lcm` method calculates the least common multiple of 360 and `x` using the `gcd` method.
The `gcd` method calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using recursion.
Finally, the code prints the result of `lcm(360, x) / x` as the output.
In this case, `x` is 90. So the code will calculate the LCM of 360 and 90, which is 360. Then it will divide 360 by 90, resulting in 4.
