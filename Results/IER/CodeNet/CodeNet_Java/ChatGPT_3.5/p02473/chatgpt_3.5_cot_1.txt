<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two input numbers using the Scanner class and stores them in BigInteger objects a and b. Then it subtracts b from a using the subtract() method of the BigInteger class and assigns the result back to a. Finally, it prints the value of a.

In this case, the input numbers are 5 and 8. So, the code will subtract 8 from 5, resulting in -3. Therefore, the output will be -3.
<<<Output>>>
-3
