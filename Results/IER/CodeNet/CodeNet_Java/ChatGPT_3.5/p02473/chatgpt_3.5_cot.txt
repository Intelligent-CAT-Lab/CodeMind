<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two input values using the Scanner class and stores them in BigInteger variables a and b. Then it subtracts the value of b from a and assigns the result back to a. Finally, it prints the value of a.

In this case, the input values are 5 and 8. So, the code will subtract 8 from 5, resulting in -3. Therefore, the return value will be -3.

<<<Output>>>
-3
