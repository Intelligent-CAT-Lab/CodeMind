<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It calls the getPrimeFactors method passing n-1 as argument and stores the result in the variable primeFactors2.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to sqrt(n) to check each integer p in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it checks if p is a prime factor of n. If it is, it checks if p satisfies the condition check(p, n). If it does, it increments the variable ans by 1.
Then it calculates the value of variable a1 by multiplying the values of primeFactors2.
Finally, it prints the sum of a1 and ans as output.
