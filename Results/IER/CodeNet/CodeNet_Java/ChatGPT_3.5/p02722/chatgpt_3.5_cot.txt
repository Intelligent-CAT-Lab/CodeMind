<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input `n` and calculates the number of prime factors of `n-1` and stores it in the `primeFactors2` map.
Then it iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if `p` is a prime factor of `n`. If it is, it checks if `p` satisfies the condition `check(p, n)`. If it does, it increments the `ans` variable.
After the loop, it calculates the value of `a1` by multiplying the values of `entry.getValue() + 1` for each entry in the `primeFactors2` map.
Finally, it prints the sum of `a1` and `ans` as the output.
