<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized with 4 and 3 respectively according to the input. And a 2D array dp is initialized with size (N+1) x (K+1) and all elements are set to 0.
Then, dp[0][0] is set to 1.
Next, there are two nested for loops. The outer loop iterates from 1 to N and the inner loop iterates from 1 to K.
Inside the nested loops, the value of dp[i][j] is calculated based on the previous values of dp.
dp[i][j] is updated by adding two terms:
1. dp[i-1][j] * j: This represents the case where the i-th ball is put into one of the j boxes that already contain i-1 balls. There are j choices for the box to put the i-th ball.
2. dp[i-1][j-1] * j: This represents the case where the i-th ball is put into a new box, and there are j-1 boxes that already contain i-1 balls. Again, there are j choices for the box to put the i-th ball.
After each update, dp[i][j] is taken modulo 1000000007 to avoid overflow.
Finally, the value of dp[N][K] is printed as the output.
