<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable 'a'. Then it calculates the sum of 'a', 'a*a' (a squared), and 'a*a*a' (a cubed) and prints the result.
In this case, the input is 2. So the code will calculate 2 + (2*2) + (2*2*2) = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
