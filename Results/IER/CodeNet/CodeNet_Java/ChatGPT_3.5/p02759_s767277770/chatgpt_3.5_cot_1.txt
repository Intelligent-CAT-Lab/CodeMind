<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer N from the input. It then checks if N is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints N/2 as the output. If it is not, it prints N/2 + 1 as the output.
In this case, the input is 5. Since 5 is not divisible by 2, the code will print 5/2 + 1 = 3 as the output.
<<<Output>>>
3
