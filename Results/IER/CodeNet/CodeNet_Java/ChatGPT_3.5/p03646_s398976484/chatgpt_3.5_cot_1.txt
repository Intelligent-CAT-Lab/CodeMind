The variable K is initialized with 0 according to the input. And variable x and variable y are initialized with 0 and 0 respectively.
It creates an array a of size 50 to store the values.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 49 to assign values to each element of array a.
Inside the for loop, it assigns the value of i+y to the current element of array a.
Then it checks if i is greater than or equal to 50-x. If it is, it increments the value of the current element of array a by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of 50 as output.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 49 to print each element of array a.
