The code reads four integers a, b, c, and d from the input. It then calculates the sum of these four integers and stores it in the variable sum. 
Next, it calculates three different values s1, s2, and s3 by subtracting the double of the sum of two of the integers from the total sum. 
Finally, it finds the minimum value among s1, s2, and s3 and stores it in the variable min. 
The code then prints the value of min as the output.
In this case, the input is 2 1 3 4. So, the values of a, b, c, and d are 2, 1, 3, and 4 respectively. 
The sum of these four integers is 10. 
The values of s1, s2, and s3 are calculated as follows:
s1 = |10 - (2+1)*2| = |10 - 6| = 4
s2 = |10 - (2+3)*2| = |10 - 10| = 0
s3 = |10 - (2+4)*2| = |10 - 12| = 2
The minimum value among s1, s2, and s3 is 0. 
So, the output of the code execution would be 0.
