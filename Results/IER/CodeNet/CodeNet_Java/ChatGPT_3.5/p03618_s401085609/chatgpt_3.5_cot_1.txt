<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input string and converts it into a character array. It then initializes a variable 'l' with the length of the character array.
Next, it creates an array 'x' of size 26 to store the frequency of each character in the input string. It iterates over the character array and increments the corresponding index in the 'x' array.
After that, it calculates the sum of squares of each element in the 'x' array using a stream and maps each element to its square. The sum is then subtracted from 2+l*l and the result is divided by 2.
Finally, the result is printed as the output.

In this case, the input string is "aatt". The character array would be ['a', 'a', 't', 't'].
The length of the character array is 4.
The frequency array 'x' would be [2, 0, 0, ..., 0, 2, 0, ..., 0] (with 2 at index 0 and 2 at index 19).
The sum of squares of the elements in 'x' would be 2^2 + 2^2 = 8.
2 + 4^2 - 8 = 18.
18 divided by 2 is 9.

<<<Output>>>
9
