<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable ans and variable t are initialized with 0 and 1 respectively.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until h is greater than or equal to t. In each iteration, it adds the value of t to variable ans and multiplies the value of t by 2.
In the first iteration, t is 1 and ans is 0. So, ans becomes 1.
In the second iteration, t is 2 and ans is 1. So, ans becomes 3.
Since h is not greater than or equal to t anymore, the loop terminates.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
