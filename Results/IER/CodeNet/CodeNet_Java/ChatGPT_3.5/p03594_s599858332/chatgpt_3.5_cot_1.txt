The variable H, variable W and variable d are initialized with 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable mode is initialized with "RYGB".
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 for variable i and variable j. The value of variable v is calculated as (i + j) / d % 2 + (i + W - 1 - j) / d % 2 * 2.
Then it prints the character at index v % 4 in the string mode. The condition is met when i is 0, j is 0, 1 and i is 1, j is 0, 1.
After the loop finishes, it does not print anything as output.
