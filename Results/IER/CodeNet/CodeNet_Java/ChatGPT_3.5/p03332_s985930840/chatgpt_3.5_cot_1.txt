<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized with 4, 1, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable MOD is initialized with 998244353.
Then it initializes an array fact with size N+1 and an array factInv with size N+1. It sets fact[0] to 1 and then it calculates the factorial of each number from 1 to N and stores it in the fact array.
Then it calculates the inverse of each factorial value and stores it in the factInv array.
Next, it initializes an array comb with size N+1. It calculates the combination value for each i from 0 to N using the factorial and inverse factorial values and stores it in the comb array.
Then it initializes a variable ans with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N to check each integer i in this range. It calculates the value of variable b by subtracting A*i from K. If b is not divisible by B, it continues to the next iteration.
If b is divisible by B, it divides b by B and checks if it falls within the range [0, N]. If it does, it adds the product of comb[i] and comb[b] to the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans modulo MOD as output.
