<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable `mjs`. Then it checks the value of `mjs` using if-else statements. If `mjs` is equal to 0, it prints "1". If `mjs` is equal to 1, it prints "2". If `mjs` is equal to 2, it prints "1". If `mjs` is greater than or equal to 3, it prints "0". In this case, the input is 0, so the code will print "1".
