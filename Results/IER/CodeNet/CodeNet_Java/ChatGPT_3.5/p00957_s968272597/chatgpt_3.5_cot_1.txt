<<<Analysis>>>
The variable l is initialized with 5 and variable k is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable dp is initialized as an array of size l+1 with all elements as 0.
Then it calls the dfs() method passing the value of l as an argument. Inside the dfs() method, it checks if the value of d is equal to l. If it is, it recursively calls dfs() method with d-1 and d-k as arguments and returns the sum of the two recursive calls.
If the value of d is less than 0, it returns 0. If the value of d is less than 2, it returns 1. If the value of dp[d] is not equal to 0, it returns the value of dp[d].
Otherwise, it calculates the value of dp[d] by recursively calling dfs() method with d-2 and d-k-1 as arguments and adds 1 to it. It then stores the calculated value in dp[d] and returns it.
Finally, it prints the value returned by dfs(l) as output.
