<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and checks for different conditions to determine the output. 
First, it checks if the input string is "RRR". If it is, it prints "3".
If the input string is "SSR", "SRS", or "RSS", it prints "1".
If the input string starts with "R" and ends with "R" or starts with "R" and ends with "S", it prints "2".
If the input string starts with "R" and ends with "S" or starts with "S" and ends with "R" or starts with "R" and ends with "R" or starts with "S" and ends with "S", it prints "1".
If the input string is "SSS", it prints "0".
In this case, the input string is "RRS". It starts with "R" and ends with "S", so the output would be "1".
