<<<Analysis>>>
The variable first_N is initialized with 3 and variable first_M is initialized with 9 according to the input. The variable MOD is initialized with 1000000007.
It checks if first_N is equal to 1. Since it is not, it goes to the else block.
It checks if (first_M+1)%(first_N-1) is equal to 0. Since it is not, it goes to the else block.
It calculates the value of first_limit as (first_M+1)/(first_N-1).
It checks if first_limit is less than or equal to 0. Since it is not, it goes to the else block.
It creates a BigInteger object bigMOD with the value of MOD.
It creates a BigInteger object limit with the value of first_limit.
It creates a BigInteger object A with the value of (first_M+1).
It creates a BigInteger object B with the value of 2*(first_M+1) and multiplies it with limit.
It creates a BigInteger object C with the value of (first_N-1) and multiplies it with limit and (first_limit+1).
It adds B to A and subtracts C from it.
It calculates the remainder of A divided by bigMOD.
It prints the remainder as output.
