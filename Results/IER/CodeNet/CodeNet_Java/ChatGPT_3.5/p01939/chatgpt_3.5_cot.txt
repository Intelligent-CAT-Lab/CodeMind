<<<Analysis>>>
The variable first_N and variable first_M are initialized with 3 and 9 respectively according to the input. And variable first_limit is initialized with 0.
It checks if first_N is equal to 1. Since it is not, it goes to the else block.
It checks if (first_M+1)%(first_N-1) is equal to 0. Since it is not, it goes to the else block.
It calculates first_limit as (first_M+1)/(first_N-1).
It checks if first_limit is less than or equal to 0. Since it is not, it goes to the else block.
It initializes a BigInteger object bigMOD with the value of MOD.
It initializes a BigInteger object limit with the value of first_limit.
It initializes a BigInteger object A with the value of (first_M+1).
It initializes a BigInteger object B with the value of 2*(first_M+1) and multiplies it with limit.
It initializes a BigInteger object C with the value of (first_N-1) and multiplies it with limit and (first_limit+1).
It adds B to A and subtracts C from it.
It calculates the remainder of A divided by bigMOD.
It prints the remainder as output.
