<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: R1, C1, R2, and C2. These values are assigned to the corresponding variables.
Then, the code calls the `solve()` method and prints its return value.

In the `solve()` method, an array `factorial` is initialized with a size of `R2+C2+11`. The first two elements of the array are set to 1, and the rest of the elements are calculated using a for loop. The `mul()` method is used to calculate the product of two numbers, and the `sub()` method is used to subtract one number from another.

The `solve()` method then calls the `f()` method four times with different arguments. The `f()` method calculates a value based on the given arguments and the `factorial` array. The calculated values are stored in variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

Finally, the `solve()` method returns the result of subtracting `b`, `c`, and `d` from `a`, and this value is printed as the output.
