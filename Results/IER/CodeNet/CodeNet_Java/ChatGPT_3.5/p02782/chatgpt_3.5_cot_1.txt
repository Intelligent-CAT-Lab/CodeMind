<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four integers R1, C1, R2, C2 from the input. Then it calls the solve() method and prints its return value.

Inside the solve() method, it initializes an array called factorial with size R2+C2+11 and calculates the factorial values for each index using a for loop. Then it calculates four values a, b, c, and d using the f() method and the factorial array. Finally, it returns the result of subtracting b, c, and d from a and prints the result.

The f() method calculates the value of k(r+1, c+1) - 1 using the factorial array. It first calculates the factorial of r+c+2 and then divides it by the factorial of r+1 and the factorial of c+1. Finally, it subtracts 1 from the result and returns it.

The solve() method also uses several helper methods such as pow(), sub(), div(), and add() to perform arithmetic operations with modular arithmetic.
