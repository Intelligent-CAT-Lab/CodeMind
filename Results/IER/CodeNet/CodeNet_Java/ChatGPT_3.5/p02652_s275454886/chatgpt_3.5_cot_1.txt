<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes variables `sum` and `start` to 0. It then iterates through the character array and updates the `sum` variable based on the values of the characters. It also updates the `start` variable to the minimum value of `start` and `sum`. 

After that, it calls the `solve` method twice, passing the original character array and `start` and `start - 1` as arguments. The `solve` method calculates the maximum prefix sum and returns the difference between the maximum prefix sum and the minimum prefix sum.

Finally, it prints the minimum value between the results of the two `solve` method calls.

In this case, the character array is `0??`?. The `sum` variable is initially 0 and the `start` variable is also 0. The first iteration of the loop sets `sum` to -1 and `start` to -1. The second iteration sets `sum` to -1 and `start` remains -1. The third iteration sets `sum` to 0 and `start` remains -1. The fourth iteration sets `sum` to 1 and `start` remains -1. The fifth iteration sets `sum` to 0 and `start` remains -1.

The `solve` method is then called twice. The first call with `start` as -1 calculates the maximum prefix sum as 1 and returns 2. The second call with `start - 1` as -2 calculates the maximum prefix sum as 1 and returns 3.

Finally, the minimum value between 2 and 3 is printed, which is 2.
