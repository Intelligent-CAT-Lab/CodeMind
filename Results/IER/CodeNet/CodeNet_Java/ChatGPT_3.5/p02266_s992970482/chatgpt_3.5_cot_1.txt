<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and initializes a stack called "down" and a deque called "s". It also initializes a variable "sum" to 0.
Then it iterates through each character in the input string. If the character is "\", it pushes the index of that character into the stack "down".
If the character is "/", it checks if the stack "down" is empty. If it is not empty, it pops the top index from the stack and calculates the difference between the current index and the popped index. 
If the deque "s" is empty, it adds a new Pool object to the deque with the popped index and the calculated difference as its parameters.
If the deque "s" is not empty, it calculates the sum of the differences of all the previous Pools in the deque whose indices are greater than the popped index. It then adds a new Pool object to the deque with the popped index and the sum as its parameters.
Finally, it adds the calculated difference to the variable "sum".
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of the variable "sum" as the first output.
Then it creates a StringBuilder object and appends the size of the deque "s" to it. It then iterates through each Pool object in the deque "s" and appends its difference value to the StringBuilder.
Finally, it prints the StringBuilder as the second output.
