<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 3 according to the input. 
Then it calls the solve() method passing the value of a and an empty list l as arguments.
Inside the solve() method, it checks if a is even or odd.
If a is even, it enters a nested for loop and iterates from 1 to a/2. For each iteration, it adds four pairs of numbers to the list l: (i, j), (i, a+1-j), (a+1-i, j), (a+1-i, a+1-j).
If a is odd, it recursively calls the solve() method with a-1 as the argument and the same list l. Then it adds a pairs of numbers to the list l: (a, i) for each i from 1 to a-1.
Finally, it prints the size of the list l and then each element of the list l.
