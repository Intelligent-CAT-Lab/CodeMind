<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string S from the input. It initializes an array num of size 26 to store the count of each character in the string. It also initializes a variable ans with the value of (S.length())*(S.length()+1)/2+1.

Then, it iterates through each character in the string S. For each character, it calculates the index c by subtracting the character 'a' from the current character. It increments the count of character c in the num array and subtracts the count from the ans variable.

Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.

In this case, the input string is "aatt". The length of the string is 4. The ans variable is initialized with the value of (4)*(4+1)/2+1 = 11.

For the first character 'a', the index c is 0. The count of character 'a' in the num array is incremented to 1 and subtracted from the ans variable, resulting in ans = 11 - 1 = 10.

For the second character 'a', the index c is 0. The count of character 'a' in the num array is incremented to 2 and subtracted from the ans variable, resulting in ans = 10 - 2 = 8.

For the third character 't', the index c is 19. The count of character 't' in the num array is incremented to 1 and subtracted from the ans variable, resulting in ans = 8 - 1 = 7.

For the fourth character 't', the index c is 19. The count of character 't' in the num array is incremented to 2 and subtracted from the ans variable, resulting in ans = 7 - 2 = 5.

Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 5.
