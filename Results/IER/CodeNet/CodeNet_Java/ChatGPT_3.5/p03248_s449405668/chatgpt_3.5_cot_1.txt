<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and checks if the first character is '0' or the second last character is '0' or the last character is '1'. If any of these conditions are true, it prints -1 and returns.
If none of the above conditions are true, it continues to check if the string is a palindrome. It compares the characters at the beginning and end of the string, moving towards the center. If any pair of characters are not equal, it prints -1 and returns.
If the string is a palindrome, it enters a loop and prints the parent-child relationship between the characters. The parent is initially set to 0. For each character except the last one, it prints the parent+1 and the current index+2. If the current character is '1', it updates the parent to the current index+1.
