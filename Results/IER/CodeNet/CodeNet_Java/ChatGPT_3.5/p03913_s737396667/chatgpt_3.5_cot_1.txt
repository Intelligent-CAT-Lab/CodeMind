<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and a, and initializes the variables with the given values. It then creates an instance of the Solver class and calls the solve() method on it. 

Inside the solve() method, it initializes the answer variable with the value of n. It then iterates from eatCount = 1 to 40. For each eatCount, it calls the calculateCookieTime() method passing the eatCount as an argument. The calculateCookieTime() method calculates the time taken to eat all the cookies based on the eatCount and the value of n. It then updates the answer variable with the minimum time calculated so far.

Finally, the solve() method returns the final value of the answer variable.

The execute() method in the Main class takes the input values, creates an instance of ContestReader and PrintWriter, and calls the execute() method passing the reader and writer objects.

The execute() method reads the input values using the reader object and passes them to the Solver class. It then prints the output using the writer object.
