<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: h, w, s, and t. These inputs are assigned to the variables h, w, s, and t respectively.
Then it checks if the product of h and w is odd and if the sum of s*w and t is odd. If both conditions are true, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, the product of 4 and 5 is 20, which is even. The sum of 2*5 and 3 is 13, which is odd. Therefore, the condition is true and the output will be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
