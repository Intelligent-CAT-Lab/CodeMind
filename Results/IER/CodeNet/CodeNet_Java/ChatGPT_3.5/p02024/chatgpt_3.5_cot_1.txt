<<<Analysis>>>
The variables h, w, s, and t are initialized with the values 4, 5, 2, and 3 respectively according to the input.
The code checks if the product of h and w is odd and if the sum of s times w and t is odd. If both conditions are true, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, the product of h and w is 20 which is even, and the sum of s times w and t is 13 which is odd. Therefore, the condition is not met and the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
