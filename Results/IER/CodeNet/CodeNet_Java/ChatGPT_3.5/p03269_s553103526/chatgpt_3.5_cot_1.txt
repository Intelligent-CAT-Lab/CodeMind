<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `l` and performs a series of calculations to generate a graph with 20 nodes and a certain number of edges. The number of edges is determined by the value of `l`. The graph is then printed as output.
The code initializes an array of lists called `edges` with size 21. Each index of the array represents a node in the graph. The code then iterates from 1 to 19 and adds an edge from each node to the next node with a cost of 0. This creates a linear chain of nodes in the graph.
Next, the code initializes an array called `ika` with size 21. The value at each index `i` is calculated as `(1<<(20-i))-1`. This creates a binary number with `20-i` trailing 1s. This array is used in the following steps to determine the maximum value of `l` that can be reached from each node.
The code then iterates from 19 to 1. For each index `i`, it checks if `(1<<(19-i)) + ika[i+1] < l`. If this condition is true, it adds an edge from the current node to the next node with a cost of `(1<<(19-i))`. This creates a branching structure in the graph.
If the condition is false, it enters an inner loop and iterates from `v+1` to 20, where `v` is the current index `i`. It checks if `max+1 + ika[j] < l` for each index `j`. If this condition is true, it adds an edge from the current node to the next node with a cost of `max+1`. The value of `max` is updated to `max+1+ika[j]` after each edge is added. This creates additional branches in the graph.
After the loops finish, the code calculates the total number of edges in the graph by summing the sizes of all the lists in the `edges` array. It then prints the number of nodes (20) and the number of edges as output. Finally, it prints each edge in the graph as three integers: the starting node, the ending node, and the cost.
