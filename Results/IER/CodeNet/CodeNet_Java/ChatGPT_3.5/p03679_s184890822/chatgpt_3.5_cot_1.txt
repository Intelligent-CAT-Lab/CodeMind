<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 3 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if A is greater than or equal to B. If it is, it prints "delicious".
If A is not greater than or equal to B, it checks if X + A is less than B. If it is, it prints "dangerous".
If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints "safe".
In this case, X + A is 7 which is not less than B, so the output would be "safe".
<<<Output>>>
