<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 24 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0, q is initialized with 2 and div is initialized with 0.
It checks if N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 0 and returns.
It enters a for loop with e starting from 1 and running indefinitely.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of div as q raised to the power of e.
It checks if N is divisible by div. If it is, it divides N by div and increments ans by 1.
If N is not divisible by div, it enters a while loop and divides N by q repeatedly until N is no longer divisible by q.
Then it increments q by 1.
If q multiplied by q is greater than N, it breaks out of the loop.
If N is not equal to 1, it increments ans by 1.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 3.
