<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the user and splits it into two strings using the space as a delimiter. The first string is then parsed into an integer variable A, and the second string is parsed into an integer variable P. The code then calculates the expression (P+3*A)/2 and prints the result as the output.
In this case, the input is "1 3", so A will be assigned the value 1 and P will be assigned the value 3. The expression (P+3*A)/2 evaluates to (3+3*1)/2 = 6/2 = 3. Therefore, the output will be 3.
