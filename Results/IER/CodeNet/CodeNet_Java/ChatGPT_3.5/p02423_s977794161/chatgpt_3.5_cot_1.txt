<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input. Then it converts the decimal number n to binary representation using the Long.toBinaryString() method and stores it in the variable nishin. 
Then it converts the string nishin to a character array c. 
It initializes the variable start with the value 32 minus the length of nishin. 
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 31. 
Inside the loop, it checks if the current index i is less than start. If it is, it prints 0. 
Otherwise, it checks if the character at index i - start in the array c is equal to '1'. If it is, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 0. 
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line. 
Then it enters another for loop that is similar to the previous one, but with a different condition for printing 1s and 0s. 
After this loop finishes, it prints a new line. 
Then it enters another for loop that is similar to the first one, but with a different condition for printing 1s and 0s. 
After this loop finishes, it prints a 0. 
Then it prints a new line. 
Then it prints a 0. 
Then it enters another for loop that is similar to the first one, but with a different condition for printing 1s and 0s. 
After this loop finishes, it prints a new line. 
Finally, it closes the Scanner object stdIn.
