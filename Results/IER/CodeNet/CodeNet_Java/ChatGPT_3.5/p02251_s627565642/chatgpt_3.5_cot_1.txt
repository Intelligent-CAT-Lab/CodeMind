<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 100 according to the input. And variable result is initialized with 0.
It calculates the number of quarters (25 cents) that can be obtained from n by dividing n by 25 and adds it to result. Then it updates the value of n by taking the remainder of n divided by 25.
Next, it calculates the number of dimes (10 cents) that can be obtained from the updated value of n by dividing n by 10 and adds it to result. Then it updates the value of n by taking the remainder of n divided by 10.
Then, it calculates the number of nickels (5 cents) that can be obtained from the updated value of n by dividing n by 5 and adds it to result. Then it updates the value of n by taking the remainder of n divided by 5.
Finally, it adds the remaining value of n to result and prints the final value of result as output.
In this case, the value of result would be 4 (4 quarters) and the output would be 4.
