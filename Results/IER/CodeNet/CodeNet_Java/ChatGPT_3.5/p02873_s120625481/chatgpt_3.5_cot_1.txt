<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and stores it in an array of characters called S. It then initializes variables ans, c, up, and down to 0. 
The code then enters a for loop that iterates through each character in the input string. 
If the current character is '<', it checks if it is the same as the previous character. If it is, it increments the variable up. 
If it is not the same, it calculates the number of valid substrings that can be formed using the previous sequence of '<' and '>' characters. 
It adds this value to ans and resets the variables up and down. 
If the current character is '>', it increments the variable down. 
After the loop finishes, it calculates the number of valid substrings for the last sequence of '<' and '>' characters and adds it to ans. 
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
