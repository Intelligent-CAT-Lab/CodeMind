<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and checks if the first two characters are the same. If they are, it prints "Yes" and returns. If not, it checks if the first three characters are the same. If they are, it prints "Yes" and returns. If neither condition is met, it prints "No".
In this case, the input string is "1118". The first two characters are the same (1), so it prints "Yes" and returns.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
