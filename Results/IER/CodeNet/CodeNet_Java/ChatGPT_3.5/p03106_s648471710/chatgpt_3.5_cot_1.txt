<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and k are initialized with 8, 12, and 2 respectively according to the input. The variable smaller is initialized with the minimum value between a and b, which is 8. An array called divisors is created with a size of smaller+1 (9 in this case) and all elements are initialized with 0.

Then, a for loop is used to iterate from 1 to smaller (8 in this case). Inside the loop, it checks if both a and b are divisible by i. If they are, it adds i to the corresponding element in the divisors array.

After the loop, the divisors array is sorted in reverse order using the Arrays.sort() method with the Collections.reverseOrder() comparator. Finally, it prints the k-th element in the sorted divisors array, which is 6.

<<<Output>>>
6
