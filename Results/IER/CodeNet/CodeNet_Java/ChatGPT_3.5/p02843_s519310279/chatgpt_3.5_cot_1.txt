<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable num.
It then calculates the number of stack items by dividing num by 100 and stores it in the variable stack_item.
Next, it calculates the difference between num and stack_item * 100 and stores it in the variable diff.
It initializes a boolean variable pos as false.
If the value of diff is less than or equal to stack_item * 5, it sets pos to true.
Finally, it checks the value of pos and prints "1" if it is true, and "0" if it is false.

In this case, the input is 615.
The value of stack_item would be 6 (615 / 100 = 6).
The value of diff would be 15 (615 - 6 * 100 = 15).
Since 15 is less than or equal to 6 * 5 (30), pos is set to true.
Therefore, the output would be "1".
