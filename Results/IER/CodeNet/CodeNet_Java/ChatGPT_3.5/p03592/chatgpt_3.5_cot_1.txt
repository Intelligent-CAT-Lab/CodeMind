<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, M and K are initialized with 2, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 for both i and j.
Inside the nested for loop, it calculates the value of sum using the formula M * i + N * j - (i * j * 2).
Then it checks if the calculated value of sum is equal to K. If it is, it prints "Yes" and returns from the main method.
After the loop finishes, it prints "No" as output because no match was found.
<<<Output>>>
No
