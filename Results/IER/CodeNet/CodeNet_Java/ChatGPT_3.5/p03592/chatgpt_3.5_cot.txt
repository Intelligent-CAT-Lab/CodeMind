<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, M, and K are initialized with the values 2, 2, and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a nested for loop where the outer loop iterates from 0 to N and the inner loop iterates from 0 to M.
Inside the nested loop, it calculates the value of the variable sum using the formula M * i + N * j - (i * j * 2).
If the calculated sum is equal to K, it prints "Yes" and returns from the main method.
If the loop finishes without finding a match, it prints "No".
In this case, the calculated sum is 0, which is not equal to K.
<<<Output>>>
No
