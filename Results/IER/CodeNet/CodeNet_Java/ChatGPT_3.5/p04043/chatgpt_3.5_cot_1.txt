<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c respectively.
Then it checks the following conditions:
- If a is equal to 5 and b is equal to 7 and c is equal to 5, it prints "YES".
- If a is equal to 5 and b is equal to 5 and c is equal to 7, it prints "YES".
- If a is equal to 7 and b is equal to 5 and c is equal to 5, it prints "YES".
- If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NO".
In this case, the condition a == 5 && b == 5 && c == 7 is met, so the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
