<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c respectively.
Then it checks the values of a, b, and c in a series of if-else statements.
If a is 5, b is 7, and c is 5, it prints "YES".
If a is 5, b is 5, and c is 7, it prints "YES".
If a is 7, b is 5, and c is 5, it prints "YES".
Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, a is 5, b is 5, and c is 7, so the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
