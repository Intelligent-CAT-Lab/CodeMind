<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input. It then checks for different conditions based on the values of n and m.

If n and m are both 1, it prints 1.
If n is 1 and m is not 1, it prints m-2.
If m is 1 and n is not 1, it prints n-2.
Otherwise, it prints (m-2)*(n-2).

In this case, n=2 and m=2. Since n and m are both 1, the first condition is not met. The second and third conditions are also not met. Therefore, it goes to the else block and calculates (2-2)*(2-2) which is 0.

<<<Output>>>
0
