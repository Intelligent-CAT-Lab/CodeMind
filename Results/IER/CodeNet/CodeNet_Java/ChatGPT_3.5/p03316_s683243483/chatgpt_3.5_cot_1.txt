<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input. 
It reads the value of n using the Scanner class.
Then it converts the integer n to a string strn using the valueOf() method of the String class.
It calculates the length of the string strn and stores it in the variable len.
It initializes the variable ans as an empty string and the variable sum as 0.
It enters a for loop and iterates from 0 to len-1 to check each character in the string strn.
Inside the loop, it extracts each character from the string strn using the substring() method and converts it to an integer using the parseInt() method.
It adds the converted integer to the variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the remainder of n divided by sum is 0.
If the condition is true, it assigns the value "Yes" to the variable ans.
Otherwise, it assigns the value "No" to the variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of the variable ans as the output, which is "Yes" in this case.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
