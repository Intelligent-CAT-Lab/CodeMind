<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and k from the input. It then initializes arrays a, b, and f with size k+1 and array dp with size n+1. It also initializes a Long variable res with 0. 

Then it enters a for loop from 1 to k and reads two integers a[i] and b[i] from the input. It sets f[a[i]] and f[b[i]] to 1. 

Next, it enters a for loop from 1 to n and calculates the prefix sum of array f. 

Then it enters a nested for loop from x=1 to n and y=x to n. Inside the nested loop, it calculates the number of integers not paired outside the range [x, y] and stores it in the variable notPairedOutSideXY. It then calculates the number of ways to pair the integers not paired inside the range [x, y] and stores it in the variable waysToPair. It multiplies waysToPair with notPairedOutSideXY and adds it to the variable res. 

Finally, it prints the value of res as the output.
