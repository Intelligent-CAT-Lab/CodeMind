<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and k from the input. It then initializes arrays a, b, and f with size k+1 and array dp with size n+1. It also initializes a Long array memoWaysToPair with size n+1. It then fills the arrays a and b with k integers each from the input. It also fills array f with 1 at the indices specified by the values in arrays a and b. It then calculates the cumulative sum of array f and stores it in the same array. It then initializes all elements of array dp and memoWaysToPair with -1. It then enters a nested for loop where it iterates over all possible pairs of indices x and y such that x is less than or equal to y. Inside the nested loop, it calculates the number of integers that are not paired within the range (x, y) and stores it in the variable notPairedOutSideXY. It then calculates the number of integers that are not paired within the range (x, y) and stores it in the variable notPairedOutSideXY. It then calculates the number of ways to pair the notPairedOutSideXY integers and stores it in the variable waysToPair. It then calculates the number of integers that are not paired within the range (z+1, y) and stores it in the variable notPairedinZY. It then calculates the number of ways to pair the notPairedinZY integers and stores it in the variable waysToPair. It then subtracts the product of caldp(x, z) and waysToPair from dp[x][y] and stores the result in dp[x][y]. Finally, it prints the value of res as the output.
