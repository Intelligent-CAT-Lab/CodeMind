<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable x and variable y are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input. 
An array ans of size n is initialized to store the answer.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it initializes an array dist of size n and fills it with -1. It also initializes a queue and adds the current integer i to the queue. It sets the distance of i from itself to 0 in the dist array.
Then it enters a while loop which continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration of the while loop, it removes the first element from the queue and assigns it to variable p.
It checks if p-1 is a valid index and if the distance of p-1 is -1. If both conditions are true, it sets the distance of p-1 from i to dist[p] + 1 and adds p-1 to the queue.
It checks if p+1 is a valid index and if the distance of p+1 is -1. If both conditions are true, it sets the distance of p+1 from i to dist[p] + 1 and adds p+1 to the queue.
It checks if p is equal to x and if the distance of y is -1. If both conditions are true, it sets the distance of y from i to dist[p] + 1 and adds y to the queue.
It checks if p is equal to y and if the distance of x is -1. If both conditions are true, it sets the distance of x from i to dist[p] + 1 and adds x to the queue.
After the while loop finishes, it enters another for loop which iterates from i to n-1. In each iteration, it increments the count of the distance in the ans array.
Finally, it enters another for loop which iterates from 1 to n-1. In each iteration, it prints the count of the distance from i in the ans array.
