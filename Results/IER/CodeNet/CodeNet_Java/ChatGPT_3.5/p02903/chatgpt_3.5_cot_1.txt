<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h, variable w, variable a and variable b are initialized with 3, 3, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable s1 and variable s2 are initialized with empty strings.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. If j is less than a, it appends "0" to s1 and "1" to s2. Otherwise, it appends "1" to s1 and "0" to s2. After the loop finishes, s1 will be "010" and s2 will be "101".
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. If i is less than b, it prints s1. Otherwise, it prints s2. After printing each line, it prints a new line character.
So the output will be:
010
101
101
<<<Output>>>
010
101
101
