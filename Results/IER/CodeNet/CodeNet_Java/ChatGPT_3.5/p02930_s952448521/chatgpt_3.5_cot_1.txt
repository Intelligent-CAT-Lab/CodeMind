<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the first for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i+1 to 3 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer k in this range.
Inside the third for loop, it checks if the kth bit of i is different from the kth bit of j. If it is different, it prints the value of k+1 and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final output.
