<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and checks if any two adjacent characters in the string are the same. It does this by iterating through the string and comparing each character with the next character. If it finds any two adjacent characters that are the same, it sets the flag variable to false. After the loop finishes, it checks the value of the flag variable. If it is true, it prints "Good", otherwise it prints "Bad".

In this case, the input string is "3776". The code will iterate through the string and compare each character with the next character. It will find that the first and second characters are different, the second and third characters are different, and the third and fourth characters are the same. Therefore, the flag variable will be set to false. Finally, it will print "Bad" as the output.

<<<Output>>>
Bad
