<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: n, a, and b.
It initializes two long variables aa and bb with the value 1.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates a times. In each iteration, it calculates aa by multiplying aa with (n-i) and then dividing it by (i+1). The result is then taken modulo MOD.
After that, it enters another for loop that iterates b times. In each iteration, it calculates bb in the same way as aa.
Next, it calculates the value of (power(2, n)-aa-bb-1+MOD*3)%MOD and prints it as the output.
The power function is a recursive function that calculates the power of a number using the modulo operation.
The div function calculates the division of two numbers using the power function and the modulo operation.
