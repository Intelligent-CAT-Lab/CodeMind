<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string S from the input. Then it calls the solver method passing the string S as an argument.
Inside the solver method, it initializes the variable k with the length of string S and the variable sum with 0.
Then it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to k-1 and the inner loop iterates from 0 to k-i-1.
Inside the inner loop, it calculates the power of 2 based on the value of d and k. If d is equal to k-i-1, it calculates 2^(k-d-1), otherwise it calculates 2^(k-d-2).
Then it calculates the value of add by multiplying the power of 10 with d and p.
Finally, it adds the product of add and the integer value of the character at index i in string S to the variable sum.
After the loops finish, it prints the final value of sum as the output.
