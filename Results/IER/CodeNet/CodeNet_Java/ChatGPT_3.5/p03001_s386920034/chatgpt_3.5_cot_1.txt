<<<Analysis>>>
The variable w, h, x, and y are initialized with 2, 3, 1, and 2 respectively according to the input.
Then it calculates the product of w, h, and 0.5 and assigns it to a double variable.
Next, it checks if 2 * x is equal to w and 2 * y is equal to h. If both conditions are true, it assigns 1 to the result variable, otherwise it assigns 0.
Finally, it prints the value of the product and the result variable as output.
<<<Output>>>
