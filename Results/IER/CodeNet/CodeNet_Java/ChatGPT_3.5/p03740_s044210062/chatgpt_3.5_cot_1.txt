<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers x and y from the input. It then checks if the absolute difference between x and y is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints "Alice", otherwise it prints "Brown".
In this case, x=2 and y=1. The absolute difference between x and y is 1, which is not greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the code will print "Brown".
<<<Output>>>
Brown
