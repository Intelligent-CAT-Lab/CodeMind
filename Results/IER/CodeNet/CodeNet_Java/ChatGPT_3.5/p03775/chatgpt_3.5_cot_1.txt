<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the value 10000 according to the input.
It calculates the square root of N and assigns it to the variable sqrt.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from sqrt to 1.
Inside the loop, it checks if N is divisible by the current value of i. If it is, it calculates the length of i and the length of N/i and assigns them to variables A and B respectively.
Then it prints the maximum value between A and B as output and returns.
In this case, the loop will only run once because the square root of 10000 is 100, and 100 is the only value that divides 10000 evenly.
The length of 100 is 3, so the output will be 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
