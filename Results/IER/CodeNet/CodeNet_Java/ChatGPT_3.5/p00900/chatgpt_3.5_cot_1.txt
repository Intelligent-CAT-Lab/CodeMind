<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input values for variables h and w, which are initialized with 5 and 6 respectively.
Then it creates a 2D array called map with size h x w and a 2D boolean array called bomb with size h x w.
It also creates an ArrayList called ps to store the coordinates of the cells with numbers.
Then it reads the input values for the map array and populates the map array and the ps ArrayList accordingly.
It initializes the variables size, memo and pow10.
Then it calculates the value of variable S by multiplying the map values with the corresponding pow10 values and adding them together.
Finally, it calls the solve method with the initial values of S and 0 as arguments and prints the result.
The solve method is a recursive method that takes the current state S and the current count cnt as arguments.
It checks if the current state S is already in the memo HashMap and returns the corresponding value if it is.
If the current state S is a winning state, it returns 0 if the remaining number of bombs is 0, otherwise it returns a large value (INF).
If the current count cnt is equal to 9, it checks if the current cell is empty (0) and calls the solve method with the next state S+1 and 0 as arguments.
Otherwise, it returns a large value (INF).
If none of the above conditions are met, it initializes the minimum value min with the result of calling the solve method with the next count cnt+1 as argument.
Then it calculates the coordinates of the next cell by adding the current cell coordinates with the corresponding dx and dy values.
If the next cell is out of bounds or already bombed or empty, it returns the minimum value min.
Otherwise, it updates the next state S by subtracting the corresponding pow10 value if the next cell is already bombed, and sets the flag ng to true.
Then it checks if the flag ng is false and updates the minimum value min with the result of calling the solve method with the updated next state and the next count cnt+1 as arguments.
Finally, it returns the minimum value min.
