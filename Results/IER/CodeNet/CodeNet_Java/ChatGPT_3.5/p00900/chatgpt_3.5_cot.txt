<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers h and w from the input, which are 5 and 6 respectively. Then it initializes a 2D array map with size h x w and a 2D array bomb with size h x w. It also initializes an ArrayList ps to store the coordinates of the cells with numbers in the map. Then it reads h lines from the input and for each line, it reads w characters. If the character is '.', it sets the corresponding element in map to -1. If the character is '*', it sets the corresponding element in map to 0 and sets the corresponding element in bomb to true. If the character is a digit, it converts the character to an integer and sets the corresponding element in map to that integer. It also adds a new P object with the coordinates of the current cell to the ArrayList ps. After reading the input, it converts the ArrayList ps to an array of P objects. Then it initializes a HashMap memo to store the results of subproblems and an array pow10 to store powers of 10. It calculates the initial value of S by multiplying the first element in ps with 100 and adding it to the product of the remaining elements in ps and the corresponding elements in map. Then it calls the solve method with the initial value of S and 0 as arguments and prints the return value of the solve method.
The solve method takes two arguments: S and cnt. It first checks if the value of S is already in the memo HashMap. If it is, it returns the corresponding value. If the last two digits of S are equal to size, it checks if the first digit of S is 0. If it is, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns INF. If cnt is equal to 9, it checks if the digit at position p in S is 0. If it is, it calls the solve method with S+1 and 0 as arguments and returns the return value. Otherwise, it returns INF. If none of the above conditions are met, it initializes min with the return value of the solve method called with S and cnt+1 as arguments. It calculates the coordinates of the next cell by adding dx[cnt] to the x-coordinate and dy[cnt] to the y-coordinate of the current cell. If the next cell is out of bounds or it is already bombed or it is an empty cell, it returns min. Otherwise, it sets the variable next to the value of S. It sets the corresponding element in bomb to true. It initializes a boolean variable ng to false. Then it iterates over all the cells in ps and for each cell, it iterates over all the possible directions. If the cell at the current direction is out of bounds or it is not equal to the target cell, it continues to the next iteration. If the digit at the current cell in next is greater than 0, it subtracts pow10[i] from next. Otherwise, it sets ng to true. If ng is false, it updates min to the minimum of min and the return value of the solve method called with next and cnt+1 as arguments plus 1. Finally, it sets the corresponding element in bomb to false and returns min.
