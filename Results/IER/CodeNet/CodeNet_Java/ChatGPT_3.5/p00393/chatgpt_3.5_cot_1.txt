<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 4 and 3 respectively according to the input. The variable mod is initialized with 1000000007. The 2D array dp is initialized with size [100010][2].
It sets dp[0][0] to 1.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4. In each iteration, it updates the values of dp[i][0] and dp[i][1] based on the previous values of dp[i-1][0] and dp[i-1][1]. It also checks if i-m >= 0, and if it is true, it updates the value of dp[i][1] by subtracting dp[i-m][0] from it.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of pow2(n) by multiplying 2 to the power of n and taking modulo mod.
Finally, it prints the value of (pow2(n) - (dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) + mod * mod) % mod as output.
