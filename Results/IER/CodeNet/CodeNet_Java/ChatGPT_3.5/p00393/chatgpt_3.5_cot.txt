The variable n and variable m are initialized with 4 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The 2D array dp is initialized with size [100010][2].
The value of dp[0][0] is set to 1.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4.
Inside the loop, it updates the values of dp[i][0] and dp[i][1] based on the previous values of dp[i-1][0] and dp[i-1][1].
Then it checks if i-m is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it subtracts the value of dp[i-m][0] from dp[i][1].
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of pow2(n) using the pow2() method.
Finally, it calculates the final output by subtracting the sum of dp[n][0] and dp[n][1] from pow2(n), and then taking the modulo mod.
