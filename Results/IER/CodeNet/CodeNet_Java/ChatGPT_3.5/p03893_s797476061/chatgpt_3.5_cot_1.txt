<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with the value 2 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with the value 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from X to 1. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of ans by 2 and adds 2 to it.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output.
In this case, the loop will only run once because X is 2. So, the value of ans will be 2 * 2 + 2 = 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
