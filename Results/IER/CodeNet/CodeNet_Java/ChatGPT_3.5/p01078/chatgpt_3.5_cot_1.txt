<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 and variable K is initialized with 2 according to the input.
Then it creates four Point objects a, b, pa and pb with their respective coordinates.
It calculates the intersection point of line a-pa and line b-pb using the lineIntersection method.
Then it calculates the vectors ai and bi by subtracting the intersection point from a and b respectively.
It calculates the area of the triangle formed by ai and bi using the det method of Point class.
Then it calculates the area of the convex polygon formed by a and b using the det method of Point class and multiplies it by N.
Finally, it subtracts the area of the triangle from the area of the convex polygon and prints the result.
