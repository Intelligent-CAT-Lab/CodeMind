<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers N and K from the input. It then initializes two Point objects a and b with specific values. It also calculates two more Point objects pa and pb based on the values of N and K. It then calculates the intersection point of the lines formed by a-pa and b-pb using the lineIntersection method. It then calculates the vectors ai and bi by subtracting the intersection point from a and b respectively. It calculates the area of the triangle formed by ai and bi using the det method of the Point class. It then calculates the area of the convex polygon formed by a and b using the det method and multiplies it by N. Finally, it subtracts the area of the triangle from the area of the convex polygon and prints the result.
