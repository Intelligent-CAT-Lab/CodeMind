<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with 0 according to the input. And variable A is calculated as K/50, which is 0, and variable B is calculated as K%50, which is also 0.
Then an array a of size 50 is created and each element of the array is initialized with i + A, where i ranges from 0 to 49. Since A is 0, each element of the array is just equal to i.
Then a for loop is used to increment the last B elements of the array by 1. Since B is 0, this loop does nothing.
Finally, it prints the value 50 and then prints each element of the array a separated by a space.
