<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and checks its length. If the length of the string is even and the first character is different from the last character, it prints "Second". Otherwise, it prints "First".
In this case, the input string is "aba". The length of the string is 3, which is odd. Therefore, the code will print "First".
<<<Output>>>
First
