<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and checks its length. If the length of the string is even and the first character is the same as the last character, it prints "Second". Otherwise, it prints "First".
In this case, the input string is "aba", which has a length of 3 and the first and last characters are the same. Therefore, the output will be "Second".
<<<Output>>>
Second
