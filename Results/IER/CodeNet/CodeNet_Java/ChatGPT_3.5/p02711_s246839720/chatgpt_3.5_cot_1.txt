<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and checks if any of the characters in the string is equal to "7". If there is a "7" in the string, it sets the flag variable "flg" to true. After checking all the characters, it prints "Yes" if the flag is true, otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input string is "117". The code checks each character in the string and finds that the second character is "7". Therefore, the flag variable is set to true. Finally, it prints "Yes" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
