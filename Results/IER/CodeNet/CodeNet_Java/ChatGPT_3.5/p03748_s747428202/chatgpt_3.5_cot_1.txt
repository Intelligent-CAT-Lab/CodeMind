The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is initialized with 3 according to the input.
A 3D array dp is created with dimensions [2][n+1][2].
The initial values of dp are set such that dp[0][i][0] = 1 for i = 1 to n and dp[0][i][1] = 1 for i = 0.
Then, a nested loop is used to iterate through each operation and each position in the array.
Inside the loop, there are four conditions to update the values of dp.
1. If j-1 >= 0, then dp[(i+1)%2][j-1][k] is updated by adding dp[i%2][j][k].
2. If j+1 <= n, then dp[(i+1)%2][j+1][k] is updated by adding dp[i%2][j][k].
3. If j-1 >= 0, then dp[(i+1)%2][j][k] is updated by adding dp[i%2][j][k].
4. If j+1 <= n, then dp[(i+1)%2][j][k] is updated by adding dp[i%2][j][k].
After each iteration of the inner loop, the values of dp are taken modulo MODULO.
Finally, the sum of dp[m%2][i][1] for i = 0 to n is calculated and stored in the variable ans.
The value of ans is printed as the output.
