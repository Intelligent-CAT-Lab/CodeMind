<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0. An ArrayList l is created to store integers.

It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n. In each iteration, it adds the current integer i to the variable sum and adds i to the ArrayList l. The loop continues until the sum is greater than or equal to n.

After the loop finishes, it removes the element (sum - n) from the ArrayList l. Then it prints each element in the ArrayList l using the stream and forEach method.
