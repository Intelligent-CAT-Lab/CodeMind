The variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input. The variable i is initialized with 0.
It reads an integer from the input and assigns it to variable n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n with i being multiplied by 2 in each iteration.
After the loop finishes, it divides the value of i by 2.
Finally, it prints the value of i as output.
In this case, the for loop will iterate 3 times with i being 1, 2, and 4. After the loop, i will be divided by 2, resulting in 2. Therefore, the output will be 2.
<<<Output>>>
