<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: T, R, and Y. It then finds the maximum value among the three integers and assigns it to variable A. Similarly, it finds the minimum value among the three integers and assigns it to variable B. Finally, it calculates the difference between A and B and prints it as the output.

In this case, the input values are T=1, R=6, and Y=3. The maximum value among these is 6, which is assigned to A. The minimum value is 1, which is assigned to B. Therefore, the difference between A and B is 6-1=5.

<<<Output>>>
5
