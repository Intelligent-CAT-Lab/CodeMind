<<<Analysis>>>
The variable W, H and c are initialized with 3, 3 and "B" respectively according to the input. And variable x is initialized with (W - 1) / 2 = (3 - 1) / 2 = 1 and variable y is initialized with (H - 1) / 2 = (3 - 1) / 2 = 1.
It enters a nested for loop to print a pattern of characters based on the values of W, H and c.
The outer loop iterates from 0 to H-1 and the inner loop iterates from 0 to W-1.
Inside the nested loop, it checks several conditions to determine which character to print at each position.
If j is 0 and i is 0 or j is 0 and i is H - 1 or j is W - 1 and i is 0 or j is W - 1 and i is H - 1, it prints "+". This condition is not met for the given input.
If j is not 0 and j is not W - 1 and i is 0 or j is not 0 and j is not W - 1 and i is H - 1, it prints "-". This condition is not met for the given input.
If i is not 0 and i is not H - 1 and j is 0 or i is not 0 and i is not H - 1 and j is W - 1, it prints "|". This condition is not met for the given input.
If j is x and i is y, it prints "B". This condition is met when j is 1 and i is 1.
Otherwise, it prints ".".
After printing each row, it moves to the next line.
So the output will be:
..B
