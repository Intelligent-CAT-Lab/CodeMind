<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: W, H, and c. W and H are the width and height of a rectangle, and c is a character. The code then calculates the coordinates (x, y) of the center of the rectangle. 

The code then enters a nested for loop to iterate through each row and column of the rectangle. It checks the current position (i, j) and prints different characters based on the following conditions:
- If (i, j) is at one of the four corners of the rectangle, it prints "+"
- If (i, j) is on the top or bottom edge of the rectangle (excluding the corners), it prints "-"
- If (i, j) is on the left or right edge of the rectangle (excluding the corners), it prints "|"
- If (i, j) is at the center of the rectangle, it prints the character c
- For all other positions, it prints "."

After printing each row, it moves to the next line.

In this case, the input is "3 3 B". So, the width (W) and height (H) of the rectangle are both 3, and the character (c) is "B". The center coordinates (x, y) are (1, 1).

The code then prints the following pattern:
```
+B+
|B|
+B+
```

<<<Output>>>
+B+
|B|
+B+
