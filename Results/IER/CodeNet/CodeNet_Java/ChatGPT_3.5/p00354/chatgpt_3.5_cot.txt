<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable `sc`. It then uses this input to calculate the index of the desired day in the string "thu:fri:sat:sun:mon:tue:wed". The input is taken modulo 7 to ensure that the index is within the range of the string.

The string is split using the ":" delimiter, resulting in an array of strings ["thu", "fri", "sat", "sun", "mon", "tue", "wed"]. The code then accesses the element at the calculated index in the array and prints it as the output.

In this case, the input is 1. Taking 1 modulo 7 gives a result of 1. So the code will access the element at index 1 in the array, which is "fri". Therefore, the output will be "fri".
