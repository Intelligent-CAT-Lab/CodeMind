<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable k is initialized with 1 according to the input.
Then it initializes a 2D array ncr with size 2010x2010 and fills it with values using a nested for loop.
After that, it initializes the variable ans with 0.
Then it initializes a 3D array dp with size 2x2x(n+1) and sets the value of dp[n%2][0][0] to 1.
It enters a for loop that iterates from n to 1.
Inside the loop, it initializes the variables fr and to with the current value of i modulo 2 and fr XOR 1 respectively.
Then it fills the dp[to][flg] array with 0.
Next, it calculates the variable haveProcessedNumbers by subtracting j from n.
Then it enters a nested for loop that iterates over the variables flg and j.
Inside the nested loop, it checks if the value of dp[fr][flg][j] is 0. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it assigns the value of dp[fr][flg][j] to the variable base.
Then it calculates the variable currentlyInSequence by subtracting j from haveProcessedNumbers.
If currentlyInSequence is equal to k-1, it adds the value of dp[fr][flg][j] to the variable ans.
If flg is equal to 1 and j is greater than or equal to 1, it assigns the value of base to dp[fr][flg][j-1].
If i is equal to 1, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it assigns the value of base to dp[to][1][j] and dp[to][0][j+1].
After the nested loop finishes, it enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to n-k-1.
Inside the loop, it multiplies the value of ans by 2 and takes the modulo of it with MOD.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
