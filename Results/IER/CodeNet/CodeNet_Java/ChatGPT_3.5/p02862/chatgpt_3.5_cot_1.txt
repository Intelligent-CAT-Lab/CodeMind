<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and variable y are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if the expression (2*y-x)%3!=0 or 2*y-x<0 is true. If it is true, it prints 0 and returns.
Then it calculates the value of variable a as (2*y-x)/3.
It checks if the expression (2*x-y)%3!=0 or 2*x-y<0 is true. If it is true, it prints 0 and returns.
Then it calculates the value of variable b as (2*x-y)/3.
It calls the function C(a+b,a,mod,fif) and prints the returned value as output.
The function C calculates the binomial coefficient C(a+b,a) modulo mod using the precalculated factorials and inverse factorials.
