<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers x and y as input. It checks if the expression (2*y-x)%3 is not equal to 0 or if (2*y-x) is less than 0. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 0 and returns. Otherwise, it calculates the value of a as (2*y-x)/3. Then it checks if the expression (2*x-y)%3 is not equal to 0 or if (2*x-y) is less than 0. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 0 and returns. Otherwise, it calculates the value of b as (2*x-y)/3. Finally, it calculates the value of C(a+b, a, mod, fif) and prints it as the output.

The function C(n, r, mod, fif) calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, r) modulo mod using the factorial values stored in the array fif.

The function enumFIF(n, mod) calculates the factorial values and their inverses modulo mod using the enumeration method.
