<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable "line". It then initializes a counter variable "count" to 0 and a boolean variable "a" to true.
The code then iterates through each character in the string "line". If the character is 'A' and "a" is true, it sets "a" to false. If the character is 'Z' and "a" is false, it increments the "count" variable by 1 and sets "a" back to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if "count" is not equal to 0. If it is not 0, it creates a StringBuilder object and appends "AZ" to it "count" number of times. It then prints the resulting string. If "count" is 0, it prints -1.
In this case, the input string is "AIZUNYANPEROPERO". The code will iterate through each character in the string and check if it is 'A' or 'Z'. It will set "a" to false when it encounters the first 'A' and set "a" back to true when it encounters the first 'Z' after 'A'. Since there is only one occurrence of 'A' followed by 'Z', the "count" variable will be 1. The code will then create a StringBuilder object and append "AZ" to it once. The resulting string will be "AZ". Therefore, the output will be "AZ".
