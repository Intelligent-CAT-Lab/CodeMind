<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. The variable dp is initialized as a 3D array with dimensions [2][n+1][2]. The variable mod is initialized as 1000000007.
The value of dp[0][0][1] is set to 1.
Then there is a nested for loop that iterates m times and j from 0 to n and k from 0 to 1.
Inside the nested for loop, there are several if-else conditions that update the values of dp based on the values of j and k.
After the nested for loop finishes, a long variable ans is initialized as 0.
Then there is a for loop that iterates from 0 to n and adds the value of dp[m%2][i][1] to ans.
Finally, the value of ans is printed as the output.
