<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with 1905 according to the input. And variable yy is initialized with the quotient of S divided by 100, which is 19. Variable mm is initialized with the remainder of S divided by 100, which is 5.
It checks if yy falls within the range [1, 12]. Since 19 is not within this range, it goes to the else block.
Inside the else block, it checks if mm falls within the range [1, 12]. Since 5 is within this range, it prints "YYMM" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YYMM
