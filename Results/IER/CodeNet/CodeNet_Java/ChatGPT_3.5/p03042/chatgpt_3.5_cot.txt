<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the value 1905 according to the input. Then, the variable yy is calculated by dividing S by 100, and the variable mm is calculated by taking the remainder of S divided by 100.
Next, there are nested if-else statements to determine the output based on the values of yy and mm.
If yy is between 1 and 12 (inclusive) and mm is also between 1 and 12 (inclusive), then the output is "AMBIGUOUS".
If yy is between 1 and 12 (inclusive) and mm is not between 1 and 12 (inclusive), then the output is "MMYY".
If yy is not between 1 and 12 (inclusive) and mm is between 1 and 12 (inclusive), then the output is "YYMM".
If yy is not between 1 and 12 (inclusive) and mm is not between 1 and 12 (inclusive), then the output is "NA".
In this case, yy is 19 and mm is 5. Since yy is not between 1 and 12, the output is "YYMM".
<<<Output>>>
YYMM
