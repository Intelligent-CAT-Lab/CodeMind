<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable r is initialized with 2919 according to the input.
It checks if the value of n is less than 10. Since n is 2, the condition is true.
Inside the if statement, it calculates the output by adding r to the product of (10 - n) and 100. 
The value of (10 - n) is 8, so the output would be 2919 + (8 * 100) = 3719.
<<<Output>>>
3719
