<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and r. It then checks if n is less than 10. If it is, it calculates the difference between 10 and n, multiplies it by 100, and adds it to r. If n is not less than 10, it simply prints the value of r. In this case, n is 2 which is less than 10, so the code will calculate (10 - 2) * 100 = 800 and add it to r. Therefore, the return value will be 2919 + 800 = 3719.
<<<Output>>>
3719
