<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 2 and variable b is initialized with 2 according to the input.
Then it calculates the minimum and maximum values of the price before tax by dividing the value of a by 0.08 and adding 1 to it respectively. The result is stored in variables tax8pricemin and tax8pricemax.
Then it enters a for loop which iterates from tax8pricemin to tax8pricemax-1.
Inside the loop, it calculates the tax amount for 8% and 10% by multiplying the current price i with 0.08 and 0.1 respectively. The results are stored in variables tax8 and tax10.
Then it checks if the calculated tax amounts tax8 and tax10 are equal to the input values a and b respectively. If they are equal, it prints the current price i and exits the program.
If the loop finishes without finding a match, it prints -1 as output.
<<<Output>>>
-1
