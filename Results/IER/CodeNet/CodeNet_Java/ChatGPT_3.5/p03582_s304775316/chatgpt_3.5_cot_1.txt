The variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 2, 2 and 0 respectively according to the input. And variable n is initialized with the sum of x, y and z, which is 4.
It initializes an empty string variable ans.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it checks if z is greater than or equal to 1 and if it is possible to add 'c' to the current value of ans by calling the isOK method. If the condition is met, it decreases the value of z by 1 and adds 'c' to ans.
If the above condition is not met, it checks if y is greater than or equal to 1 and if it is possible to add 'b' to the current value of ans by calling the isOK method. If the condition is met, it decreases the value of y by 1 and adds 'b' to ans.
If both of the above conditions are not met, it decreases the value of x by 1 and adds 'a' to ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output.
