The variable N is initialized with 105 according to the input. And variable cnt and variable temp are initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 105 with a step of 2 to check each odd integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of divisors of the current odd integer i by checking if i is divisible by each integer j from 1 to i. If i is divisible by j, it increments the value of variable temp by 1.
Then it checks if the value of variable temp is equal to 8. If it is, it increments the value of variable cnt by 1. The condition is met when i has exactly 8 divisors.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable cnt as output.
