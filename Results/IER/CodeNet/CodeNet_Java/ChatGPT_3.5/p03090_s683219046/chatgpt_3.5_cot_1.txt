<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It then calculates the value of n * (n - 1) / 2 - n / 2 and prints it as output.
After that, it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n-1 and the inner loop iterates from 0 to i-1.
Inside the inner loop, it checks if the sum of i and j is equal to (n & ~1) - 1. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it prints the values of j+1 and i+1 as output.
The loop continues until all possible pairs of j and i are printed.
