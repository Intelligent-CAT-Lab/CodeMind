<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers X and Y as input. It then calls the solve() method passing X and Y as arguments. 
Inside the solve() method, it checks if the sum of X and Y is divisible by 3. If it is not divisible by 3, it returns 0.
If it is divisible by 3, it calculates the number of turns required to reach the point (X, Y) starting from (0, 0).
It calculates the number of steps to move in the upper direction (X-axis) and the number of steps to move in the right direction (Y-axis).
Then it calculates the combination of turns and upper steps using the combination() method from the ModInt class.
Finally, it prints the result of the solve() method.
