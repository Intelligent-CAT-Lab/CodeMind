<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input: a, t, and r. The values of a, t, and r are 180, 120, and 90 respectively according to the input.
Then it calculates the expression t / a * r and prints the result as output.
The expression t / a * r is evaluated as (120 / 180) * 90 = 0.6666666666666666 * 90 = 60.0.
So the output of the code execution would be 60.0.
<<<Output>>>
60.0
