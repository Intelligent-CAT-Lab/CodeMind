<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable 's'. It then finds the index of the first occurrence of the character 'A' in the string and assigns it to the variable 'A'. It also finds the index of the last occurrence of the character 'Z' in the string and assigns it to the variable 'Z'. Finally, it calculates the difference between the indices of 'Z' and 'A' and adds 1 to it. This value is then printed as the output.

In the given input string "QWERTYASDFZXCV", the index of 'A' is 6 and the index of the last occurrence of 'Z' is 11. Therefore, the output will be 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.
