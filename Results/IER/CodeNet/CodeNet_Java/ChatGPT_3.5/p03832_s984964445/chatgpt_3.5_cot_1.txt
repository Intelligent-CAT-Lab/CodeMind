<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads 5 integers from the input: n, A, B, C, and D. It then initializes several arrays and variables.
It calculates the binomial coefficients and the factorials using dynamic programming.
Then it calculates the coefficients using the factorials and binomial coefficients.
After that, it initializes the dp array and fills it using dynamic programming.
Finally, it prints the value of dp[n][n] as the output.
