The variable L, A, B, and M are initialized with 5, 3, 4, and 10007 respectively according to the input.
A 2D array m of size 3x3 is initialized with all elements as 0, except for m[1][0] and m[2][0] which are set to 1.
An array res of size 3 is initialized with elements 0, A%M, and B%M.
Two variables k and l are initialized with 10 and 0 respectively.
A while loop is executed until A is greater than k. In each iteration, k is multiplied by 10.
Inside the loop, the first element of the first row of the array m is set to k%M.
A variable r is calculated as the minimum of ((k - A - 1) / B) and (L - 1).
The function modpow is called with parameters m, r - l + 1, and M. This function calculates the power of matrix m to the exponent (r - l + 1) modulo M.
The function mult is called with parameters res and the result of modpow. This function multiplies the array res with the matrix result of modpow modulo M.
The value of l is updated to r + 1.
The value of k is multiplied by 10.
The loop continues until l is less than L.
Finally, the first element of the array res is printed as the output.
