<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers x and y from the input. It then checks if x modulo y is equal to 0. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the value of x. In this case, x modulo y is 2, which is not equal to 0. Therefore, the code will print the value of x, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
