<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` using the Scanner class. It then appends the character '2' to the end of the string `s`. The length of the string `s` is stored in the variable `n`. The variable `ans` is initialized with the value `n - 1`.

Then, a for loop is used to iterate over the characters of the string `s`. Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is different from the next character. If they are different, it calculates the maximum value between `i + 1` and `n - i - 2` and stores it in the variable `tmp`. It then updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum value between `ans` and `tmp`.

After the loop finishes, it prints the value of `ans` as the output.

In the given input `010`, the string `s` will be `0102`. The loop will iterate over the characters `0`, `1`, and `0`. The first and second characters are different, so `tmp` will be `1`. The second and third characters are the same, so `tmp` will be `2`. The final value of `ans` will be `1`.
