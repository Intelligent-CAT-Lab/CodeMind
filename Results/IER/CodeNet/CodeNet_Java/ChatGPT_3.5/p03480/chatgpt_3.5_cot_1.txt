<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` using the Scanner class. The input string is "010".
The code then appends the character '2' to the string `s`, making it "0102".
The code initializes the variable `n` with the length of the string `s`, which is 4, and the variable `ans` with `n - 1`, which is 3.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to `n - 2` (3 iterations).
Inside the loop, it checks if the character at index `i` is different from the character at index `i + 1`. In the first iteration, it checks if '0' is different from '1', which is true.
If the characters are different, it calculates the maximum value between `i + 1` and `n - i - 2` and assigns it to the variable `tmp`.
In the first iteration, `tmp` is assigned the value of `n - i - 2`, which is 2.
It then calculates the minimum value between `ans` and `tmp` and assigns it back to `ans`.
In the first iteration, `ans` is updated to 2.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of `ans`, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
