<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers A and B as input. It then calculates the value of L as the maximum of (A - B) and 2, and the value of H as the sum of A and B.
Next, it calls the `primes` method to generate a list of prime numbers up to the square root of H.
It initializes two arrays, `count` and `ok`, with the length of (H - L + 1), and sets all elements of `ok` to true.
Then, it iterates through the prime numbers in reverse order. For each prime number p, it calculates the value of div as the ceiling of (L / p), and iterates from div * p to H in steps of p. For each iteration, it calculates the number of times p divides the current position pos, and stores it in the `count` array. If the current count is greater than the previous count for the same position, it sets the corresponding element in the `ok` array to false.
Finally, it counts the number of elements in the `ok` array that are true and prints the result as the output.
