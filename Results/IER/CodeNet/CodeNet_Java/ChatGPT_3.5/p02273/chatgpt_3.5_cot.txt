The code defines a class `Tuple` with two double variables `x` and `y` and a method `print()` to print the values of `x` and `y`.
The code also defines a method `koch()` which takes an integer `n` and two `Tuple` objects `a` and `b` as parameters.
Inside the `koch()` method, it checks if `n` is equal to 0. If it is, it returns without doing anything.
Otherwise, it calculates three new `Tuple` objects `s`, `t`, and `u` based on the values of `a` and `b`.
It then recursively calls the `koch()` method with `n-1` and the appropriate `Tuple` objects as parameters.
Finally, it calls the `print()` method on `s`, `u`, and `t` to print their values.

In the `main()` method, it creates a `Scanner` object to read input from the user.
It reads an integer `n` from the user and creates two `Tuple` objects `a` and `b` with initial values (0.0, 0.0) and (100.0, 0.0) respectively.
It then calls the `print()` method on `a` to print its initial value.
Next, it calls the `koch()` method with `n`, `a`, and `b` as parameters.
Finally, it calls the `print()` method on `b` to print its final value.

Based on the code, the return value of `1` would be the output of the program.
