<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1 according to the input. And two Tuple objects a and b are created with coordinates (0.0, 0.0) and (100.0, 0.0) respectively.
Then it calls the koch() method passing n, a and b as arguments.
Inside the koch() method, it checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it returns and does nothing.
If n is not 0, it creates three new Tuple objects s, t and u. It calculates the coordinates of s, t and u based on the given formulas.
Then it recursively calls the koch() method four times with different arguments: (a, s), (s, u), (u, t), (t, b).
After the recursive calls, it prints the coordinates of s, u and t using the print() method of the Tuple class.
Finally, it prints the coordinates of b using the print() method of the Tuple class.
