The variable N is initialized with 10000 according to the input. And variable rootN is initialized with the square root of N.
A variable min is initialized with the maximum value of an integer.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to rootN to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration.
If N is divisible by i, it calculates the maximum digit count between i and N/i using the digitCount() method.
If the calculated digit count is less than the current value of min, it updates min with the new value.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of min as output.
In this case, the for loop iterates from 1 to 100, and the digit count of 1 and 10000 is 1 and 5 respectively.
Therefore, the output would be 1.
