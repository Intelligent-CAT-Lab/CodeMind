<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four integers N, A, B, and C from the input. It then calculates the values of Awin, Bwin, and num based on these input values. 

Next, it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to N-1. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of ret by performing several calculations using the comb, modpow, and modulo operations. The final value of ret is printed as the output.

The comb function calculates the binomial coefficient using the precalculated arrays xs and ys. The modpow function calculates the modular exponentiation of a to the power of n.
