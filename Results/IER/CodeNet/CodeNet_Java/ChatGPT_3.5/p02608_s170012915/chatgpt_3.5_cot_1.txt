<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the value 20 according to the input. 
An array ans of size N is created to store the count of numbers that can be expressed as the sum of squares of three integers.
There are three nested for loops that iterate from 1 to the square root of N. These loops represent the three integers i, j, and k.
Inside the nested loops, the sum of squares of i, j, and k along with the sum of their products is calculated and stored in the variable n.
If n is less than or equal to N, then the count of n is incremented in the ans array.
After the loops finish, the counts of all numbers that can be expressed as the sum of squares of three integers are printed.
