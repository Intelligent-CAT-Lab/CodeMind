<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then checks if the first character of the array is '0' or the last character is '1'. If either of these conditions is true, it prints -1 and returns.
If the above conditions are not met, it initializes an ArrayList of Edge objects and sets the root variable to 1 and is1 variable to true.
Then it iterates over the character array from index 0 to length-2. Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is not equal to the character at the corresponding position from the end of the array. If this condition is true, it prints -1 and returns.
If the above condition is not met, it adds a new Edge object to the ArrayList with the root as the starting point and the current index+1 as the ending point. It then checks if the current character is '1' and updates the root variable accordingly. If the current character is not '1', it sets the is1 variable to false.
After the loop, it prints the starting and ending points of each Edge object in the ArrayList. Finally, it prints either "1 length" or "root length" based on the value of is1 variable.
