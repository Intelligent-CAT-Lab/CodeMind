The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable res is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of res by 3 and takes the modulo of MODULO. The value of res becomes 3 in the first iteration and 9 in the second iteration.
After the loop finishes, it initializes the variable p2 with 2.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n/2-1. In each iteration, it calculates a new value for res by subtracting the product of facts[n], invfacts[na], invfacts[n-na] and p2 from the current value of res. It also takes the modulo of MODULO after each subtraction. The value of p2 is multiplied by 2 in each iteration.
Finally, it checks if the value of res is negative. If it is, it adds MODULO to res.
After all the calculations, it prints the final value of res as output.
