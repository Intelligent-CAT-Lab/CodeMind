<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input. The variable max is calculated as the ceiling value of the square root of n, which is 4. 
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 4 to 1. Inside the loop, it checks if n is divisible by the current value of i. If it is, it calculates the value of x as n divided by i. 
Then it prints the value of (i - 1) + (x - 1) as output and returns, which is 4 + 1 = 5.
<<<Output>>>
