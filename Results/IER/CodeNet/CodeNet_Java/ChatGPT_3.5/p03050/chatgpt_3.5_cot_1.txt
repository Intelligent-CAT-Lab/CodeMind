<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of n. Inside the loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it calculates the value of m as n divided by i minus 1.
Then it checks if i is less than m. If it is, it adds the value of m to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
