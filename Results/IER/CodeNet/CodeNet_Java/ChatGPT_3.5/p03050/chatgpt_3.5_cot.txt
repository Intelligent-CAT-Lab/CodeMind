<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input `n` and initializes a variable `ans` with 0. 
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of `n`. 
Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it calculates `m` as `n/i - 1`. 
If `i` is less than `m`, it adds `m` to `ans`. 
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of `ans` as the output.
In this case, the input is 8. The loop iterates from 1 to the square root of 8, which is 2. 
When `i` is 1, `n` is divisible by 1 and `m` is calculated as `8/1 - 1 = 7`. Since 1 is less than 7, 7 is added to `ans`. 
When `i` is 2, `n` is divisible by 2 and `m` is calculated as `8/2 - 1 = 3`. Since 2 is less than 3, 3 is added to `ans`. 
Therefore, the final value of `ans` is 7 + 3 = 10.
