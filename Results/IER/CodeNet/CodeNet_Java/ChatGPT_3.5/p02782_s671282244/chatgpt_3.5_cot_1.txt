<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: r1, c1, r2, and c2. It then initializes a Combination object with r2 + c2 + 10 and M (which is 1000000007). The code then calculates the answer using the function f() and performs some calculations on it. Finally, it prints the answer.

The function f() calculates the combination of (a + b) choose a using the choose() method of the Combination object.

The answer is calculated as follows:
1. Calculate f(r2 + 1, c2 + 1) and store it in the answer variable.
2. Subtract f(r2 + 1, c1) from the answer variable and take the modulo M. Store the result in the answer variable.
3. Subtract f(r1, c2 + 1) from the answer variable and take the modulo M. Store the result in the answer variable.
4. Add f(r1, c1) to the answer variable and take the modulo M. Store the result in the answer variable.
5. Print the answer variable.

The output will be the final value of the answer variable.
