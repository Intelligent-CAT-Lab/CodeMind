<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 6 and the variable D is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It checks if N is divisible by (D * 2 + 1). If it is, it prints N divided by (D * 2 + 1). Otherwise, it prints N divided by (D * 2 + 1) + 1.
In this case, 6 is divisible by (2 * 2 + 1) = 5. So, it prints 6 divided by 5, which is 1.
