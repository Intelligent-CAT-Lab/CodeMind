<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input. Then it checks if n is equal to 2. If it is, it prints -1 and returns. Since n is not equal to 2, it proceeds to the next if condition which checks if n is odd. If n is odd, it enters a nested for loop and initializes the 2D array A with values such that A[i][j] = (i+j)%n for each i and j. If n is not odd, it enters another set of nested for loops to initialize the 2D array A with values based on the value of n. Finally, it prints the values of the 2D array A.
