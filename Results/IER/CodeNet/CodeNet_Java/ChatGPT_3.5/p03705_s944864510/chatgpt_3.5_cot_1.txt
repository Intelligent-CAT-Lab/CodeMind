<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, a, and b are initialized with the values 4, 4, and 6 respectively according to the input.
The code then checks if a is greater than b. Since 4 is not greater than 6, the condition is false.
Next, it checks if n is greater than or equal to 2. Since 4 is greater than 2, the condition is true.
Inside the if statement, it calculates the output using the formula a + (n - 1) * b - a * (n - 1) - b + 1.
Substituting the values, we get 4 + (4 - 1) * 6 - 4 * (4 - 1) - 6 + 1 = 4 + 3 * 6 - 4 * 3 - 6 + 1 = 4 + 18 - 12 - 6 + 1 = 5.
Therefore, the output is 5.
