<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input: num_ball and num_box. It then calls the recursive function with these two values as arguments.
Inside the recursive function, it checks if the value of dp[num_ball][num_box] is already calculated. If it is, it returns the stored value.
If num_ball is 0 or num_box is 1, it returns 1.
Otherwise, it initializes a variable ret to 0.
It then iterates from next_box = 1 to num_box and calculates the value of next_ball as num_ball - next_box.
If next_ball is less than 0, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it recursively calls the recursive function with next_ball and next_box as arguments and adds the returned value to ret.
Finally, it stores the value of ret in dp[num_ball][num_box] and returns ret.
So, the return value of `5 3` would be the value returned by the recursive function with num_ball = 5 and num_box = 3.
