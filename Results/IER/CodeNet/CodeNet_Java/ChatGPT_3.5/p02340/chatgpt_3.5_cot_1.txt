<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes some constants and a 2D array dp with size 1005x1005. Then it reads two integers num_ball and num_box from the input.
It calls the recursive function with num_ball and num_box as arguments.
Inside the recursive function, it checks if the value of dp[num_ball][num_box] is already calculated. If it is, it returns the stored value.
Then it checks if num_ball is 0 or num_box is 1. If either of them is true, it returns 1.
Otherwise, it initializes a variable ret with 0.
It enters a for loop from next_box = 1 to num_box. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of next_ball as num_ball - next_box.
If next_ball is less than 0, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it adds the result of recursive(next_ball, next_box) to ret and takes the modulo with MOD.
After the loop finishes, it stores the value of ret in dp[num_ball][num_box] and returns ret.
Finally, it prints the result of recursive(num_ball, num_box) as the output.
