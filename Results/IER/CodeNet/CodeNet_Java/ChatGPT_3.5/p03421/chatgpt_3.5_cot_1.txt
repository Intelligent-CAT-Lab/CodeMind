The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. 
The calc method is called with these values.
In the calc method, a for loop is used to append the numbers from n-a+1 to n to the output StringBuilder.
Then, the variable rest is calculated as n-a-b+1.
If rest is less than 0, -1 is printed and the method returns.
If rest is greater than or equal to 1, the calcInner method is called with the values rest, a-1, and b-1.
If calcInner returns false, -1 is printed and the method returns.
After that, another for loop is used to append the numbers from n-a to rest+1 to the output StringBuilder.
Finally, the last character of the output StringBuilder is deleted and the output is printed.
