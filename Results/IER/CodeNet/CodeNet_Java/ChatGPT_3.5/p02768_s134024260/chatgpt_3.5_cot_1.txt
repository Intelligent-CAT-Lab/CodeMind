<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input. 
The code then calculates the value of ans using the binarypow function, which is the result of 2^n - 1. 
Then it calculates the value of comb using the combination function, which is the combination of n choose a. 
The code subtracts the value of comb from ans. 
Then it checks if ans is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it adds r to ans and takes the modulo r. 
Then it calculates the value of comb using the combination function again, which is the combination of n choose b. 
The code subtracts the value of comb from ans. 
Then it checks if ans is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it adds r to ans and takes the modulo r. 
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
