<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers a, b, and c from the input. Then it uses the Math.min() function to find the minimum value among a, b, and c, and uses the Math.max() function to find the maximum value among a, b, and c. Finally, it prints the minimum and maximum values separated by a space using the System.out.println() function and the String.format() method.

In this case, the input values are 4, 5, and 3. The minimum value among them is 3 and the maximum value is 5. Therefore, the output will be "3 5".

<<<Output>>>
3 5
