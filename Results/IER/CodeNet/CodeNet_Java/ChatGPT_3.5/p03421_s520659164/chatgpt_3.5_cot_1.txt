The variable n, variable A and variable B are initialized with 5, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. 
It checks if the condition check(n,A,B) is true. In this case, check(5,3,2) returns true.
Then it creates a PrintWriter object to print the output.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3. The value of variable cnt is also passed to variable len.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable len as Math.min(2, 5-1-3+1+1) = 2.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1. The value of variable j is also passed to variable len.
Inside the nested for loop, it prints the value of variable lowerBound+len-j, which is 0+2-0 = 2 and 0+2-1 = 1.
After the loop finishes, it flushes the PrintWriter object to print the output.
