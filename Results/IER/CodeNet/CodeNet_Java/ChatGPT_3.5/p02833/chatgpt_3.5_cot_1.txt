<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input. 
It checks if n is odd. If it is, it prints 0 and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes the variable ans with 0 and the variable base with 10.
Then it enters a while loop. In each iteration, it checks if base is greater than n. If it is, it breaks the loop.
Inside the loop, it adds n divided by base to ans and multiplies base by 5.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
