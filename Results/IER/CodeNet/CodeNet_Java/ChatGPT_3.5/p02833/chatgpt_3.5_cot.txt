<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input integer `n` and checks if it is odd. If `n` is odd, it returns 0. Otherwise, it initializes a variable `ans` to 0 and a variable `base` to 10. It then enters a while loop that continues until `base` becomes greater than `n`. In each iteration of the loop, it adds `n` divided by `base` to `ans` and multiplies `base` by 5. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.
In this case, `n` is 12 which is even. So, it enters the while loop and performs the following calculations:
- Iteration 1: `ans` = 12 / 10 = 1, `base` = 10 * 5 = 50
- Iteration 2: `ans` = 12 / 50 = 1, `base` = 50 * 5 = 250
Since `base` becomes greater than `n` (12), the while loop terminates. The value of `ans` is 1 + 1 = 2.
