<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized with 10000 according to the input. And variable max is initialized with the maximum value of integer.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of num to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it checks if num is divisible by i. If it is, it calculates the quotient and remainder of num divided by i and stores them in variables s and str respectively.
Then it calculates the maximum length between s and str and compares it with the current value of max. If it is smaller than max, it updates max with the new value.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable max as output.
