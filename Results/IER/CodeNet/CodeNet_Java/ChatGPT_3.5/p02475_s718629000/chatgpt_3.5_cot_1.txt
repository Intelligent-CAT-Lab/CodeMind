<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class and stores them in BigInteger objects A and B. Then it closes the scanner. 
After that, it divides A by B using the divide() method of the BigInteger class and prints the result.
In this case, A is 5 and B is 8. So the output will be the result of dividing 5 by 8, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
