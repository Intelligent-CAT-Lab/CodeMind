<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes a 3D array called dp with dimensions (n+1) x 26 x 2, where n is the length of the input string. The dp array is used to store the minimum number of changes required to convert the string into a lexicographically smallest string.

The code then iterates through the characters of the input string in reverse order. For each character, it updates the dp array based on the minimum number of changes required to convert the remaining substring into a lexicographically smallest string. It also keeps track of the previous character that was used to achieve the minimum number of changes.

Finally, the code constructs the lexicographically smallest string by traversing the dp array and appending the characters to a StringBuilder. The resulting string is then printed as the output.
