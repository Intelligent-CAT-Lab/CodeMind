<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: x, k, and d. It calculates the remainder (rem) when x is divided by d and the quotient (quo) when x is divided by d. 
Then it checks if k is less than quo. If it is, it calculates the absolute difference between x and (k * d) and prints it as the output.
If k is greater than or equal to quo, it calculates v1 as rem - d and rem1 as k - quo. 
If rem1 is even, it prints the absolute value of rem as the output. 
If rem1 is odd, it prints the absolute value of v1 as the output.
