<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable "today". 
Then it checks the value of "today" using if-else statements. 
If "today" is equal to "Sunny", it prints "Cloudy". 
If "today" is equal to "Cloudy", it prints "Rainy". 
If "today" is neither "Sunny" nor "Cloudy", it prints "Sunny". 
In this case, the input is "Sunny", so the condition "today.equals("Sunny")" is true and it prints "Cloudy".
<<<Output>>>
Cloudy
