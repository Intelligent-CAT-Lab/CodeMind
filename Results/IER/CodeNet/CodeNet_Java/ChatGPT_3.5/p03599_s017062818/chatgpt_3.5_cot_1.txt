<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 integers as input: A, B, C, D, E, and F. It initializes variables ans, water, and sugar with -1, 0, and 0 respectively.
Then it enters a nested for loop to iterate through all possible combinations of a, b, c, and d.
Inside the nested for loop, it checks if the condition C*c+D*d > (A*a+B*b)*E || a+b==0 is true. If it is true, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Otherwise, it calculates the ratio buf = (C*c+D*d)/(100 * (A*a+B*b) + C*c+D*d) and checks if it is greater than the current value of ans. If it is, it updates ans, water, and sugar with the current values of buf, (A*a+B*b)*100, and C*c+D*d respectively.
After the nested for loop finishes, it prints the sum of water and sugar followed by the value of sugar as output.
In this case, the final values of water and sugar are 200 and 20 respectively, so the output will be "220 20".
