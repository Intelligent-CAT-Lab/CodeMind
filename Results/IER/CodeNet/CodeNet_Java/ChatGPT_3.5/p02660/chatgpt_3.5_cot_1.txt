<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 24 according to the input. 
It checks if n is equal to 1. Since n is not equal to 1, it continues to the next step.
It initializes an empty HashMap called pMap to store prime factors and their counts.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of n. For each iteration, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it counts the number of times i divides n and stores it in the variable count. It then divides n by i. If count is greater than 0, it adds i and count to the pMap.
After the for loop, it checks if n is not equal to 1. If it is not equal to 1, it means n is a prime number and it adds n and 1 to the pMap.
It initializes a variable ans with 0.
It enters a for loop to iterate through the values of pMap. For each value, it initializes a variable i with 1. It enters a while loop and it continues as long as pCount is greater than or equal to i. In each iteration, it subtracts i from pCount, increments ans by 1, and increments i by 1.
After the for loop, it prints the value of ans as the output, which is the total count of prime factors.
