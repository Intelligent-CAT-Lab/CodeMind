The variable n is initialized with 24 according to the input. 
It checks if n is equal to 1. Since n is not equal to 1, it continues to the next step.
It initializes an empty HashMap called pMap to store prime factors of n and their counts.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of n. For each iteration, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it counts the number of times i divides n and updates the value of n by dividing it by i. If the count is greater than 0, it adds the prime factor i and its count to the pMap.
After the for loop, it checks if n is not equal to 1. If it is not equal to 1, it means that n is a prime number and it adds n and its count 1 to the pMap.
It initializes a variable ans with 0 to store the final answer.
It enters a for-each loop to iterate through the values of pMap, which are the counts of prime factors.
Inside the for-each loop, it initializes a variable i with 1 and enters a while loop. The while loop continues as long as the count of the prime factor is greater than or equal to i. In each iteration, it subtracts i from the count, increments ans by 1, and increments i by 1.
After the for-each loop, it prints the final value of ans as the output.
