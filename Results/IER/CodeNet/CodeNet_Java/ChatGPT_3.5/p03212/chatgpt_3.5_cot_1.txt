The variable N is initialized with 575 according to the input. A set called "set" is created to store unique strings. An instance of the Main class is created. A queue called "queue" is created and initialized with 6 strings: "357", "375", "537", "573", "735", "753". A variable count is initialized with 0. An array of characters called "ch" is created with values {'3', '5', '7'}.

If N is less than 1000, it enters a for-each loop to iterate through each string in the queue. If the long value of the string is less than or equal to N, it increments the count variable. After the loop, it prints the value of count and returns.

If N is greater than or equal to 1000, it enters a while loop as long as the queue is not empty. It removes the first string from the queue and checks if its long value is less than or equal to N. If it is, it increments the count variable. Then, it enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates through each character position in the string. The inner loop iterates through each character in the "ch" array. It calls the addChar method to add the character at the current position in the string. If the resulting string is not already in the set, it adds it to the set and the queue.

After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of count.
