<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then uses the replaceAll() method to replace all occurrences of the comma (",") with a space (" "). Finally, it prints the modified string as the output.
In this case, the input string is "happy,newyear,enjoy". The code will replace the comma with a space, resulting in the string "happy newyear enjoy".
<<<Output>>>
happy newyear enjoy
