The variable n is initialized with the value 2 according to the input. 
Then, an array called base is created with size n and each element is assigned a value from 1 to n.
The method make is called with initial values of value=0, mask=0, base=array, and size=n.
Inside the make method, there is a base case where if the mask is equal to (1 << size) - 1, it means all the bits in the mask are set to 1, so the method adds the current value to the TreeSet called all and returns.
If the base case is not met, the method multiplies the value by 10 and then iterates through each element in the base array.
If the i-th bit in the mask is already set to 1, it means that the i-th element in the base array has already been used, so it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it calls the make method recursively with the updated value, mask, base, and size by adding the i-th element to the value and setting the i-th bit in the mask to 1.
After the make method finishes, a StringBuilder is created to store the output.
Then, for each element x in the TreeSet called all, the toString method is called to convert x into a char array and append it to the StringBuilder.
Finally, the StringBuilder is printed as the output.
