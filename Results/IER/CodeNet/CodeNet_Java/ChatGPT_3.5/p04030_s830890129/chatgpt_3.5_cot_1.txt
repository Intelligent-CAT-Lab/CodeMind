<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and initializes an empty StringBuilder object. It then iterates through each character in the input string. If the character is 'B', it checks if the StringBuilder object is not empty. If it is not empty, it deletes the last character from the StringBuilder object. If the character is not 'B', it appends the character to the StringBuilder object. After iterating through all the characters in the input string, it prints the final value of the StringBuilder object as the output.

In this case, the input string is "01B0". The code iterates through each character:
- '0': It is not 'B', so it appends '0' to the StringBuilder object.
- '1': It is not 'B', so it appends '1' to the StringBuilder object.
- 'B': It is 'B', so it checks if the StringBuilder object is not empty. It is not empty, so it deletes the last character ('1') from the StringBuilder object.
- '0': It is not 'B', so it appends '0' to the StringBuilder object.

After iterating through all the characters, the final value of the StringBuilder object is "00". Therefore, the output would be "00".
