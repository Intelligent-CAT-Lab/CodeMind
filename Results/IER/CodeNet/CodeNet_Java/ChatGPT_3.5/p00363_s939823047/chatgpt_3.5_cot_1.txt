The variable W, H and c are initialized with 3, 3 and 'B' respectively according to the input.
It creates a StringBuilder object sb to store the output.
It enters a nested for loop to iterate through each row and column of the flag.
Inside the nested for loop, it checks the current position (i, j) and appends the corresponding character to the StringBuilder sb based on the following conditions:
- If the current position is at the top-left or bottom-right corner, it appends '+'.
- If the current position is at the top or bottom row (excluding the corners), it appends '-'.
- If the current position is at the left or right column (excluding the corners), it appends '|'.
- If the current position is at the center of the flag, it appends the character 'B'.
- For all other positions, it appends '.'.
After the nested for loop finishes, it appends a new line character '\n' to the StringBuilder sb.
This process is repeated for each row of the flag.
Finally, it prints the contents of the StringBuilder sb as the output.
