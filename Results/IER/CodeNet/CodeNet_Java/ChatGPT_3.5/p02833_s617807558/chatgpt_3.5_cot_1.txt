<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input. 
It checks if n is odd or even. Since 12 is even, it continues to execute the code inside the if statement.
It initializes the variable result with 0 and variable s with 1.
It divides n by 2 and assigns the result back to n.
Then it enters a while loop that continues until the condition is false.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of num by dividing n by 5 raised to the power of s.
It increments s by 1.
It adds the value of num to the variable result.
If num is 0, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of result as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
