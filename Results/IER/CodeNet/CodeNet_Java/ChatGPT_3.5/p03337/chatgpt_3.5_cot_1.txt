<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the input. Then it calculates the maximum value among a+b, a-b, and a*b using the Math.max() function. Finally, it prints the maximum value as the output.
In this case, a=3 and b=1. So, the maximum value among a+b (3+1=4), a-b (3-1=2), and a*b (3*1=3) is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
