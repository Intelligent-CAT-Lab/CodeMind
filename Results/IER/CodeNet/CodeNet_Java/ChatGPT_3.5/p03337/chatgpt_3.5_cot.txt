<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers, `a` and `b`, from the input. It then calculates the maximum value among `a + b`, `a - b`, and `a * b` using the `Math.max()` function. Finally, it prints the result.

In this case, `a` is 3 and `b` is 1. So, the maximum value among `a + b` (3 + 1 = 4), `a - b` (3 - 1 = 2), and `a * b` (3 * 1 = 3) is 4.

<<<Output>>>
4
