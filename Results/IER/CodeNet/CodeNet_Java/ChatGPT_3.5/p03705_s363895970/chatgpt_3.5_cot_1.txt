The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 4 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It checks if A is greater than B, if it is, it prints 0 and returns. In this case, A is not greater than B, so it continues.
It checks if A is equal to B, if it is, it prints 1 and returns. In this case, A is not equal to B, so it continues.
It checks if N is equal to 1, if it is, it prints 0 and returns. In this case, N is not equal to 1, so it continues.
It checks if N is equal to 2, if it is, it prints 1 and returns. In this case, N is not equal to 2, so it continues.
Finally, it prints the value of (B-A)*(N-2) + 1 as output, which is 3.
