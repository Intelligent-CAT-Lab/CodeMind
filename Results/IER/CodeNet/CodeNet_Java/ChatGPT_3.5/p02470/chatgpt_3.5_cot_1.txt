The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input.
It calls the method totient() of the Euler class and passes the value of n to it.
Inside the totient() method, it initializes the variable i and phi with the value of n.
Then it checks if i is divisible by 2. If it is, it divides phi by 2 and keeps dividing i by 2 until i is no longer divisible by 2.
Then it checks if i is divisible by 3. If it is, it divides phi by 3 and keeps dividing i by 3 until i is no longer divisible by 3.
After that, it enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to infinity. Inside the loop, it checks if i * 6 - 1 is greater than the value of n. If it is, it breaks the loop.
Inside the loop, it checks if i is divisible by i * 6 - 1. If it is, it divides phi by i * 6 - 1 and keeps dividing i by i * 6 - 1 until i is no longer divisible by i * 6 - 1.
Then it checks if i * 6 + 1 is greater than the value of n. If it is, it breaks the loop.
Inside the loop, it checks if i is divisible by i * 6 + 1. If it is, it divides phi by i * 6 + 1 and keeps dividing i by i * 6 + 1 until i is no longer divisible by i * 6 + 1.
Finally, it checks if i is not equal to 1. If it is not, it divides phi by i and multiplies it by i - 1.
After all the calculations, it returns the value of phi as the output.
