<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer `n` from the input. Then it calls the `totient` method of the `Euler` class and passes `n` as an argument. The `totient` method calculates the Euler's totient function for the given number `n` and returns the result. The Euler's totient function calculates the number of positive integers less than or equal to `n` that are relatively prime to `n`. The `totient` method uses a loop to iterate through all the numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number is a prime number. If a number is prime, it updates the value of `phi` by dividing it by the prime number and multiplying it by the prime number minus one. Finally, the `totient` method returns the value of `phi` for the given number `n`.
