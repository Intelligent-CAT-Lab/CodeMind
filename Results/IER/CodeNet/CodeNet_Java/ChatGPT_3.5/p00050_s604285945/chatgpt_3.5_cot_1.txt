<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using the Scanner class. It enters a while loop and continues to execute as long as there is more input available. Inside the loop, it reads a line of input and stores it in the variable str. Then it replaces all occurrences of the word "apple" with the word "temp" in the string str. Next, it replaces all occurrences of the word "peach" with the word "apple" in the string str. Finally, it replaces all occurrences of the word "temp" with the word "peach" in the string str. The modified string str is then printed to the console. This process continues until there is no more input available.

In this case, the input string is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple.". The code replaces "apple" with "temp", "peach" with "apple", and "temp" with "peach" in that order. Therefore, the output string would be "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.".

<<<Output>>>
the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.
