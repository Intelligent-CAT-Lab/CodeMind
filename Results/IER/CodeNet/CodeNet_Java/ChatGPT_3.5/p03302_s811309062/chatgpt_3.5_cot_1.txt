<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input using the Scanner class. The first integer is assigned to variable a and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
Then, it initializes a String variable ans.
Next, it checks if the sum of a and b is equal to 15. If it is, it assigns the value "+" to ans.
If the sum is not equal to 15, it checks if the product of a and b is equal to 15. If it is, it assigns the value "*" to ans.
If neither condition is true, it assigns the value "x" to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the sum of 4 and 11 is not equal to 15, and their product is also not equal to 15. Therefore, the value of ans will be "x".
<<<Output>>>
x
