<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b respectively.
Then it checks if any of the following conditions are true:
1. a is divisible by 3
2. b is divisible by 3
3. the sum of a and b is divisible by 3

If any of these conditions are true, it prints "Possible". Otherwise, it prints "Impossible".

In this case, a = 4 and b = 5. Neither a nor b is divisible by 3, and the sum of a and b is 9, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, the condition (a + b) % 3 == 0 is true, and the output will be "Possible".
<<<Output>>>
