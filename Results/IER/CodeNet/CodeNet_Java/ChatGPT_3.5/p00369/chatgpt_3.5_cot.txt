<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `S` and performs two checks on it: `checkEqual(S)` and `check12(S)`. 

In the `checkEqual(S)` method, it checks if the string `S` can be divided into equal parts of length `k` (where `k` is a factor of the length of `S`). It then finds the maximum and minimum values within each part and calculates the difference between them using the `sub()` method. It keeps track of the minimum difference found so far and returns it as the answer.

In the `check12(S)` method, it iterates through each character of `S` and checks if it is equal to '1'. If it is, it checks the next character and combines them to form a two-digit number. It finds the maximum and minimum values among these numbers and calculates the difference between them. It returns the maximum difference found as the answer.

Finally, in the `solve()` method, it takes an input string `S` and prints the minimum value between the results of `checkEqual(S)` and `check12(S)`.
