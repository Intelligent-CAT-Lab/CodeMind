<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input `S` and performs two checks: `checkEqual(S)` and `check12(S)`. 

In the `checkEqual(S)` method, it iterates over the length of `S` and checks if the length of `S` is divisible by `k`. If it is, it sets `mins` and `maxs` to be equal to the substring of `S` from index 0 to `k`. Then, it iterates over `S` in increments of `k` and compares each substring with `maxs` and `mins`. If a substring is greater than `maxs`, it updates `maxs`, and if it is smaller than `mins`, it updates `mins`. Finally, it calculates the difference between `maxs` and `mins` using the `sub(maxs, mins)` method and returns the minimum difference found.

In the `check12(S)` method, it iterates over each character in `S`. If the current character is '1' and there is a next character, it converts the next character to an integer and adds 10 to it. Otherwise, it converts the current character to an integer. It keeps track of the maximum and minimum values found during the iteration. Finally, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

In the `solve()` method, it takes input from the user and calls both `checkEqual(S)` and `check12(S)`. It prints the minimum value between the two.

In the `main()` method, it creates an instance of the `Main` class and calls the `solve()` method.

So, the code will take the input string "11121314" and calculate the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum values found using both methods. It will then print the minimum value.
