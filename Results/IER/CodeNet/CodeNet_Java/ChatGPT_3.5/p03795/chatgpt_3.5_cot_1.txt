<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
Then it calculates the output using the formula (n * 800) - ((n / 15) * 200).
The value of n is multiplied by 800 and then the value of (n / 15) is multiplied by 200.
Finally, the second result is subtracted from the first result and printed as the output.
<<<Output>>>
12000
