<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Then it calculates the return value using the formula `(n * 800) - ((n / 15) * 200)`. The value of `n` is multiplied by 800 and then the value of `n` divided by 15 is multiplied by 200. The second result is subtracted from the first result to get the final return value.
<<<Output>>>
22000
