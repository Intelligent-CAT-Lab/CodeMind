The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable res is initialized with 7, p2 is initialized with 8, num is initialized with 1 and den is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n-1 to calculate the value of res. Inside the loop, it multiplies res by 9 and adds an increment value to it. The increment value is calculated based on the values of p2, num and den.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of res as output.
