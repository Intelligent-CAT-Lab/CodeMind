<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer from the input and divides it by 2 to get the value of variable n. Then it initializes the variable res with 7 and the variable p2 with 8. It also initializes the variables num and den with 1 and 2 respectively.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to n-1. In each iteration, it multiplies the variable res by 9 and checks if the current iteration is greater than 1. If it is, it calculates the value of the variable inc by multiplying p2, num and the modular inverse of den. It adds the value of inc to res.
Then it updates the value of p2 by multiplying it by 2. It updates the values of num and den based on the current iteration.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of res as the output.
