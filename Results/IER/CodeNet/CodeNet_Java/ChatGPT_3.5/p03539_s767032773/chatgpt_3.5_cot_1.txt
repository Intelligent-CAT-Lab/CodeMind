<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and k from the input. It then initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions (n+1) x (n*n+10) and sets dp[n][0] to 1. 
Then it enters a nested for loop where it iterates from n-1 to 0 and from 0 to the length of dp[i+1]. 
Inside the nested loop, it checks if the current value of dp[i+1][add] is 0. If it is, it continues to the next iteration. 
Otherwise, it enters another for loop where it iterates from 0 to k. 
Inside this loop, it calculates the new value of nadd based on the current value of add and j. 
Then it adds the current value of dp[i+1][add] to dp[i][nadd] and takes the modulo of the sum with mod. 
After the nested loop finishes, it calculates the value of res by multiplying k*(k+1)/2. 
Then it enters a for loop where it iterates from 0 to n-2. Inside the loop, it multiplies res by (k+1) and takes the modulo of the product with mod. 
After the loop finishes, it multiplies res by n and takes the modulo of the product with mod. 
Finally, it enters another for loop where it iterates from 1 to the length of dp[0]. 
Inside the loop, it subtracts sub*dp[0][sub] from res and takes the modulo of the difference with mod. 
If res becomes negative, it adds mod to res. 
Finally, it prints the value of res as the output.
