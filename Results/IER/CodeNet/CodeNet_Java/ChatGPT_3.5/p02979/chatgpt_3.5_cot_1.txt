<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers n, k, and mod from the input. Then it checks if k is even or odd.
If k is even, it calls the solve2() method with parameters n/2 and k/2+1, and multiplies the result with the solve2() method with parameters (n+1)/2 and k/2+1. The result is then printed.
If k is odd, it creates a 2D array dyn[][] with size k+2. It initializes dyn[0][0] to 1. It also creates another 2D array ndyn[][] with the same size.
Then it enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to (n | 1) / 2 + k / 2 + 2. The inner loop iterates over the mask variable, which is a binary representation of the current value of m.
Inside the inner loop, it calculates the values of nj and njj based on the current value of m and the values of j and jj. It then updates the ndyn[][] array with the calculated values.
After the inner loop finishes, it swaps the dyn[][] and ndyn[][] arrays.
After the outer loop finishes, it calculates the sum of all elements in the dyn[][] array and prints the result.
