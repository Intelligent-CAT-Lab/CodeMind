<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers n, k, and mod from the input. Then it checks if k is even or odd.
If k is even, it calls the solve2() method with n/2 and k/2+1 as arguments and multiplies the result with the solve2() method with (n+1)/2 and k/2+1 as arguments. The result is then printed.
If k is odd, it creates a 2D array dyn[][] with size k+2 and initializes it with 0. It also creates another 2D array ndyn[][] with the same size and initializes it with 0.
Then it enters a nested for loop to calculate the values of ndyn[][] based on the values of dyn[][].
After that, it swaps the values of dyn[][] and ndyn[][] and repeats the process until the loop finishes.
Finally, it calculates the sum of all elements in dyn[][] and prints the result.
