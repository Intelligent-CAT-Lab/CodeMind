<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then calculates the length of the input string using the length() method. Finally, it prints a substring of the input string starting from index 0 and ending at length-8. In this case, the input string is "CODEFESTIVAL" and its length is 12. So, the substring will be "CODEFEST".

<<<Output>>>
CODEFEST
