<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then calculates the length of the input string using the length() method. Finally, it prints a substring of the input string starting from index 0 and ending at the length of the string minus 8.

In this case, the input string is "CODEFESTIVAL" which has a length of 12. Therefore, the substring will start from index 0 and end at index 4 (12 - 8). The substring will be "CODE" and that will be the output.
