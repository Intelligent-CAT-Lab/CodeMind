<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable X are initialized with 4 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable LEN is initialized with 7.
It enters the solve() method to check if N is equal to 2. Since N is not equal to 2, it proceeds to the next condition.
It checks if X is between 2 and 2*N-2 (which is 6) inclusive. Since X is equal to 4, it satisfies the condition and enters the if block.
Inside the if block, it initializes an array ans with length LEN (7).
It checks if X is equal to 2. Since X is not equal to 2, it proceeds to the else block.
Inside the else block, it assigns values to the elements of the ans array based on the value of X.
It assigns X-2 to ans[N-2], X to ans[N-1], X+1 to ans[N], and X-1 to ans[N+1].
Then it initializes a variable v with 1 and enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to LEN-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current index is between N-2 and N+1 inclusive. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it checks if v is between X-2 and X+1 inclusive. If it is, it sets v to X+2.
Then it assigns v to the current element of the ans array and increments v by 1.
After the for loop finishes, it returns the ans array.
Finally, it prints "Yes" and each element of the ans array on a new line.
