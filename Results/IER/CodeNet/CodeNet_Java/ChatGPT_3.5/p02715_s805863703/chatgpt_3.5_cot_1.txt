<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 and variable K is initialized with 2 according to the input.
Then it initializes the variable ans with 0 and creates an array num of size K+1 to store some values.
It enters a for loop and iterates from K to 1. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of kx which is K divided by x.
Then it adds the value of mpow(kx, N) to the element at index x in the array num.
Then it enters another for loop and iterates from 2*x to K with a step size of x. Inside this loop, it subtracts the value of num[j] from the element at index x in the array num.
After the inner loop finishes, it takes the modulo of the element at index x in the array num with MOD.
Then it adds the product of x and the element at index x in the array num to the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it takes the modulo of ans with MOD and adds MOD to it and then takes the modulo again.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
