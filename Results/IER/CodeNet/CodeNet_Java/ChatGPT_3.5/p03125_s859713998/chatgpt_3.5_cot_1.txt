<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and stores them in variables a and b respectively.
Then it checks if b modulo a is equal to 0. If it is, it adds a and b and prints the result. If it is not, it subtracts a from b and prints the result.
In this case, 12 modulo 4 is equal to 0, so the code will add 4 and 12 and print the result, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
