<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N. It then calculates the remainder (amari) when N is divided by 10 and the quotient (sho) when N is divided by 10. 
If the remainder is equal to 9, it prints "Yes". 
If the quotient is equal to 9, it also prints "Yes". 
Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the input is 29. The remainder is 9 and the quotient is 2. So, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
