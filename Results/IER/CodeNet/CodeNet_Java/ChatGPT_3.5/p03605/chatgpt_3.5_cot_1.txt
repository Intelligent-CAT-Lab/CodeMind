<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the value 29 according to the input.
Then it calculates the remainder of N divided by 10 and assigns it to the variable amari.
Next, it calculates the quotient of N divided by 10 and assigns it to the variable sho.
Then it checks if the value of amari is equal to 9. If it is, it prints "Yes".
If the value of amari is not equal to 9, it checks if the value of sho is equal to 9. If it is, it prints "Yes".
If neither amari nor sho is equal to 9, it prints "No".
In this case, the value of amari is not equal to 9 and the value of sho is not equal to 9, so it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
