<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable d and variable x are initialized with 1, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input. 
Then it initializes two arrays F and G with size 200001 and fills them with -1.
Then it assigns the value 0.5 to F[1] and 1 to G[1].
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 2 to 200000.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of F[i] and G[i] based on the previous values of F[i-1] and G[i-1].
Finally, it prints the value of F[n] * x + d * G[n] with 20 decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
3.00000000000000000000
