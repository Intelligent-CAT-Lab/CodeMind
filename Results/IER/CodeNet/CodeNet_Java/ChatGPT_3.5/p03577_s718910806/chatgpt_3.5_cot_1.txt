<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then uses the substring method to extract a substring from the input string. The substring starts from index 0 and ends at the length of the input string minus 8. This means it removes the last 8 characters from the input string. The resulting substring is stored in the variable ans. Finally, the code prints the value of ans as the output.

In this case, the input string is "CODEFESTIVAL". The length of the input string is 12. So, the substring will start from index 0 and end at index 4 (12 - 8 = 4). Therefore, the substring will be "CODE". This will be the output of the code execution.
