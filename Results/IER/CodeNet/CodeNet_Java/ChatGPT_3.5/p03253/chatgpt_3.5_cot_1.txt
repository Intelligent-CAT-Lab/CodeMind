The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 6 respectively according to the input. And variable res is initialized with the value of m.
Then variable ans is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of res to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of times i divides res and stores it in variable cnt. It keeps dividing res by i until it is no longer divisible by i.
Then it calculates the combination of cnt+n-1 choose n-1 using the calcComb method and multiplies it with ans. It takes the modulo of the result with MOD.
After the for loop, it checks if res is not equal to 1. If it is not equal to 1, it calculates the combination of n choose 1 using the calcComb method and multiplies it with ans. It takes the modulo of the result with MOD.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output.
