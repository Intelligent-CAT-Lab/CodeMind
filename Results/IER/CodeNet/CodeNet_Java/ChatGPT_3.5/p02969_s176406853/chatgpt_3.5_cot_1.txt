<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable r. Then it calculates the square of r multiplied by 3 and stores the result in a variable. Finally, it prints the value of the variable as the output.
In this case, the input is 4. So, the code will calculate 3 * 4 * 4, which is 48.
<<<Output>>>
48
