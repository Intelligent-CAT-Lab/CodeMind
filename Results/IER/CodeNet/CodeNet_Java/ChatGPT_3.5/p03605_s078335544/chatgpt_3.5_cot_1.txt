<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 29 according to the input. Then it converts the integer x to a string s using the Integer.toString() method.
It checks if the value of x falls within the range [10, 99]. If it does, it checks if the string s contains the character '9'. If it does, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the value of x is 29, which falls within the range [10, 99]. And the string s contains the character '9'. So the output would be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
