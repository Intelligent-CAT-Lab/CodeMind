<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable S. It then initializes a variable num with 0. 
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 15. Inside the loop, it checks if the character at index i in the string S is equal to the character at index i in the string "CODEFESTIVAL2016". If they are not equal, it increments the variable num by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of num as the output.
In this case, the characters at index 1 and index 9 in the string S are not equal to the corresponding characters in the string "CODEFESTIVAL2016", so the value of num will be 2.
