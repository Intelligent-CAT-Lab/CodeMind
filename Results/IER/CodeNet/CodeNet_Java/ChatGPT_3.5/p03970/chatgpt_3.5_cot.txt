<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string from the user and stores it in the variable S. It then compares each character of the input string with the corresponding character of the string "CODEFESTIVAL2016". If the characters are not equal, it increments the variable num by 1. After the loop finishes, it prints the value of num as the output.

In this case, the input string is "C0DEFESTIVAL2O16". The loop will iterate 16 times, comparing each character of the input string with the corresponding character of "CODEFESTIVAL2016". The characters at index 1 and 14 are not equal, so the variable num will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the output will be 1.
