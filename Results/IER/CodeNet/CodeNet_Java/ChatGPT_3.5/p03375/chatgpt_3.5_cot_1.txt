The variable N is initialized with 2 and variable M is initialized with 1000000007 according to the input.
Then the code calls the complex() method passing N as an argument. Inside the complex() method, it initializes a 2D array res with size (N+1) x (N+1) and sets the values of the first column and the diagonal to 1. Then it uses a nested for loop to calculate the values of the remaining elements of the array based on the formula res[i][j] = (res[i-1][j] + res[i-1][j-1]) % M. The calculated array res is stored in the variable C.
Next, the code calls the stirling() method passing N as an argument. Inside the stirling() method, it initializes a 2D array res with size (N+1) x (N+1) and sets the values of the first column and the diagonal to 1. Then it uses a nested for loop to calculate the values of the remaining elements of the array based on the formula res[i][j] = (res[i-1][j-1] + (j+1) * (res[i-1][j] % M)) % M. The calculated array res is stored in the variable S.
Then the code enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to N. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of the variable ans based on the formula ans = (ans + (i%2==0 ? 1:-1) * (C[N][i] * ways(i)) % M + (i%2==0 ? 0:M)) % M. The ways() method is called passing i as an argument. Inside the ways() method, it calculates the value of the variable res based on the formula res = (res + ways2(i, j, beki1, beki2)) % M, where beki1 and beki2 are calculated using the beki() method. The ways2() method is called passing i, j, beki1, and beki2 as arguments. Inside the ways2() method, it calculates the value of the variable res based on the formula res = ((S[i][j] * beki1) % M * beki2 % M) % M. Finally, the value of the variable ans is printed as the output.
