<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs: N and M. N is an integer and M is a long integer. 
Then it initializes two static variables: S and C as 2D arrays of long integers. The size of these arrays is determined by the value of N.
The code then calls two functions: complex(N) and stirling(N) to calculate the values of S and C arrays respectively.
Next, it initializes a variable ans as 0.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to N. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of ans by adding or subtracting a term based on the value of i.
The term is calculated as follows: (i%2==0 ? 1:-1)*(C[N][i]*ways(i))%M + (i%2==0 ? 0:M)
The function ways(i) calculates the number of ways to arrange i elements in a set of N elements. It uses the values of S and C arrays to calculate this.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
