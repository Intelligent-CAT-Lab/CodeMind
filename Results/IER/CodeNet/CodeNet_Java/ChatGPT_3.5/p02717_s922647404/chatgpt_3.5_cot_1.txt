<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input using the Scanner class and assigns them to variables X, Y, and Z respectively. Then it prints the values of Z, X, and Y separated by a space.
In this case, the input is "1 2 3", so X will be assigned the value 1, Y will be assigned the value 2, and Z will be assigned the value 3. Then it prints "3 1 2" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
3 1 2
