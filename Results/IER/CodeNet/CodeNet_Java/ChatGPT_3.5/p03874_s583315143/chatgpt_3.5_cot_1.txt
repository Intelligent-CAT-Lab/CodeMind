<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a 2D array C with size 701x701 and fills it with values using Pascal's triangle. Then it reads an integer n from the input. It creates a StringBuilder sb to store the output string. It iterates from i=650 to i=0. Inside the loop, it calculates the quotient m by dividing n by C[i+7][7]. If m is greater than 0, it sets the boolean variable first to false. Then it iterates from j=0 to j<m and appends 'L' to the beginning of sb. It updates n by taking the remainder of n divided by C[i+7][7]. Finally, it appends "FESTIVA" to the beginning of sb. After the loop finishes, it prints the value of sb as the output.
