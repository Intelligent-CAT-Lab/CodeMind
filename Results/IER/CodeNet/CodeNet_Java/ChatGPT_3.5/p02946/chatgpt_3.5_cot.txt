<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with 3 and variable X is initialized with 7 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from X - K + 1 to X + K - 1. In this case, it iterates from 7 - 3 + 1 to 7 + 3 - 1, which is from 5 to 9.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current value of i is equal to X + K - 1. If it is not, it prints the value of i followed by a space. If it is, it prints the value of i followed by a new line.
After the loop finishes, it does not return any value.
<<<Output>>>
5 6 7 8 9
