<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers, a and b, from the input. It then calculates three values: a + b, a - b, and a * b. Finally, it prints the maximum value among these three calculations.
In this case, a = -13 and b = 3. So, the three calculations are:
- a + b = -13 + 3 = -10
- a - b = -13 - 3 = -16
- a * b = -13 * 3 = -39
The maximum value among these three is -10. Therefore, the output will be -10.
<<<Output>>>
-10
