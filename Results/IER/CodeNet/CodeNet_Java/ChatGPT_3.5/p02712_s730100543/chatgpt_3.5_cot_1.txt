<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 15 according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5. If it is not divisible by both, it adds the current integer i to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable sum as output, which is 60.
<<<Output>>>
60
