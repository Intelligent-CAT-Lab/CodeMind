The code reads three integers from the input: k, A, and B. In this case, k=2, A=1, and B=3.
It then checks if the number of different bits between A and B is odd. In this case, A=01 and B=11, so the number of different bits is 1, which is odd.
Since the number of different bits is odd, it prints "YES" followed by the result of the recursive function go(A, B, 0, 0).
The go function takes four parameters: a, b, mask, and removed. In the first call, a=A=1, b=B=3, mask=0, and removed=0.
Inside the go function, it checks if the number of removed bits is equal to k-1. In this case, k=2, so it is not equal.
It then iterates through the bits of a and b to find a bit that is different and has not been removed yet. In this case, the bit at position 0 is different and has not been removed.
It sets k1=0 and updates the mask and removed variables.
Next, it finds a value for a1 by flipping one of the remaining bits in a. In this case, it flips the bit at position 1, so a1=2.
It makes two recursive calls to go: go(a, a1, mask, removed) and go((a1 ^ (1 << k1)), b, mask, removed).
The first recursive call is go(1, 2, 1, 1) and the second recursive call is go(3, 3, 1, 1).
Inside the first recursive call, it checks if the number of removed bits is equal to k-1. In this case, it is not equal.
It finds a bit that is different and has not been removed yet. In this case, the bit at position 1 is different and has not been removed.
It sets k1=1 and updates the mask and removed variables.
Next, it finds a value for a1 by flipping one of the remaining bits in a. In this case, it flips the bit at position 0, so a1=3.
It makes two recursive calls to go: go(a, a1, mask, removed) and go((a1 ^ (1 << k1)), b, mask, removed).
The first recursive call is go(1, 3, 3, 2) and the second recursive call is go(2, 2, 3, 2).
Inside the first recursive call, it checks if the number of removed bits is equal to k-1. In this case, it is not equal.
It finds a bit that is different and has not been removed yet. In this case, the bit at position 0 is different and has not been removed.
It sets k1=0 and updates the mask and removed variables.
Next, it finds a value for a1 by flipping one of the remaining bits in a. In this case, it flips the bit at position 1, so a1=3.
It makes two recursive calls to go: go(a, a1, mask, removed) and go((a1 ^ (1 << k1)), b, mask, removed).
The first recursive call is go(1, 3, 3, 3) and the second recursive call is go(3, 3, 3, 3).
Inside the first recursive call, it checks if the number of removed bits is equal to k-1. In this case, it is equal.
It appends the values of a and b to the output string: "1 3 ".
Inside the second recursive call, it checks if the number of removed bits is equal to k-1. In this case, it is equal.
It appends the values of a and b to the output string: "3 3 ".
Finally, it prints the output string: "YES\n1 3 3 3 ".
