The code defines a function called solve that takes two long integers h and w as input and returns a long integer as output. The function calculates the minimum difference between the areas of three rectangles that can be formed by dividing a given rectangle with dimensions h and w into smaller rectangles.

In the main function, the solve function is called with the input values 3 and 5. The expected output is the result of the solve function.

Inside the solve function, a variable ans is initialized with the maximum value of a long integer. Then, a nested loop is used to iterate over possible values of i and j. The outer loop iterates over values of i from the maximum of 1 and w/3 to the minimum of w/3 + 2 and w. The inner loop iterates over values of j from the maximum of 1 and h/2 to the minimum of h/2 + 2 and h.

Inside the nested loops, the areas of three rectangles are calculated using the values of i and j. The areas are stored in an array called sqs and sorted in ascending order. The difference between the maximum and minimum values in sqs is calculated and compared to the current value of ans. If the difference is smaller than ans, ans is updated with the new value.

The same process is repeated with different combinations of i and j to cover all possible rectangles that can be formed by dividing the given rectangle.

Finally, the value of ans is returned as the output of the solve function.
