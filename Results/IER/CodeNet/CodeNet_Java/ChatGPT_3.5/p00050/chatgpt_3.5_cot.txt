<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user. It then replaces the word "apple" with "wwwp" and the word "peach" with "wwwa" in the input string. Then it replaces "wwwp" with "peach" and "wwwa" with "apple" in the modified string. Finally, it prints the modified string as the output.

So, when the input string is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple.", the code will replace "apple" with "wwwp" and "peach" with "wwwa", resulting in the string "the cost of one wwwa is higher than that of one wwwp.". Then it will replace "wwwp" with "peach" and "wwwa" with "apple", resulting in the final string "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple.".

<<<Output>>>
the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple.
