<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user. It then replaces the word "apple" with "wwwp" and the word "peach" with "wwwa" in the input string. Then it replaces "wwwp" with "peach" and "wwwa" with "apple" in the modified string. Finally, it prints the modified string as the output.

In this case, the input string is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple.". The word "apple" is replaced with "wwwp" and the word "peach" is replaced with "wwwa". Then "wwwp" is replaced with "peach" and "wwwa" is replaced with "apple". So the final modified string is "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.".

<<<Output>>>
the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.
