<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and calculates the sum of its digits using the `sumDigits` method. It then checks if `n` is divisible by the sum of its digits. If it is divisible, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the input `n` is 12. The `sumDigits` method calculates the sum of the digits of 12, which is 1 + 2 = 3. Then, it checks if 12 is divisible by 3. Since 12 is divisible by 3, the code will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
