<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and calculates the sum of its digits using the `sumDigits` method. It then checks if `n` is divisible by the sum of its digits. If it is divisible, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the input is 12. The sum of its digits is 1 + 2 = 3. Since 12 is not divisible by 3, the output will be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
