<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the console. It then reads an integer value from the input using the `nextInt()` method and assigns it to variable `a`. 
The code then subtracts the value of `a` from 48 and prints the result as output.
In this case, the value of `a` is 21. So, 48 - 21 = 27.
<<<Output>>>
27
