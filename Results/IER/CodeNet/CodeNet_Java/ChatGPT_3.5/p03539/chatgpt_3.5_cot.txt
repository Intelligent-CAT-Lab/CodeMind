<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It then performs a series of calculations to determine the return value.

First, it calculates the value of pownk1, which is the power of (k+1) raised to the power of (n-1). It uses a loop to multiply (k+1) with pownk1 and takes the modulo with MOD (1000000007) at each step.

Next, it initializes a variable total to 0. It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k. In each iteration, it multiplies i with pownk1 and takes the modulo with MOD. It adds this value to total and takes the modulo with MOD again.

After that, it initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions (n+1) and (maxha+1), where maxha is 100000. It sets the value of dp[n][0] to 1.

Then, it enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from n to 1, and the inner loop iterates from 0 to maxha. In each iteration, it checks the value of dp[head][ha]. If it is 0, it continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to k. In each iteration, it checks if l is less than or equal to head. If it is, it calculates the value of canha as (ha + l) / head. It then adds the value of base (dp[head][ha]) to dp[head-1][ha+canha] and takes the modulo with MOD. If l is greater than head, it adds the value of base to dp[head-1][ha] and takes the modulo with MOD.

After the nested loop finishes, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to maxha. In each iteration, it calculates the value of dec as dp[0][i] multiplied by i and takes the modulo with MOD. It subtracts dec from total and takes the modulo with MOD.

Finally, it prints the value of total modulo MOD.
