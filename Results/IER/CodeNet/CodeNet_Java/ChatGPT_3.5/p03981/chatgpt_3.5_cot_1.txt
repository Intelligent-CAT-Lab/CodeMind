<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string input and converts it into a character array. Then it calls the `suffixArray` method from the `SuffixArray` class to generate the suffix array of the input string. It also calls the `buildLCP0` method to generate the longest common prefix (LCP) array based on the suffix array.

After that, it initializes an array `imos` with the length of the input string plus one. It then iterates over the LCP array and increments the value at the corresponding index in the `imos` array. This step is used to count the number of occurrences of each LCP value.

Next, it performs a cumulative sum on the `imos` array to calculate the number of LCP values that are greater than or equal to each index.

Finally, it iterates over the `imos` array and finds the maximum value of `imos[i] - i`, which represents the maximum number of repeated characters in a substring of the input string.

The maximum value is then printed as the output.
