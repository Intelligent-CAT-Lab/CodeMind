<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string from the input. Then it calls the `suffixArray` method from the `SuffixArray` class to generate the suffix array of the input string. It also calls the `buildLCP0` method to generate the longest common prefix (LCP) array based on the suffix array. 

After that, it initializes an array `imos` with length `n+1`, where `n` is the length of the input string. It then iterates over the LCP array and increments the corresponding index in `imos` by 1. 

Next, it performs a cumulative sum on the `imos` array, so that each element represents the number of suffixes with LCP greater than or equal to the index. 

Finally, it iterates over the `imos` array and finds the maximum value of `imos[i] - i`, where `i` is the index. This value represents the maximum number of repeated characters in a substring of the input string.

The code then prints the maximum value as the output.
