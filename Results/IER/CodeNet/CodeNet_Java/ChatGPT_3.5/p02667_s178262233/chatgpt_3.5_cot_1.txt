<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes variables tot, par, ones, and ans. The variable tot is set to 0, par is initialized as a boolean array with the length of the character array, ones is set to 0, and ans is set to 0.

The code then iterates through the character array and performs the following operations:
- Increments ans by i/2 + 1, where i is the current index.
- If the current character is '0', it sets the value of par at index tot to ones % 2 == 1. It then increments tot by 1.
- If the current character is '1', it increments ones by 1.

After the loop, the code initializes the arrays nextPar and minus with lengths tot + 1. It then calls the calc method with arguments 0 and false.

The calc method is a recursive method that takes two arguments: pos and inv. It checks if pos is equal to tot. If it is, the method returns. If par at index pos is not equal to inv, it calls calc with arguments pos + 1 and the negation of inv. It then sets minus at index pos to minus at index pos + 1 and nextPar at index pos to nextPar at index pos + 1 + 1. If par at index pos is equal to inv, it calls calc with arguments pos + 1 and inv. It then sets minus at index pos to minus at index pos + 1 + nextPar at index pos + 1 + 1 and nextPar at index pos to tot - pos - 1 - nextPar at index pos + 1.

Finally, the code prints ans minus minus at index 0.
