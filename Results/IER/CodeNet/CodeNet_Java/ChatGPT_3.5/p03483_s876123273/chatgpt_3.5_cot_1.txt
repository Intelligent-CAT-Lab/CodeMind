<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and performs several operations on it to calculate a value called "ret". 
First, it initializes an array "cnt" of size 26 to store the count of each character in the input string. 
Then, it iterates over the characters of the input string and updates the count of each character in the "cnt" array. 
Next, it checks if there is more than one character with an odd count in the "cnt" array. If there is, or if the length of the input string is even, it prints -1 and returns. 
Otherwise, it creates a 2D array "b" to store the indices of each character in the input string. 
Then, it iterates over the characters of the input string again and assigns indices to the corresponding character in the "b" array. 
After that, it initializes an array "a" of the same length as the input string to store the final indices of each character. 
It then iterates over the characters of the input string once more and assigns indices to the characters in the "a" array based on the conditions specified in the code. 
Finally, it calculates the value of "ret" using the "bubbleCount" method and prints it as the output.
