<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer N from the input. It then initializes an array called "table" with size N+1 and sets the first element to 0. It also initializes an integer variable M to 0.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to N. In each iteration, it calculates the value of table[i] by adding i to the previous element in the table. If the value of table[i] is greater than or equal to N, it sets M to i and breaks out of the loop.
After that, it creates a HashSet called "s" and adds integers from 1 to M to the set.
Then it removes the element (table[M]-N) from the set.
Finally, it prints each element in the set on a new line.
