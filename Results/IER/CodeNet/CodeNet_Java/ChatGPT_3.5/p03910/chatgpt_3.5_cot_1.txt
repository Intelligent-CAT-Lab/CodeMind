<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer N from the input. It initializes an array called table with size N+1 and sets the first element to 0. It also initializes an integer variable M to 0.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to N. In each iteration, it calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to i and stores it in the table array. If the sum is greater than or equal to N, it sets M to i and breaks out of the loop.
Next, it creates a HashSet called s and adds all integers from 1 to M to the set.
Then it removes the element (table[M]-N) from the set.
Finally, it prints all the elements in the set.

In this case, N is 4. The table array will be [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]. M will be 3. The set s will contain the integers 1, 2, and 3. The element (table[M]-N) is 6-4 = 2, so it will be removed from the set. The remaining elements in the set are 1 and 3.
