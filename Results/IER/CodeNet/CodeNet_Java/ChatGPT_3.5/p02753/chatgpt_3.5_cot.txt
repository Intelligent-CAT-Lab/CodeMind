<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input S. It checks if the first character of S is equal to the second character and if the second character is equal to the third character. If both conditions are true, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, the input string is "ABA". The first character 'A' is not equal to the second character 'B', so the condition is false. Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
