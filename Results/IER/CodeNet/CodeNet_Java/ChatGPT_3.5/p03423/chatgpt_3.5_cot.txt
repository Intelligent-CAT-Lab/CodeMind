<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single integer from the input and stores it in the variable `l`. Then, it creates a `StringTokenizer` object `st` to tokenize the string `l`. 
Next, it uses `st.nextToken()` to get the next token (which is the integer value) and converts it to an integer using `Integer.parseInt()`. 
The code then divides the parsed integer by 3 and takes the floor value using `Math.floor()`. The result is stored in the variable `answer`. 
Finally, it prints the value of `answer` as the output.
In this case, the input is `8`, so the code will divide `8` by `3` and take the floor value, which is `2`. Therefore, the output will be `2`.
