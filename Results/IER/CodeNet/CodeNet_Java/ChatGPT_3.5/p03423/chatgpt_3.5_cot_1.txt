<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single integer from the input and stores it in variable l. Then it uses the StringTokenizer class to tokenize the string l and extract the integer value from it. The extracted integer is divided by 3 and the result is rounded down to the nearest integer using the Math.floor() method. The final result is stored in the variable answer. Finally, the value of answer is printed as the output.

In this case, the input is "8". The code will extract the integer 8 from the input, divide it by 3 (which is 2.6666...), and round it down to the nearest integer, which is 2. Therefore, the output will be 2.
