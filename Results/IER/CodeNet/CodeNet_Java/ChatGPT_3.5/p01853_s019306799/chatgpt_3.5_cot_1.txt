<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It checks if n is odd or even. Since n is odd, it enters the if block.
It calculates the values of fst and snd. fst is n/2 + 1 = 3/2 + 1 = 2 and snd is n/2 = 3/2 = 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to fst-1 = 2-1 = 1. In the first iteration, it prints 0. In the second iteration, it prints 0.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to snd-1 = 1-1 = 0. Since the condition is not met, it does not enter the loop.
It prints a new line.
