<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 3 and variable y is initialized with 3 according to the input. The variable mod is initialized with 1000000007.
It checks if the sum of x and y is divisible by 3. If it is not, it prints 0 and returns.
Then it calculates the value of variable n as the sum of x and y divided by 3. It updates the values of x and y by subtracting n from them.
If either x or y becomes negative, it prints 0 and returns.
Finally, it calls the modCombination method passing x+y, x and mod as arguments. The method calculates the combination of x+y choose x modulo mod and returns the result.
The result is then printed as the output.
