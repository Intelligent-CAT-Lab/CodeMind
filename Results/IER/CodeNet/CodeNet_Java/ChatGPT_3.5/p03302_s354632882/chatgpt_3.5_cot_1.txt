<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the input. It then checks if the sum of a and b is equal to 15. If it is, it prints "+". If not, it checks if the product of a and b is equal to 15. If it is, it prints "*". Otherwise, it prints "x".
In this case, a is 4 and b is 11. The sum of a and b is not equal to 15 and the product of a and b is not equal to 15. Therefore, the code will print "x".
<<<Output>>>
x
