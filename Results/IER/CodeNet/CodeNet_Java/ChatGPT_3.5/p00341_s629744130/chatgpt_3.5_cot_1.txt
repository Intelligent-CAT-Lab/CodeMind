<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array t with size 12 and assigns the input values to the elements of the array using a for loop. The input values are 1, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 7, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5.
Then, it sorts the array t in descending order using bubble sort algorithm.
After sorting, it checks if the first 4 elements of the array are equal to each other and the next 8 elements of the array are equal to each other. If this condition is true, it prints "yes", otherwise it prints "no".
In this case, the first 4 elements are 9, 8, 7, 5 and the next 8 elements are 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 1. So, the condition is not true and it will print "no".
<<<Output>>>
no
