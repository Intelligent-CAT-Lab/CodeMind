The variable n is initialized with 2, and variables d1 and d2 are initialized with 1 and 2 respectively according to the input. The variable map is initialized as a 2D array of size 2n x 2n, and the variable sqrToseed is initialized as an empty HashMap.
The code then iterates through all possible values of i from 0 to sqrt(200000), and for each value, it checks if the difference between d1 and i^2 is present in the sqrToseed map. If it is, it adds the pair (i, sqrToseed.get(d1 - i^2)) to the d1xy list. It does the same for d2 and adds the pair (i, sqrToseed.get(d2 - i^2)) to the d2xy list.
Next, it calls the dfs function twice. The first time, it passes the d1xy list as the xy parameter, and the second time, it passes the d2xy list. The dfs function is a recursive function that takes in the current coordinates (y, x), the current color c, a boolean flag first, and the xy list. 
Inside the dfs function, it first checks if the current coordinates are out of bounds. If they are, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. 
If the first flag is true, it sets the value of map[y][x] to c%2+1. Otherwise, it sets the value of map[y][x] to map[y][x]*2 + c%2+1.
Then, it iterates through the xy list and for each pair (yy, xx), it calculates the new coordinates (yyy, xxx) by adding the corresponding values from the dx and dy arrays. If the new coordinates are out of bounds, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If the first flag is true, it checks if the value of map[yyy][xxx] is greater than 0. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, it calls the dfs function recursively with the new coordinates (yyy, xxx), the updated color (c+1)%2, the first flag set to false, and the xy list.
If the first flag is false, it checks if the value of map[yyy][xxx] is greater than 2. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, it calls the dfs function recursively with the new coordinates (yyy, xxx), the updated color (c+1)%2, the first flag set to false, and the xy list.
After the dfs function calls, the code checks if there is a value of k from 3 to 6 such that the count of cells with value k is greater than or equal to n^2. If there is, it prints the coordinates of the cells with value k until the count reaches n^2.
