<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 16 according to the input. And variable x is initialized with the remainder of n divided by 10, which is 6.
It checks the value of variable x and prints "hon" if x is 2, 4, 5, 7 or 9. In this case, x is 6, so it doesn't print "hon".
Then it checks if x is 0, 1, 6 or 8 and prints "pon" if it is. In this case, x is 6, so it prints "pon".
Therefore, the output would be "pon".
<<<Output>>>
