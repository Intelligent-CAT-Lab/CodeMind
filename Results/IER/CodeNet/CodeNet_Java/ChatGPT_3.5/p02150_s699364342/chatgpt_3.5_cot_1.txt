<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: a, b, and x.
It checks if x is greater than or equal to a. If it is, it calculates the value of the variable figure as (x-a)/(a-b)+1. 
Then it calculates the value of the variable count as x%1000000007+(figure%1000000007)*(b%1000000007).
Finally, it prints the value of count%1000000007 as the output.
In this case, x is 5 which is greater than a (3). So, it calculates figure as (5-3)/(3-1)+1 = 3.
Then it calculates count as 5%1000000007 + (3%1000000007)*(1%1000000007) = 5 + 3*1 = 8.
Finally, it prints 8%1000000007 = 8 as the output.
<<<Output>>>
8
