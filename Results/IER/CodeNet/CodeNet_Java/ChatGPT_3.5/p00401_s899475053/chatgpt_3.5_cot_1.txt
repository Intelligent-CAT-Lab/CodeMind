<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable `n`. It then uses the `Integer.highestOneBit()` method to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. The result is printed using `System.out.printf()`.

In this case, the input is 54. The highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 54 is 32 (2^5). Therefore, the output will be 32.

<<<Output>>>
32
