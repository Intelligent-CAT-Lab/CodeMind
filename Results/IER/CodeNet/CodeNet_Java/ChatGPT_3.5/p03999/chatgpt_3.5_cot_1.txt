<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` and initializes a variable `ans` with 0. It then enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates over the variable `dx` from 0 to the length of `s` minus 1. The inner loop iterates over the variable `start` from 0 to the length of `s` minus 1 minus `dx`. 

Inside the inner loop, it extracts a substring from `s` starting at index `start` and ending at index `start+dx+1`. It then converts this substring to a long integer using `Long.parseLong()`. This long integer is stored in the variable `cur`. 

The code then calculates the product of `cur` with the result of the `helper()` method called with the arguments `start` and `s.length()-1-dx-start`. The `helper()` method returns `1<<(n-1)`, where `n` is the input argument. 

The result of this product is added to the variable `ans`. 

After the nested loops finish, the final value of `ans` is printed as the output.

In this case, the input string is "125". The outer loop iterates once with `dx` equal to 0. The inner loop iterates three times with `start` equal to 0, 1, and 2. 

In the first iteration of the inner loop, the substring "1" is converted to the long integer 1. The product of 1 with `helper(0)*helper(2)` is 1. 

In the second iteration, the substring "2" is converted to the long integer 2. The product of 2 with `helper(1)*helper(1)` is 2. 

In the third iteration, the substring "5" is converted to the long integer 5. The product of 5 with `helper(2)*helper(0)` is 5. 

The final value of `ans` is 1+2+5 = 8.
