The variable n is initialized with the value 67 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It checks if the value of n falls within the range ['a', 'z']. Since 67 is not within this range, the condition is false.
Then it checks if the value of n falls within the range ['A', 'Z']. Since 67 is not within this range either, the condition is false.
Since both conditions are false, the value of ans remains 0.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 0.
