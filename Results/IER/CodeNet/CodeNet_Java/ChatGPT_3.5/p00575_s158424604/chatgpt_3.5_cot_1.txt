<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and goal. It initializes day as 1 and coin as 0.
Then it enters a while loop which continues until the value of coin is greater than or equal to goal.
Inside the loop, it adds the value of a to coin and checks if the current day is a multiple of 7. If it is, it adds the value of b to coin.
After each iteration of the loop, it increments the value of day by 1.
Once the value of coin becomes greater than or equal to goal, the loop terminates.
Finally, it prints the value of day-1 as the output.
In this case, the value of a is 3, b is 0, and goal is 10.
On the first day, coin becomes 3. On the second day, coin becomes 6. On the third day, coin becomes 9. On the fourth day, coin becomes 12, which is greater than goal.
Therefore, the output of the code would be 4.
