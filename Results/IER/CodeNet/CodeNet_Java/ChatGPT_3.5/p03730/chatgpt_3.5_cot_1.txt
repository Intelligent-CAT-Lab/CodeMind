<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 4999. Inside the loop, it checks if the product of a and i modulo b is equal to c. If the condition is true, it prints "YES" and returns from the main method. If the loop finishes without finding a match, it prints "NO".
In this case, the values of a, b, and c are 7, 5, and 1 respectively. The loop iterates from 0 to 4999 and checks if 7 * i % 5 is equal to 1. The first value of i that satisfies this condition is 3, because 7 * 3 % 5 = 1. Therefore, the output of the code execution would be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
