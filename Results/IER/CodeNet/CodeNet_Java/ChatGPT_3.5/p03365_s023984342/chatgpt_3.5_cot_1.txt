<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0, mod is initialized with 1000000007 and fact is initialized with the result of the getFact() method.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from n-1 to n-1-i, where i is initialized with n-1. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of ans by performing several calculations using the modcomb() method and the values from the fact array.
After the loop finishes, it performs some final calculations on the value of ans and prints the final result as output.
