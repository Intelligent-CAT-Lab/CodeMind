<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three long integers N, A, and B from the input. It then checks if the difference between B and A is even. If it is, it prints (B - A) / 2. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum value between A - 1 and N - B, adds 1 to it, and then adds (B - A) / 2. The final result is printed as the output.
In this case, N = 5, A = 2, and B = 4. The difference between B and A is 2, which is even. So the output will be (4 - 2) / 2 = 1.
