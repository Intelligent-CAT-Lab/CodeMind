<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then iterates over each character in the array. If the character is '+', it increments the variable num by 1. If the character is '-', it decrements the variable num by 1. After iterating over all the characters, it prints the final value of num as the output.
In this case, the input string is "+-++". The code will iterate over each character and increment num by 1 for the first '+', decrement num by 1 for the '-', and increment num by 1 for the remaining two '+'. Therefore, the final value of num will be 2.
<<<Output>>>
