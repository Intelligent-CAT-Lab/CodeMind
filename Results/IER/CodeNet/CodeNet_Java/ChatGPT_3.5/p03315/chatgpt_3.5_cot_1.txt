<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then iterates over each character in the array. If the character is '+', it increments the variable num by 1. If the character is '-', it decrements the variable num by 1. After iterating over all the characters, it prints the final value of num as the output.

In this case, the input string is "+-++". The code will iterate over each character in the string. The first character is '+', so num will be incremented by 1. The second character is '-', so num will be decremented by 1. The third character is '+', so num will be incremented by 1. The fourth character is '+', so num will be incremented by 1. After iterating over all the characters, the final value of num will be 2.
