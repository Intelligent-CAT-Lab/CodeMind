<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It checks if k is even or odd. In this case, k is even.
If k is even, it calculates ans as (n / k) * (n / k) * (n / k), which is (3 / 2) * (3 / 2) * (3 / 2) = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.
Then it adds k / 2 to n, which is 2 / 2 = 1. So n becomes 4.
Then it calculates ans as (n / k) * (n / k) * (n / k), which is (4 / 2) * (4 / 2) * (4 / 2) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.
So the final value of ans is 1 + 8 = 9.
After the calculations, it prints the final value of ans as output, which is 9.
