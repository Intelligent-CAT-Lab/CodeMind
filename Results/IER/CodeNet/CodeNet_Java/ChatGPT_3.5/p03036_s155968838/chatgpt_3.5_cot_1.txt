<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: r, d, and the first element of the array ary. The values of r, d, and ary[0] are initialized with 2, 10, and 20 respectively according to the input.
Then, a for loop is used to iterate from 0 to 9. In each iteration, the value of ary[i+1] is calculated by multiplying ary[i] with r and subtracting d from it. The calculated value is then printed.
The loop runs 10 times, so it will print 10 values of ary[i+1].
