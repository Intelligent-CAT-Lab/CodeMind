<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two BigInteger values from the input using the Scanner class. It subtracts the second BigInteger value from the first BigInteger value and prints the result.
In this case, the first BigInteger value is 5 and the second BigInteger value is 8. So, the code will subtract 8 from 5, resulting in -3.
<<<Output>>>
-3
