<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 5, 1, 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable diff is initialized with the absolute difference between a and b. The variable isOK is initialized with false.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-2 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it calculates two values dw and up based on the current value of i and the values of c and d. 
Then it checks if the calculated values dw and up can cover the difference between a and b. If it does, it sets the variable isOK to true and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints "YES" if isOK is true, otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES
