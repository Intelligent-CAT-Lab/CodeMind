<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input. And variables odd and notOdd are initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is odd or not by checking if i % 2 == 0. If it is odd, it increments the value of variable odd by 1. Otherwise, it increments the value of variable notOdd by 1.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the ratio of odd numbers to the total numbers by dividing the value of variable odd by the value of variable n. The result is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
