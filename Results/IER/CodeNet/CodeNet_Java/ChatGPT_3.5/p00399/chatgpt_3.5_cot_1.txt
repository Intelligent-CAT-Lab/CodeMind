<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings using the space as a delimiter. The input "4 2 1 1" will be split into ["4", "2", "1", "1"].
Then, it iterates over each element in the array and converts it to an integer using Integer.parseInt(). The integers are then added to the variable "result".
Finally, the value of "result" is printed as the output, which is the sum of all the integers in the input array: 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
