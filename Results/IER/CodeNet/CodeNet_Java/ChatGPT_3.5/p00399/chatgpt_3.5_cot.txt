<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings using the space as a delimiter. The input "4 2 1 1" will be split into an array ["4", "2", "1", "1"].
Then, it iterates over each element in the array and converts it to an integer using the Integer.parseInt() method. The converted integers are then added to the variable "result".
Finally, the value of "result" is printed as the output, which will be the sum of the integers in the input array: 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
