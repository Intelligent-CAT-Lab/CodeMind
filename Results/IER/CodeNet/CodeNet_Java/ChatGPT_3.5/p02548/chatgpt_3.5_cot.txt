<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` from the user.
It initializes a BigInteger variable `cnt` with zero.
Then it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 1 to `n` and the inner loop also iterates from 1 to `n`.
Inside the inner loop, it checks if the product of `i` and `j` is less than `n`. If it is, it increments the value of `cnt` by 1 using the `add` method of BigInteger.
If the condition is not met, it breaks out of the inner loop.
After both loops finish, it prints the value of `cnt` as the output.
