<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable cnt is initialized with 0.
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 for both variables i and j.
Inside the nested for loop, it checks if the product of i and j is less than n. If it is, it increments the value of variable cnt by 1.
If the condition is not met, it breaks out of the inner loop.
After the loops finish, it prints the final value of variable cnt as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
