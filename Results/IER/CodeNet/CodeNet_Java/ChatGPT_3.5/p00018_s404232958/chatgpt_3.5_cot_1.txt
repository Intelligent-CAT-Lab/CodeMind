<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array of size 5 called nums. It then takes input from the user and stores it in the array nums. The input values are 3, 6, 9, 7, and 5. 
The code then sorts the array nums in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method. 
Finally, the code prints the elements of the sorted array nums in reverse order, separated by a space. The output will be 9 7 6 5 3.
<<<Output>>>
9 7 6 5 3
