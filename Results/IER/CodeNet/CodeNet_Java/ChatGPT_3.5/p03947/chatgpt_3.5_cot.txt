<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then initializes a variable `current_char` with the first character of the array and a variable `count` with 0. 

It then iterates through the character array starting from the second character. If the current character is different from the `current_char` variable, it increments the `count` variable and updates the `current_char` variable to the current character. 

After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of the `count` variable as the output.

In this case, the input string is "BBBWW". The code will iterate through the characters and count the number of times the character changes. In this case, the character changes from 'B' to 'W' once, so the output will be 1.
