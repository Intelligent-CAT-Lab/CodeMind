<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then initializes a variable `current_char` with the first character of the array and a variable `count` with 0. 

It then iterates through the character array starting from the second character. For each character, it checks if it is different from the `current_char`. If it is, it increments the `count` variable and updates the `current_char` to the current character. 

After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of `count` as the output. 

In this case, the input string is "BBBWW". The first character is 'B'. The loop iterates through the remaining characters and finds that the second character is the same as the first character ('B'), so it does not increment the `count`. The third character is also the same ('B'), so it does not increment the `count` again. The fourth character is different from the previous one ('W'), so it increments the `count` to 1. The fifth character is the same as the previous one ('W'), so it does not increment the `count`. 

Therefore, the final value of `count` is 1.
