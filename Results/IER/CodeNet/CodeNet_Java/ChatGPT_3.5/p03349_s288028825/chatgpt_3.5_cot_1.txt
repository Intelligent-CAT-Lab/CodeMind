<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers n, k, and MOD from the input. The values of n, k, and MOD are 2, 2, and 100 respectively according to the input.
Then it initializes a 2D array numberOfSequencesOfSizeIwithElementBiggerThenJ with size 301x301, and another 2D array sumValue with the same size.
It also initializes another 2D array nChK with size 301x301 by calling the preComputeNChooseK_MOD_Mod method from the MathExtentions class.
Then it enters a for loop and initializes some values in the numberOfSequencesOfSizeIwithElementBiggerThenJ and sumValue arrays.
After that, it enters another nested for loop and calculates the values for the numberOfSequencesOfSizeIwithElementBiggerThenJ and sumValue arrays.
Finally, it prints the value of numberOfSequencesOfSizeIwithElementBiggerThenJ[n][0] as the output, which is 1.
