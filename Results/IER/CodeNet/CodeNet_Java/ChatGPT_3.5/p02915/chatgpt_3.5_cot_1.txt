<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the console. It then reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable S. 
Next, it calculates the cube of S by multiplying it with itself twice and assigns the result to the variable ans. 
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the input value is 2. So, the code will calculate 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 and print 8 as the output.
<<<Output>>>
8
