<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using BufferedReader and StringTokenizer. It reads a line of input and splits it into three integers: k1[0], k1[1], and k1[2]. 
Then it calculates the difference between k1[2] and k1[0] and stores it in the variable kariiregaku. If kariiregaku is negative, it is set to 0.
Then it checks if k1[1] is greater than or equal to kariiregaku. If it is, it prints the value of kariiregaku. Otherwise, it prints "NA".
The code continues to read input and perform the same calculations and checks until there is no more input.
In this case, the input is "1000 3000 3000". After splitting the input, k1[0] will be 1000, k1[1] will be 3000, and k1[2] will be 3000.
The difference between k1[2] and k1[0] is 2000. Since k1[1] (3000) is greater than or equal to kariiregaku (2000), the code will print 2000 as the output.
<<<Output>>>
2000
