<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input using the Scanner class. The first integer is multiplied by 0, which results in 0. Then, the second and third integers are added to the result. Finally, the result is checked if it is even or odd using the modulo operator (%). If the result is even, the code prints "Alice", otherwise it prints "Borys".

In this case, the input is 5, 2, and 4. So, the calculation would be (5 * 0 + 2 + 4) % 2. This simplifies to (0 + 2 + 4) % 2, which is 6 % 2. The modulo operation gives the remainder when 6 is divided by 2, which is 0. Since the result is 0, the code will print "Alice".

<<<Output>>>
Alice
