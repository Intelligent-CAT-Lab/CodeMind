The variable N is initialized with 24 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0, variable q is initialized with 2 and variable e is initialized with 1. The variable div is also initialized.
It enters a while loop with condition true. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of div as q raised to the power of e. If N is divisible by div, it divides N by div, increments ans by 1 and increments e by 1. Then it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If N is not divisible by div, it enters another while loop and divides N by q repeatedly until N is not divisible by q anymore.
After that, it checks if q is equal to 2. If it is, it increments q by 1. Otherwise, it increments q by 2.
It sets e back to 1 and checks if q multiplied by q is greater than N. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it checks if N is not equal to 1. If it is not, it increments ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output, which is 3.
