<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string from the input and splits it into individual characters. It then adds these characters to a HashSet to remove any duplicates. If the size of the input string is equal to the size of the HashSet, it means that there are no duplicate characters in the string. In this case, the value of `ans` is set to "yes". Otherwise, it remains "no". Finally, the value of `ans` is printed as the output.

In this case, the input string is "uncopyrightable". After splitting it into individual characters, we get the following list: ["u", "n", "c", "o", "p", "y", "r", "i", "g", "h", "t", "a", "b", "l", "e"]. There are no duplicate characters in this list, so the value of `ans` will be "yes".

<<<Output>>>
yes
