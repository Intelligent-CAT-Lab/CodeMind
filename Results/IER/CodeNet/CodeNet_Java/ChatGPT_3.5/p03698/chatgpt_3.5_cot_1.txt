<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and splits it into individual characters. It then adds these characters to a HashSet, which automatically removes any duplicates. After that, it checks if the size of the input string is equal to the size of the HashSet. If they are equal, it means that there are no duplicate characters in the input string, so it sets the answer variable to "yes". Otherwise, it remains "no". Finally, it prints the value of the answer variable.

In this case, the input string is "uncopyrightable". After splitting it into individual characters, the HashSet will contain all the unique characters in the string. Since the size of the input string is equal to the size of the HashSet (13), the answer variable will be set to "yes". Therefore, the output will be "yes".

<<<Output>>>
yes
