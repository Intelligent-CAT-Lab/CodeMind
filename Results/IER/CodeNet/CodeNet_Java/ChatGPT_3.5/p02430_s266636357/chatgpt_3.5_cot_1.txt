<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable pow is initialized with 2^n, which is 32 in this case.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 31 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable m.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the binary representation of the current integer m by repeatedly dividing m by 2 and storing the remainder in array a. It also counts the number of 1s in the binary representation using variable counter.
Then it checks if the number of 1s in the binary representation is equal to k. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If the number of 1s is equal to k, it prints the current integer i followed by the indices of the 1s in the binary representation.
After the loop finishes, the program ends.
