<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h, variable w, variable a and variable b are initialized with 2, 3, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input. 
It creates an instance of the ModComb class and calls the makeFac() method to initialize the fac and inv arrays.
Then it initializes a ModInt variable res with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to h-a-1 (1 iteration in this case) and assigns the value of i to a ModInt variable res.
Inside the loop, it calculates the combination of (b-1+i, i) and (w-b-1+h-1-i, h-1-i) using the combFac() method of the ModComb class and multiplies them together.
Then it adds the result to the variable res.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable res as output.
