<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: h, w, a, and b. It then initializes a ModComb object and calls the makeFac() method to calculate the factorial and inverse factorial values. 
Next, it initializes a ModInt object called res with a value of 0. 
Then, it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to h - a. Inside the loop, it calculates the combination of (b - 1 + i, i) and (w - b - 1 + h - 1 - i, h - 1 - i) using the combFac() method of the ModComb object. It multiplies the two combinations and adds the result to the res object. 
Finally, it prints the value of res as the output.
