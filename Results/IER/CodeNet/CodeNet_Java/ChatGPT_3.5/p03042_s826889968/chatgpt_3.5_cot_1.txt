<<<Analysis>>>
The variable number_input is initialized with 1905 according to the input. Then it calculates the value of variable number_upper by dividing number_input by 100 and the value of variable number_lower by taking the modulo of number_input by 100.
Then it checks if both number_upper and number_lower fall within the range [1, 12]. If they do, it prints "AMBIGUOUS".
If only number_upper falls within the range [1, 12], it prints "MMYY".
If only number_lower falls within the range [1, 12], it prints "YYMM".
If neither number_upper nor number_lower falls within the range [1, 12], it prints "NA".
In this case, number_upper is 19 and number_lower is 5, so it falls into the last else condition and it prints "NA".
<<<Output>>>
NA
