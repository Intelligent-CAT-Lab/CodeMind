<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input using the Scanner class and stores it in variable r. Then it calculates the square root of r using the Math.sqrt() method and casts it to an integer. Finally, it multiplies the result by itself and prints the output.
In this case, the input is 10. The square root of 10 is approximately 3.162, and when it is cast to an integer, it becomes 3. Multiplying 3 by itself gives the output 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
