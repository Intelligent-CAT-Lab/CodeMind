<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable `r`. Then it calculates the square root of `r` using the Math.sqrt() method and casts it to an integer. Finally, it multiplies the calculated square root by itself and prints the result.

In this case, the input is 10. The square root of 10 is approximately 3.1622776601683795. When this value is cast to an integer, it becomes 3. Therefore, the output of the code would be 3 * 3, which is 9.

<<<Output>>>
9
