<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and initializes a 4-dimensional array `dp` with dimensions `n+1`, 5, 5, and 5. The purpose of this array is to store the number of valid sequences of length `n` with the characters A, G, C, and T.

The code then sets the initial value of `dp[0][0][0][0]` to 1, indicating that there is 1 valid sequence of length 0.

Next, the code enters a nested loop that iterates over the indices of the `dp` array. For each index `(i, j, k, l)`, the code checks if the current character `m` (ranging from 1 to 4) can be added to the sequence without violating the constraints. If the constraints are satisfied, the code updates `dp[i][k][l][m]` by adding the value of `dp[i-1][j][k][l]` modulo `mod`.

After the nested loop finishes, the code calculates the final answer by summing up all the values in the `dp[n]` array modulo `mod`.

Finally, the code prints the final answer as the output.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of `3` would be 61.
