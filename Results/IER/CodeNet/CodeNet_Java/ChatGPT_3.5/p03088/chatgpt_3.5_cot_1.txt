The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. The variable mod is initialized with 1000000007.
A 4-dimensional array dp is created with dimensions [n+1][5][5][5].
The value of dp[0][0][0][0] is set to 1.
Then, a nested for loop is used to iterate through the dimensions of the dp array.
Inside the loop, there are several if conditions to check certain combinations of values for j, k, l, and m. If any of these conditions are met, the loop continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, the value of dp[i][k][l][m] is updated by adding the value of dp[i-1][j][k][l] modulo mod.
After the loop finishes, another nested for loop is used to calculate the final answer by summing up all the values in the dp array for the last dimension.
The final answer is printed as the output.
