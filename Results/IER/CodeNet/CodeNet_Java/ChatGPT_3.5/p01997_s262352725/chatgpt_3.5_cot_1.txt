<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers A and B from the input. Then it calculates the volume of a sphere using the formula V = (4/3) * π * r^3, where r is the value of B. The calculated volume is printed with 10 decimal places.
In this case, the input is "1 2". The code reads A=1 and B=2. Then it calculates the volume as (4/3) * π * 2^3 = 33.5103216383. The output is printed as 33.5103216383.
<<<Output>>>
33.5103216383
