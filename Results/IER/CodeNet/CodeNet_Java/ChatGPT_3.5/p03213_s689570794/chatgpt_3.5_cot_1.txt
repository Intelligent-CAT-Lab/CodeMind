The variable N is initialized with 9 according to the input. An array named primaryNumbers is initialized with some prime numbers.
A map named map is initialized to store the count of prime factors of N. A variable count is initialized to count the number of combinations.
The code then enters a for loop to iterate through each prime number in the primaryNumbers array. Inside the loop, it calculates the count of the current prime number in the prime factorization of N and stores it in the map.
Then it enters another for loop to check for combinations of i, j, and k where i and j are raised to the power of 4 and k is raised to the power of 2. It breaks the loop if the count of any prime number is less than 4.
Inside the loop, it checks if i, j, and k are not equal and increments the count variable if the condition is met.
After that, it enters another for loop to check for combinations of i and j where i is raised to the power of 24 and j is raised to the power of 2. It breaks the loop if the count of any prime number is less than 24.
Inside the loop, it checks if i and j are not equal and increments the count variable if the condition is met.
Then it enters another for loop to check for combinations of i and j where i is raised to the power of 14 and j is raised to the power of 4. It breaks the loop if the count of any prime number is less than 14.
Inside the loop, it checks if i and j are not equal and increments the count variable if the condition is met.
Finally, it enters another for loop to check for combinations of i where i is raised to the power of 74. It breaks the loop if the count of any prime number is less than 74.
Inside the loop, it increments the count variable.
After all the loops, it prints the final value of the count variable as output.
