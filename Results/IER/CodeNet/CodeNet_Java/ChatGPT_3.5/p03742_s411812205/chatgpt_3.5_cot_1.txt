<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers x and y as input. It checks the value of y against different conditions to determine the value of the variable ans.
If y is between 0 and x-2 (inclusive), ans is set to 1.
If y is between x-1 and x+1 (inclusive), ans is set to 0.
If y is greater than or equal to x+2, ans is set to 1.
Finally, it prints "Alice" if ans is 1, otherwise it prints "Brown".
In this case, x=2 and y=1. Since y is between x-1 and x+1, ans is set to 0. Therefore, the output will be "Brown".
<<<Output>>>
Brown
