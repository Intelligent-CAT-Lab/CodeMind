<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using the Scanner class. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as there is more input to read. Inside the loop, it reads a line of input and assigns it to the variable "str". It then replaces all occurrences of '.' with ',' and ',' with ' ' in the string. After that, it splits the string into an array of tokens using the space character as the delimiter.

Next, it initializes a variable "count" to 0. It then iterates over each token in the array. For each token, it calculates the length of the token and assigns it to the variable "n". If the length of the token is between 3 and 6 (inclusive), it enters an if statement. Inside the if statement, it checks if "count" is greater than 0. If it is, it prints a space character. Then it prints the substring of the token from index 0 to index "n" (exclusive). It then increments "count" by 1.

After the loop finishes, it checks if "count" is greater than 0. If it is, it prints a new line character.
