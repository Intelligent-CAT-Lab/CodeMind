<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using a Scanner object. It then enters a while loop that continues until there is no more input. Inside the loop, it reads a line of input and stores it in the variable str. It then replaces all occurrences of '.' with ',' and ',' with ' ' in the string. After that, it splits the string into an array of tokens using space as the delimiter.

Next, it initializes a variable count to 0. It then iterates over each token in the array. For each token, it calculates the length of the token and stores it in the variable n. If the length of the token is between 3 and 6 (inclusive), it enters an if condition. Inside the if condition, it checks if count is greater than 0. If it is, it prints a space. Then it prints the substring of the token from index 0 to n (exclusive). After printing the token, it increments the count variable.

After the loop finishes, it checks if count is greater than 0. If it is, it prints a new line.
