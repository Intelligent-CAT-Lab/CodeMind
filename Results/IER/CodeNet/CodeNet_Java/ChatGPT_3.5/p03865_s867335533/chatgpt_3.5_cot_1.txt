<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and checks if the length of the string is even or odd. If it is even, it checks if the first character is equal to the last character. If it is, it prints "First", otherwise it prints "Second". If the length of the string is odd, it checks if the first character is equal to the last character. If it is, it prints "Second", otherwise it prints "First".

In this case, the input string is "aba". The length of the string is 3, which is odd. The first character 'a' is equal to the last character 'a'. Therefore, the output will be "Second".
