<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads an integer value from the user and assigns it to the variable age. 
Next, it checks if the value of age is equal to 3, 5, or 7. If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, the input value is 5. Since 5 is equal to one of the specified values (5), the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
