<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input values for M, rD, and rR. It then calculates the values of D0 and C0 using the formulas (100*cD+rD-1)/rD and (100*cR+rR-1)/rR respectively. 
Then it enters a nested for loop that iterates from 0 to 99. Inside the loop, it calculates the values of changeD and changeR by adding i and j respectively to D0 and C0. 
It then calculates the value of jpn by subtracting changeD and changeR from M. If jpn is negative, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. 
Otherwise, it calculates the values of remD and remR using the formulas changeD*rD/100-cD and changeR*rR/100-cR respectively. 
Finally, it calculates the value of jpn by adding remD*100/rD and remR*100/rR to jpn. It updates the value of max by taking the maximum of max and jpn. 
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of max as the output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `M r` would be the value of max after the loop finishes.
