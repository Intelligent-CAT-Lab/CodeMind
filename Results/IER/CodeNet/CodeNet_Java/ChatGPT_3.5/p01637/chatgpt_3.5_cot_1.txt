<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input values M, rD, rR, cD, and cR. It then calculates D0 and C0 using the formulas (100*cD+rD-1)/rD and (100*cR+rR-1)/rR respectively. 
Then it enters a nested for loop that iterates from 0 to 99. Inside the loop, it calculates the change in D and R values by adding i and j respectively to D0 and C0. 
It then calculates the remaining JPN value by subtracting the change in D and R values from M. If the JPN value is negative, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. 
Otherwise, it calculates the remaining D and R values by subtracting cD and cR respectively from the change in D and R values. 
It then calculates the JPN value by adding the remaining D and R values multiplied by 100 and divided by rD and rR respectively. 
Finally, it updates the maximum value by comparing it with the current JPN value. 
After the loop finishes, it prints the maximum value as the output.
