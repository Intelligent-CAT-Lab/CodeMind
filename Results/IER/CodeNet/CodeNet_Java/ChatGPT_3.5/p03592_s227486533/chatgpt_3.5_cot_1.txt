<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: n, m, and k. It then calls the solve() method passing these three integers as arguments.
Inside the solve() method, there are two nested for loops that iterate from 0 to n and 0 to m respectively. For each combination of p1 and q, it checks if the equation p1 * m + q * n - 2 * p1 * q is equal to k. If it is, then it returns true.
If the loops finish executing without finding a match, then it returns false.
Finally, the main method calls the solve() method and prints "Yes" if the solve() method returns true, and "No" otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
