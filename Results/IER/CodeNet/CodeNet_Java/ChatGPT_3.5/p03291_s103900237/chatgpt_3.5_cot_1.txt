<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and stores it in an array of characters called `s`. It then initializes several arrays (`a`, `c`, `da`, `dc`) to keep track of the number of occurrences of 'A', 'C', '?' before and after each index in the string. 

The code then calculates the number of valid substrings that can be formed using the characters 'A', 'B', 'C' or '?'. It does this by iterating through each index of the string and checking if the character at that index is 'B' or '?'. If it is, it calculates the number of valid substrings that can be formed by multiplying the number of 'A's before that index (`a[i]`) with the number of 'C's after that index (`c[i]`). It also takes into account the number of '?'s before and after that index (`da[i-1]` and `dc[i+1]`).

Finally, it prints the total number of valid substrings as the output.
