<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. Then it iterates over the first 3 characters of the array and checks if each character is equal to '1'. If it is, it replaces it with '9', otherwise it replaces it with '1'. Finally, it prints the modified character array as a string.
In this case, the input string is "119". The first character '1' is replaced with '9', the second character '1' is replaced with '9', and the third character '9' remains unchanged. So the modified character array is "999". When it is printed as a string, the output is "999".
<<<Output>>>
