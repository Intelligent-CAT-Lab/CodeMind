<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and variable y are initialized with 3 and 8 respectively according to the input. And variable flg is initialized with false.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable sum using the formula 2*i + 4*(x-i).
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to y. If it is, it sets the variable flg to true and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of variable flg. If it is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the value of variable sum is 0, 4, 8, and 12 for i = 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively. None of these values are equal to y = 8.
So the output would be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
