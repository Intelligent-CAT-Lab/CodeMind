<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input using the Scanner class and stores it in variable a. Then it checks if the value of a is greater than or equal to 1000. If it is, it prints "ABD", otherwise it prints "ABC".
In this case, the input value is 999, which is less than 1000. So the condition is not met and the code will print "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
