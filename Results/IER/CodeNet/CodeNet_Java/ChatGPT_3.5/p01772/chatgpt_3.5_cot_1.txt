<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and stores it in a character array called 'c'. It then initializes a StringBuilder called 's' to store the characters 'A' and 'Z' from the input string. It iterates through each character in the input string and if the character is 'A' or 'Z', it appends it to the StringBuilder 's'. 

Next, it converts the StringBuilder 's' to a character array and assigns it back to 'c'. It then initializes a new StringBuilder 's' to store the unique consecutive characters from 'c'. It iterates through each character in 'c' and if the current character is different from the last character in 's', it appends it to 's'.

After that, it checks if the first character of 's' is 'Z' and if it is, it deletes the first character. It then checks if the last character of 's' is 'A' and if it is, it deletes the last character.

Finally, it checks if 's' is not empty. If it is not empty, it prints 's'. Otherwise, it prints -1.
