<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and processes it character by character. It checks if the character is either 'A' or 'Z', and if it is, it appends it to a StringBuilder object called 's'. Then it converts the StringBuilder object to a string and assigns it back to 'c'. It then checks if the length of 's' is greater than 0 and if the last character of 's' is equal to the current character. If it is not, it appends the current character to 's'. After the loop finishes, it checks if the length of 's' is greater than 0 and if the first character of 's' is 'Z'. If it is, it deletes the first character of 's'. It then checks if the length of 's' is greater than 0 and if the last character of 's' is 'A'. If it is, it deletes the last character of 's'. Finally, it checks if the length of 's' is greater than 0. If it is, it prints 's'. Otherwise, it prints -1.
