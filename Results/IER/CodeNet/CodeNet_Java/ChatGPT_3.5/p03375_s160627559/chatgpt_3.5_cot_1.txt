The variable N is initialized with 2 and variable M is initialized with 1000000007 according to the input.
Then it initializes a 2D array comb with size [3001][3001] and a variable f with size [N+1][N+1].
It enters a nested for loop to calculate the values of f[i][j] for each i and j.
Inside the nested for loop, it calculates the value of f[i][j] using the formula f[i][j] = f[i-1][j] * (j+1) + (j-1 >= 0 ? f[i-1][j-1] : 0) and takes the modulo M.
Then it initializes another 2D array comb with size [3001][3001] and calculates the values of comb[i][j] for each i and j using the formula comb[i][j] = (j > 0 ? comb[i-1][j-1] : 0) + comb[i-1][j] and takes the modulo M.
After that, it initializes a variable ans with 0 and enters a for loop to calculate the value of ans.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of sum using the formula sum += f[i][k] * pow(2, (N-i)*k, M) % M for each k and takes the modulo M.
Then it calculates the value of ans using the formula ans += (i % 2 == 0 ? 1 : -1) * pow(2, pow(2, N-i, M-1), M) % M * sum % M * comb[N][i] % M and takes the modulo M.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
