<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers A, B, and K as input. It checks if K is less than or equal to A. If it is, it subtracts K from A. If K is greater than A but less than or equal to the sum of A and B, it subtracts K minus A from B and sets A to 0. If K is greater than the sum of A and B, it sets both A and B to 0. Finally, it prints the values of A and B.

In this case, A=2, B=3, and K=3. Since K is equal to A, A is subtracted by K, resulting in A=2-3=-1. Since A is negative, it means there is no remaining value for A, so B remains the same. Therefore, the output will be -1 3.
