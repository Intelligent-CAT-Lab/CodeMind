<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and performs multiple replacements using the `replaceAll()` method. It replaces the substrings "eraser", "erase", "dreamer", and "dream" with a hyphen ("-"). Then it removes all the hyphens from the string. After these replacements, if the length of the string is 0, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

In this case, the input string is "erasedream". The code replaces "erase" with a hyphen, resulting in "-dream". Then it replaces "dream" with a hyphen, resulting in "-". Finally, it removes the hyphen, resulting in an empty string. Since the length of the string is 0, the code prints "YES".

<<<Output>>>
YES
