<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S and performs multiple replacements using the `replaceAll()` method. It replaces the substrings "eraser", "erase", "dreamer", and "dream" with a hyphen "-". Then it removes all the hyphens from the string. Finally, it checks if the resulting string is empty or not. If it is empty, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

In the case of the input string "erasedream", the replacements will result in the string "-". After removing the hyphen, the resulting string is empty. Therefore, the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
