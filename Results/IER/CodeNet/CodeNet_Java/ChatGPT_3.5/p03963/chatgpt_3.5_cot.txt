<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, N and K. It initializes a variable ans with the value of K. Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to N. In each iteration, it multiplies the value of ans by K-1. After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as the output.

In this case, the input is "2 2". So, N=2 and K=2. The for loop will only run once because N=2. In the first iteration, ans will be multiplied by K-1, which is 2-1=1. So, the final value of ans will be 2*1=2.

<<<Output>>>
2
