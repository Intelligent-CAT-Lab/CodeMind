<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 and variable K is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with K.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to N. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of ans with K-1 and assigns the result back to ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output.
In this case, the loop runs only once because N is 2. So, ans is multiplied by K-1 once and the final value of ans is 2*(2-1) = 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
