<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and initializes an array `alp` of size 26 to store the count of each character in the string. It then iterates through each character in the string and increments the count of the corresponding character in the `alp` array. 

After counting the occurrences of each character, it checks how many characters have an odd count. It initializes a variable `oddNum` to 0 and increments it for each character in the `alp` array that has an odd count.

Finally, it prints the maximum of 0 and `oddNum/2` as the output.

In this case, the input string is "hcpc". The count of each character in the string is as follows:
- 'h' occurs 1 time
- 'c' occurs 2 times
- 'p' occurs 1 time

Therefore, there are 2 characters ('h' and 'p') with an odd count. So, `oddNum` is 2. The output is the maximum of 0 and 2/2, which is 1.
