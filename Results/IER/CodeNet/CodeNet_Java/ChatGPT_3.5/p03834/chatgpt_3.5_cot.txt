<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the user using BufferedReader and stores it in the variable 's'. 
Then it replaces all occurrences of ',' with a space ' ' in the string 's' using the replace() method.
Finally, it prints the modified string 's' as the output.
So, the return value of `happy,newyear,enjoy` would be `happy newyear enjoy`.
<<<Output>>>
happy newyear enjoy
