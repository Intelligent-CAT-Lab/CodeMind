<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the console. It then reads an integer value from the input using the `nextInt()` method and assigns it to the variable `n`. Finally, it prints the string "ABC" concatenated with the value of `n`.

In this case, the input value is 100. So, the code will assign 100 to `n` and print "ABC100" as the output.

<<<Output>>>
ABC100
