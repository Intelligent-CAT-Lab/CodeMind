The variable X is initialized with 103 and variable P is initialized with 100. The variable cnt is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it continues to execute the loop until the value of P becomes greater than or equal to X.
Inside the loop, it increases the value of P by adding P/100 to it. It also increments the value of cnt by 1 in each iteration.
The loop continues until P becomes greater than or equal to X. In this case, the loop executes 26 times.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of cnt as output, which is 26.
<<<Output>>>
26
