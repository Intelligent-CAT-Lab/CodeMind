<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer `n` from the input. It then initializes an empty set `ans` to store the coordinates of the checkerboard cells. 

The code then iterates over the odd indices from 1 to `n-1` and adds the coordinates (i, 0) and (0, i) to the set `ans`. This covers the first row and first column of the checkerboard.

Next, the code iterates over the even indices from `n%2` to `n-1` and adds the coordinates (i, n-1) and (n-1, i) to the set `ans`. This covers the last row and last column of the checkerboard.

The code then enters a loop that iterates 10 times. In each iteration, it adds the coordinates of the cells in a diagonal pattern. The offset and step size of the diagonal pattern are determined by the variables `offset` and `d`. The offset starts from 0 and increases by `d` in each iteration. The step size `d` doubles in each iteration.

Finally, the code prints the size of the set `ans` and then prints each coordinate in the set on a new line.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of `2` would be the number of coordinates in the set `ans`.
