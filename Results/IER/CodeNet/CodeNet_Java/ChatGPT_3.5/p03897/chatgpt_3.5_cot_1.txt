<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. A HashSet called ans is created to store the coordinates of the checkerboard. 
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 with a step of 2. In each iteration, it adds two coordinates (i, 0) and (0, i) to the ans set.
Then it enters another for loop that iterates from n%2 to n-1 with a step of 2. In each iteration, it adds two coordinates (i, n-1) and (n-1, i) to the ans set.
After that, it initializes two variables offset and d with 0 and 2 respectively. It enters a for loop that iterates 10 times. In each iteration, it enters two nested for loops.
The first nested for loop iterates from 1 to n-1 with a step of 2*d. The second nested for loop iterates from offset to n-1 with a step of 2*d. In each iteration of the nested for loops, it adds a coordinate (i, j) to the ans set.
After the nested for loops finish, it increments the offset by d and doubles the value of d.
Finally, it prints the size of the ans set and then prints each coordinate in the ans set.
