<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers r and s from the input. It then checks if both r and s are between 1 and 20 (inclusive). If this condition is true, it checks if both r and s are between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If this condition is also true, it prints the product of r and s. Otherwise, it prints -1.
In this case, both r and s are between 1 and 20, but they are not between 1 and 9. Therefore, the code will print -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
