<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string A using the Scanner class. It then checks if the string contains the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' using the contains() method. If all three characters are present, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input string is "bac". The string contains all three characters 'a', 'b', and 'c', so the condition is true and the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
