<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs A, B, and X.
It then calculates the value of variable d based on the following conditions:
- If X * 2 is greater than or equal to A * A * B, it calculates the value of z as (A * A * B - X) / A / A * 2 and then calculates the value of d as Math.atan(z / A) * 180 / Math.PI.
- If X * 2 is less than A * A * B, it calculates the value of z as X / A / B * 2 and then calculates the value of d as Math.atan(B / z) * 180 / Math.PI.
Finally, it prints the value of d as the output.

In this case, A = 2, B = 2, and X = 4.
Since X * 2 (4 * 2) is less than A * A * B (2 * 2 * 2), the code calculates the value of z as 4 / 2 / 2 * 2 = 2.
Then it calculates the value of d as Math.atan(2 / 2) * 180 / Math.PI = 45 degrees.
<<<Output>>>
