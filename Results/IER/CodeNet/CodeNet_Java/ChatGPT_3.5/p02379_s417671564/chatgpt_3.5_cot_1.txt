<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four double values from the input: x1, y1, x2, and y2. These values are used to calculate the distance between two points using the distance formula: sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2). The calculated distance is then printed with 8 decimal places using the printf method.
In this case, the input values are 0, 0, 1, and 1. Plugging these values into the distance formula, we get sqrt((0 - 1)^2 + (0 - 1)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2) = 1.41421356.
<<<Output>>>
1.41421356
