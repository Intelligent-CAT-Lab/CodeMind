<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input.
It subtracts the difference between A and B from C and stores the result in the variable ans.
Then it checks if ans is greater than 0. If it is, it prints ans. Otherwise, it prints 0.
In this case, A = 6, B = 4, and C = 3.
The difference between A and B is 2 (6 - 4).
So, ans = 3 - 2 = 1.
Since ans is greater than 0, the output will be 1.
