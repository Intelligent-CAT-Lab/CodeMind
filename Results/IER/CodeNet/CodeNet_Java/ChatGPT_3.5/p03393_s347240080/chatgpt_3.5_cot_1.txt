<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and checks if the length of the string is equal to 26. If it is not, it iterates through all the lowercase alphabets and checks if each alphabet is present in the input string. If an alphabet is not present, it appends that alphabet to the input string and prints the result. If the length of the string is already 26, it enters a loop that starts from the end of the string and iteratively removes characters from the end and checks if the remaining string is lexicographically smaller than the original string. If it is, it finds the smallest character that is greater than the character at the current position and appends it to the remaining string. If no such character is found, it adds the removed characters back to the set and continues to the next iteration. If the loop finishes without finding a result, it prints -1.

In this case, the input string is "atcoder". The length of the string is not 26, so it enters the first loop. It checks if each alphabet from 'a' to 'z' is present in the input string. The alphabet 'b' is not present, so it appends 'b' to the input string and prints the result.

<<<Output>>>
atcoderb
