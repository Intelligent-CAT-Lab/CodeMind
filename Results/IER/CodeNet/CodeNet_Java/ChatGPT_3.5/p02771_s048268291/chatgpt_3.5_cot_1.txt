<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input and adds them to a set. Since a set only allows unique elements, if the size of the set is 2, it means that there are two distinct integers in the input. Otherwise, if the size of the set is not 2, it means that there are either 3 distinct integers or 2 identical integers in the input. 

In this case, the input is "5 7 5". The set will contain the integers 5 and 7. The size of the set is 2, so the output will be "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
