<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d. The values of a, b, c, and d are initialized with 10, 9, 10, and 10 respectively according to the input.
Then it enters a while loop with the condition (a>0) && (c>0). Inside the loop, it subtracts the value of d from a and the value of b from c in each iteration.
The loop continues until either a or c becomes less than or equal to 0.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of c. If c is greater than 0, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, the value of c becomes 0 after the loop finishes, so the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
