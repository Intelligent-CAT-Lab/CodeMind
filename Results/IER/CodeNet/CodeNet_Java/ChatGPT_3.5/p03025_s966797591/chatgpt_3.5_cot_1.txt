<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: N, A, B, and C. It then performs a series of calculations to determine the value of the variable "sum". 

First, it calculates the values of pA and pB, which are the probabilities of choosing option A and option B, respectively. These probabilities are calculated using the formula A * inv(A + B) % MOD and B * inv(A + B) % MOD, where MOD is a constant value.

Next, it initializes three arrays: powA, powB, and combN. The powA and powB arrays store the powers of pA and pB, respectively, up to the value of N. The combN array stores the values of the combination function for each value of i from 0 to N.

Then, it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to N-1. In each iteration, it calculates the values of a and b using the powA and powB arrays, respectively. It then calculates the value of the variable "sum" by multiplying (N + i) with the sum of a and b, and then multiplying it by the value of combN[i]. This value is added to the current value of "sum".

After the loop finishes, it multiplies "sum" by 100 and takes the modulo with MOD. It then multiplies the result by the inverse of (A + B) and takes the modulo with MOD again. The final value of "sum" is printed as the output.
