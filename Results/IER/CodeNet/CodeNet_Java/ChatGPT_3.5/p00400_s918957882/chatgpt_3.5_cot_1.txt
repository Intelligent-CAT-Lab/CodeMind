The variable c is initialized with 67 according to the input. And variable code is initialized with 0.
It reads the value of variable c using the Scanner class.
Then it checks if the value of variable c falls within the range [65, 90]. If it does, it assigns 1 to variable code.
If the first condition is not met, it checks if the value of variable c falls within the range [97, 122]. If it does, it assigns 2 to variable code.
If both conditions are not met, it assigns 0 to variable code.
Finally, it prints the value of variable code as output, which is 1.
