The variable N is initialized with 2 and variable MOD is initialized with 998244353 according to the input.
A 2D array table is created with size (N+1) x (N+1).
The outer for loop iterates from rem = 0 to N, and it initializes the last row of the table with the value of rem.
The inner for loop iterates from pos = N-1 to 1, and for each pos and rem, it updates the value of table[pos][rem] based on the values of table[pos+1][rem] and table[pos][rem-factor], where factor is the minimum of pos and (N+1-pos).
Finally, it prints the value of table[1][N] as the output.
In this case, the value of table[1][N] is 1.
