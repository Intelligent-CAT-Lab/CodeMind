<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs a, b, and c using the Scanner class. It initializes a boolean variable flag as true and an integer variable y as 0. Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 60. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of x as i*60+c. Then it enters a while loop that continues until the difference between x and y is greater than or equal to a+b. In each iteration of the while loop, it increments y by a+b. After the while loop, it checks if the difference between x and y is between 1 and a (inclusive). If it is, it prints the value of x, sets the flag to false, and breaks out of the outer loop using a labeled break statement. If the flag is still true after the for loop, it prints -1. 

In this case, the input values are a=10, b=10, and c=5. The for loop iterates from 0 to 60. In each iteration, it calculates the value of x as i*60+c. Then it enters the while loop and increments y by a+b until the difference between x and y is less than a+b. After the while loop, it checks if the difference between x and y is between 1 and a (inclusive). If it is, it prints the value of x, sets the flag to false, and breaks out of the outer loop. In this case, the condition is not met for any value of i, so the flag remains true. After the for loop, it prints -1 as the output.
