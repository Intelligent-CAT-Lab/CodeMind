<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable `s`. Then it prints the substring of `s` from index 0 to 4 (exclusive) concatenated with a space and the substring of `s` from index 4 to the end. In this case, the input string is "CODEFESTIVAL", so the output will be "CODE FESTIVAL".
<<<Output>>>
CODE FESTIVAL
