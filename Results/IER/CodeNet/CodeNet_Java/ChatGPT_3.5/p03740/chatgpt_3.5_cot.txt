<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long values as input using the Scanner class. It calculates the absolute difference between the two input values using the Math.abs() method. If the absolute difference is less than or equal to 1, it prints "Brown", otherwise it prints "Alice".
In this case, the input values are 2 and 1. The absolute difference between 2 and 1 is 1, which is less than or equal to 1. Therefore, the code will print "Brown".
<<<Output>>>
Brown
