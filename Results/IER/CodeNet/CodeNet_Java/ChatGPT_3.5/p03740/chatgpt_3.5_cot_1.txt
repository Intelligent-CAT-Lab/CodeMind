<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input using the Scanner class. It calculates the absolute difference between the two numbers using the Math.abs() method. If the absolute difference is less than or equal to 1, it prints "Brown". Otherwise, it prints "Alice".
In this case, the absolute difference between 2 and 1 is 1, which is less than or equal to 1. So, the output will be "Brown".
<<<Output>>>
Brown
