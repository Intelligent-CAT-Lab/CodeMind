<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable S.
Then it checks if the character at index 2 of the string S is equal to the character at index 3 of the string S, and if the character at index 4 of the string S is equal to the character at index 5 of the string S.
If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the character at index 2 of the string "sippuu" is 'p' and the character at index 3 is also 'p'. Similarly, the character at index 4 is 'u' and the character at index 5 is also 'u'. So, both conditions are true and the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
