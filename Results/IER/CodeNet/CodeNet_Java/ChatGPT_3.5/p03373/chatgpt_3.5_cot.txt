<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads 5 integers from the input: a, b, c, x, and y.
Then it initializes a variable min with the maximum possible integer value.
It enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to the maximum of x and y.
Inside the loop, it calculates a temporary value tmp using the formula:
tmp = a * (max(0, x - i)) + b * (max(0, y - i)) + c * i * 2
Then it updates the value of min to be the minimum of min and tmp.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of min as the output.
