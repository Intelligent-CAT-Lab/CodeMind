<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input X from the user. It then checks if X is equal to 3, 5, or 7. If X is equal to any of these values, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, the input is 5. The code checks if 5 is equal to 3, which is false. Then it checks if 5 is equal to 5, which is true. Therefore, it prints "YES" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
YES
