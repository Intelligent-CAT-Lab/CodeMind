<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. Then it iterates over each character in the array and performs a transformation on it. The transformation involves subtracting 'A' from the character, subtracting 3, adding 26, taking the modulo 26, and finally adding 'A' back to the result. This effectively shifts the character 3 positions to the left in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary.

In this case, the input string is "MRL". The first character 'M' is shifted 3 positions to the left, resulting in 'J'. The second character 'R' is shifted 3 positions to the left, resulting in 'O'. The third character 'L' is shifted 3 positions to the left, resulting in 'I'. Therefore, the output of the code execution would be "JOI".
