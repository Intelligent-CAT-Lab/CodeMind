<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable w are initialized with 10 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0, variable left is initialized with 1 and variable right is initialized with w+1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to w-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it checks if k is a divisor of i. If it is, it increments the count of k and calls the update method passing k as argument. Then it checks if i/k is not equal to k. If it is not, it increments the count of i/k and calls the update method passing i/k as argument.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-w+1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it checks if k is a divisor of i. If it is, it decrements the count of k and calls the update method passing k as argument. Then it checks if i/k is not equal to k. If it is not, it decrements the count of i/k and calls the update method passing i/k as argument.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to i+w to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it checks if k is a divisor of i+w. If it is, it increments the count of k and calls the update method passing k as argument. Then it checks if (i+w)/k is not equal to k. If it is not, it increments the count of (i+w)/k and calls the update method passing (i+w)/k as argument.
After the loop finishes, it calls the update method passing left-1 as argument and then calls the update method passing right-1 as argument.
Finally, it prints the value of variable sum followed by a space if i<n-w and a new line character if i=n-w.
