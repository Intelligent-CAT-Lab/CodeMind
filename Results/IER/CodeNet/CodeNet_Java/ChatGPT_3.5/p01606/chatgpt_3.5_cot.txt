<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and w as input. It then initializes some variables and arrays. It enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to w-1. Inside the loop, it checks if i is divisible by k and if it is, it increments the count of k and updates the count and sum. It also checks if i/k is not equal to k, and if it is, it increments the count of i/k and updates the count and sum. After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and iterates from 0 to n-w. Inside this loop, it updates the count and sum by decrementing the count of k and updating the count and sum. It also updates the count and sum by incrementing the count of (i+w)/k and updating the count and sum. It then updates the count and sum by updating the count and sum of left-1 and right-1. Finally, it prints the sum+(i<n-w?" ":"\n") for each iteration of the loop.
