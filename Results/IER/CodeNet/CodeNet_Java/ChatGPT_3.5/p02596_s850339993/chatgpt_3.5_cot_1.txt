The variable K is initialized with 101 according to the input. 
It checks if K is even or not. If K is even, it prints -1 and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes variable cur with 7 and variable cnt with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100000000.
Inside the loop, it checks if cur is divisible by K. If it is, it prints the value of cnt and returns.
Otherwise, it updates the value of cur by multiplying it by 10, adding 7, and taking the modulo K. It also increments the value of cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints -1 as output.
<<<Output>>>
-1
