<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d. The input values are 2, 1, 1, and 3 respectively.
The code checks if d is less than or equal to a. In this case, d is 3 and a is 2, so the condition is not met.
Then, the code assigns the value of a to the variable sum and subtracts a from d. Now, sum is 2 and d is 1.
The code checks if d is less than or equal to b. In this case, d is 1 and b is 1, so the condition is met.
Therefore, the code prints the value of sum, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
