<<<Analysis>>>
The variable D is initialized with 0 and variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input. 
It creates a new Scanner object to read the input.
It reads the next integer from the input and assigns it to variable D.
It reads the next integer from the input and assigns it to variable N.
It closes the Scanner object.
It calculates the value of variable num as 1 (since 100^0 = 1).
It checks if the value of variable N is equal to 100. If it is, it increments the value of N by 1.
It calculates the value of variable ans as the product of num and N.
It checks if the value of variable D is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the value of N.
Otherwise, it prints the value of ans.
Since the value of D is 0, it prints the value of N, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
