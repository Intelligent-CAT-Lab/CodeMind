<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input using the Scanner class. It then checks if n is equal to m using the if statement. If the condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the values of n and m are both 3, so the condition n==m is true. Therefore, the code will print "Yes" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
