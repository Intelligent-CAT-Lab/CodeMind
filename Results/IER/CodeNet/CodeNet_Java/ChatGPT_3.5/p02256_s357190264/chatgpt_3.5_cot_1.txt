<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, x and y, using the Scanner class. The input values are 54 and 20.
Then, an instance of the Main class is created and the gcd() method is called with the input values x and y.
The gcd() method is a recursive method that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
In the gcd() method, it checks if y is equal to 0. If it is, it returns the value of x as the GCD.
If y is not equal to 0, it recursively calls the gcd() method with the values of y and x%y.
This process continues until y becomes 0, at which point the GCD is returned.
Finally, the GCD is printed as the output.
