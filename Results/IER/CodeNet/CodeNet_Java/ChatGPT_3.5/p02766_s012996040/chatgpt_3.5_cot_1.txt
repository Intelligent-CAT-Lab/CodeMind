<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It then converts the integer n to a string representation in base k using the Integer.toString() method. Finally, it calculates the length of the resulting string and prints it as output.
In this case, the code will convert the integer 11 to its binary representation (base 2) and calculate the length of the resulting string.
