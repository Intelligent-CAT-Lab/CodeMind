<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and performs the following steps:
1. It initializes an array `count` of size 26 to keep track of the count of each character in the string.
2. It initializes an array `e` of the same size as the string to keep track of whether a character at index `i` is the last occurrence of a character in the string.
3. It iterates through the string in reverse order and updates the `count` array and checks if all characters have occurred at least once. If all characters have occurred, it sets the corresponding index in the `e` array to true and resets the `count` array.
4. It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the final answer.
5. It iterates through the string again and checks if the current character is the last occurrence of a character. If it is, it finds the first character that has not occurred yet (by checking the `count` array) and appends it to the `ans` string. It also resets the `count` array.
6. Finally, it appends the first character that has not occurred yet to the `ans` string.
7. It prints the `ans` string as the output.
