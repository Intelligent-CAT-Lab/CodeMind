<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 30 according to the input. And variable count is initialized with 0. Variable a is initialized with 1 and variable b is not initialized.
It checks if x is within the range [3, 10000]. Since x is 30, the condition is met.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 29 to check each integer count in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if a is divisible by 3. If it is, it appends a to the StringBuilder sb.
If a is not divisible by 3, it assigns the value of a to variable b and enters a while loop.
Inside the while loop, it checks if b has a digit 3. If it does, it appends a to the StringBuilder sb and breaks out of the while loop.
After the loop finishes, it increments the value of a by 1 and continues to the next iteration of the for loop.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the final value of StringBuilder sb as output.
<<<Output>>>
