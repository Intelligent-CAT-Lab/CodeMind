<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then initializes a boolean variable flag to false.
The code checks three conditions:
1. If a is equal to b and b is not equal to c, it sets flag to true.
2. If b is equal to c and c is not equal to a, it sets flag to true.
3. If c is equal to a and a is not equal to b, it sets flag to true.

In this case, a=5, b=7, and c=5. The first condition is not met because a is not equal to b. The second condition is not met because b is not equal to c. However, the third condition is met because c is equal to a. Therefore, flag is set to true.

Finally, the code checks the value of flag. If flag is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
