<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user. It then initializes variables n, sum, ptr, cnt, and curr. The variable n is assigned the length of the input string. The variable sum is initialized to 0. The variable ptr is initialized to 0. The variable cnt is initialized to 0. The variable curr is initialized to 0.

The code then enters a while loop that continues until ptr is less than n. Inside the while loop, it checks if the character at index ptr in the input string is '>'. If it is, it enters another while loop that continues until ptr is less than n and the character at index ptr is '>'. Inside this inner while loop, it increments ptr and cnt. 

After the inner while loop, the code checks if curr is greater than cnt. If it is, it adds curr plus the sum of the arithmetic series from 1 to cnt (inclusive) to the variable sum. If curr is not greater than cnt, it adds the sum of the arithmetic series from 1 to cnt+1 (inclusive) to the variable sum. 

After calculating the sum, the code resets curr and cnt to 0. 

If the character at index n-1 in the input string is '<', the code adds curr to the variable sum. 

Finally, the code prints the value of sum.

In this case, the input string is "<>>". The code first checks if the character at index 0 is '>'. Since it is not, it adds curr (which is 0) to the sum. Then it increments curr to 1 and ptr to 1. 

The code then checks if the character at index 1 is '>'. Since it is, it enters an inner while loop that increments ptr to 2 and cnt to 1. 

After the inner while loop, the code checks if curr is greater than cnt. Since curr is not greater than cnt, it adds the sum of the arithmetic series from 1 to cnt+1 (inclusive) to the sum. 

The code then resets curr and cnt to 0. 

The code then checks if the character at index 2 is '>'. Since it is, it enters an inner while loop that increments ptr to 3 and cnt to 1. 

After the inner while loop, the code checks if curr is greater than cnt. Since curr is not greater than cnt, it adds the sum of the arithmetic series from 1 to cnt+1 (inclusive) to the sum. 

The code then resets curr and cnt to 0. 

The code then checks if the character at index 3 is '>'. Since it is not, it adds curr (which is 0) to the sum. 

Finally, the code prints the value of sum, which is 4.
