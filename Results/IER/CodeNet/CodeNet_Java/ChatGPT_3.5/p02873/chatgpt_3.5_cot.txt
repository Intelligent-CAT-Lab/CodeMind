<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and iterates through each character of the string. It keeps track of the number of consecutive '>' characters using the variable 'cnt'. If a '<' character is encountered, it adds the value of 'curr' to the sum and increments 'curr' by 1. If a '>' character is encountered, it calculates the sum based on the value of 'curr' and 'cnt'. If 'curr' is greater than 'cnt', it adds 'curr' to the sum and also adds the sum of the arithmetic progression from 1 to 'cnt' to the sum. If 'curr' is less than or equal to 'cnt', it adds the sum of the arithmetic progression from 1 to 'cnt+1' to the sum. Finally, if the last character of the string is '<', it adds the value of 'curr' to the sum. The final sum is printed as the output.

In the given input string '<>>', the code will iterate through each character as follows:
- The first character is '<', so 'curr' is incremented by 1.
- The second character is '>', so 'cnt' is incremented by 1.
- The third character is '>', so 'cnt' is incremented by 1.
- Since the next character is not '>', the code adds the value of 'curr' (which is 1) to the sum.
- The last character is '>', so the code calculates the sum based on the values of 'curr' and 'cnt'. Since 'curr' is less than 'cnt', it adds the sum of the arithmetic progression from 1 to 'cnt+1' (which is 3) to the sum.

Therefore, the return value of '<>>' would be 4.
