<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable `day`. It then uses a switch statement to check the value of `day`. If `day` is equal to 25, it prints "Christmas". If `day` is equal to 24, it prints "Christmas Eve". If `day` is equal to 23, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve". If `day` is equal to 22, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve Eve". Since the input is 25, the case for 25 is matched and "Christmas" is printed.
<<<Output>>>
Christmas
