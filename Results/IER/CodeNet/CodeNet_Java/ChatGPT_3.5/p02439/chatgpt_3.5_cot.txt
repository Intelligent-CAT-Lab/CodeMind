<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then finds the minimum value between a and b using the Math.min() function and stores it in the variable min. Similarly, it finds the maximum value between a and b using the Math.max() function and stores it in the variable max. Finally, it prints the minimum value between min and c, followed by the maximum value between max and c.

In this case, the input values are 4, 5, and 3. The minimum value between 4 and 5 is 4, and the maximum value is 5. Therefore, the output will be "3 5".

<<<Output>>>
3 5
