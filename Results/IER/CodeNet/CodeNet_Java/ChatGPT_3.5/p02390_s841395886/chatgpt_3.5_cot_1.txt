<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with 46979 according to the input. And variables h, m and s are initialized with 0.
It calculates the value of variable h by dividing S by 3600, which is 46979 / 3600 = 13.
Then it calculates the value of variable m by subtracting the product of h and 3600 from S and then dividing the result by 60, which is (46979 - 13 * 3600) / 60 = 59.
Finally, it calculates the value of variable s by subtracting the product of h and 3600 and the product of m and 60 from S, which is 46979 - (13 * 3600 + 59 * 60) = 19.
After the calculations, it prints the values of h, m and s separated by colons as output, which is "13:59:19".
<<<Output>>>
13:59:19
