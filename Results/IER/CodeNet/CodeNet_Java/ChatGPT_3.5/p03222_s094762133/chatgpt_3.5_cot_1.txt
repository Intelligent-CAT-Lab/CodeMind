The variable h, variable w and variable k are initialized with 1, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable mod is initialized with 1_000_000_007L.
Then it reads the input from the user and stores it in an array p after splitting it by space. The values of h, w and k are extracted from the array p.
Then it closes the BufferedReader.
Then it initializes a 2D array a with dimensions (h+1) x (w+2) and a 1D array f with size (w+2).
Then it sets the initial values of a[0][1] to 1, f[0] to 0, f[1] to 1 and f[2] to 1.
Then it enters a for loop from i=3 to i<w+2 and calculates the values of f[i] using the formula f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2].
Then it enters a nested for loop from i=1 to i<h+1 and j=1 to j<w+1 and calculates the values of a[i][j] using the formula:
a[i][j] = (f[j-1]*f[w-j+1]*a[i-1][j-1]%mod + f[j]*f[w-j+1]*a[i-1][j]%mod + f[j]*f[w-j]*a[i-1][j+1]%mod) % mod.
Finally, it prints the value of a[h][k] as the output.
