The code reads an integer n from the input. If n is 0, the code returns and terminates. Otherwise, it continues to read n strings from the input and stores them in an array called s. 

The code then initializes a variable called bit with a value of (1 << n) - 1. This variable represents a bitmask with all bits set to 1. 

Next, the code initializes an array called unvalid with n elements, all set to false. 

The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates over each index i from 0 to n-1. The inner loop iterates over each index j from 0 to n-1. 

Inside the inner loop, the code checks if the i-th bit of the variable bit is 0. If it is, the code continues to the next iteration of the inner loop. 

If the i-th bit of bit is 1, the code enters another loop. This loop iterates over each index k from 0 to the length of the string at index j in the array s. 

Inside this loop, the code checks if the length of the string at index i in the array s is greater than the length of the string at index j in the array s. If it is, the code continues to the next iteration of the inner loop. 

If the length of the string at index i in the array s is not greater than the length of the string at index j in the array s, the code extracts a substring from the string at index j in the array s, starting at index k and ending at index k + the length of the string at index i in the array s. 

The code then checks if this substring is equal to the string at index i in the array s. If it is, the code sets the i-th bit of the variable bit to 0 by performing a bitwise NOT operation on bit, then performing a bitwise OR operation with the result of shifting 1 to the left by i positions. 

After the nested loop finishes, the code initializes a 2D array called memo with dimensions (1 << n) and n. Each element of the array is initialized to -1. 

The code then initializes a variable called min with a value of Integer.MAX_VALUE/4. 

The code enters another loop, which iterates over each index i from 0 to n-1. 

Inside this loop, the code checks if the i-th bit of the variable bit is 1. If it is, the code initializes a variable called d with the result of performing a bitwise NOT operation on bit, then performing a bitwise OR operation with the result of shifting 1 to the left by i positions. 

The code then calculates the minimum value of min and the result of calling the dp function with arguments d, i, n, unvalid, and s. The dp function is a recursive function that returns the minimum length of a string that can be formed by concatenating a subset of the strings in the array s, starting from the string at index i and excluding any strings that have their corresponding element in the unvalid array set to true. 

After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of min as the output.
