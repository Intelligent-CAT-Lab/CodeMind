<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of a string and splits it into three parts: w, h, and c. These parts are then converted into integers.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of w and h using the gcd() method. It divides w and h by the gcd to get the reduced values gw and gh.
The code then calculates the fee by multiplying gw, gh, and c.
Finally, the code prints the value of fee as the output.
In this case, w=10, h=20, and c=5. The gcd of 10 and 20 is 10. So, gw=10/10=1 and gh=20/10=2. The fee is calculated as (1*2)*5=10.
<<<Output>>>
10
