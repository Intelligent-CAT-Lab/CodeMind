<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d. It then checks if a is equal to c. If it is, it prints the value of b and returns. Otherwise, it checks if b is equal to d. If it is, it prints the value of a and returns. If neither of these conditions is met, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute differences between a and c, and b and d. It then prints the sum of the absolute differences minus the GCD.
In this case, a = 1, b = 1, c = 3, and d = 4. Since a is not equal to c and b is not equal to d, the code calculates the GCD of |1 - 3| = 2 and |1 - 4| = 3, which is 1. The sum of the absolute differences is 2 + 3 = 5. Subtracting the GCD, the output is 5 - 1 = 4.
