<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string from the input. It then finds the index of the first occurrence of the character 'C' in the string and the index of the last occurrence of the character 'F' in the string. If either of these characters is not present in the string or if the index of 'F' is less than the index of 'C', it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, the string is "CODEFESTIVAL". The index of 'C' is 1 and the index of 'F' is 10. Since 'F' comes after 'C' in the string, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
