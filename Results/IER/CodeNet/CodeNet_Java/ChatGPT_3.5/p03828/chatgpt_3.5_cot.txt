<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and calculates the prime factorization of each number from 2 to `n`. It stores the exponents of each prime factor in an array `ex`. Then, it calculates the answer by multiplying the exponents of each prime factor plus 1, modulo `MOD`. Finally, it prints the answer.

In this case, the input `n` is 3. The code calculates the prime factorization of 2 and 3, and stores the exponents in the `ex` array. The exponents for 2 and 3 are both 1. Then, it calculates the answer by multiplying (1+1) * (1+1) = 4, modulo `MOD`. The final answer is 4.
