The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. An array ex of size 1001 is initialized with all elements as 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it calls the primeFactorize method passing the current integer i as argument. This method returns a list of maps, where each map represents the prime factorization of the number i.
For each map in the list, it iterates over the entries of the map and updates the ex array by adding the value of the entry to the corresponding index.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3.
Inside this loop, it calculates the product of each element in the ex array plus 1 and assigns it to the variable ans. It also takes the modulo of ans with MOD.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
