The variable K is initialized with 15 according to the input. 
A priority queue and a hash set are initialized to store the numbers.
A for loop is used to add the numbers from 1 to 9 to the priority queue and hash set.
Then a while loop is used to generate more numbers until the size of the priority queue reaches K.
Inside the while loop, a new hash set is created to store the newly generated numbers.
A nested for loop is used to iterate through each number in the current hash set.
Inside the nested for loop, the last digit of the number is extracted and stored in variable t.
Another for loop is used to iterate through -1, 0, and 1 to generate new numbers by adding t+j to the end of the current number.
If the generated number is already in the original hash set or the new hash set, it is skipped.
Otherwise, it is added to both the new hash set and the priority queue.
After the while loop finishes, the first K-1 numbers are removed from the priority queue.
Finally, the last number in the priority queue is printed as the output.
