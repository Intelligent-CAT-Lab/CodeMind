<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
The code then creates a 2D array called ret with size n x n.
It then calls the dfs method passing the initial values of left, right, level, and ret.
Inside the dfs method, it checks if the condition left + 1 >= right is true. If it is, it returns and does nothing.
If the condition is false, it calculates the value of center as the average of left and right.
Then it enters a nested for loop where i iterates from left to center-1 and j iterates from center to right-1.
Inside the nested loop, it assigns the value of level to ret[i][j] and ret[j][j].
After the nested loop, it calls the dfs method recursively passing the values of left, center, level+1, and ret.
Then it calls the dfs method recursively again passing the values of center, right, level+1, and ret.
Finally, it enters a for loop where i iterates from 0 to n-2.
Inside the for loop, it creates a StringBuilder object called sb.
Then it enters another for loop where j iterates from i+1 to n-1.
Inside the nested for loop, it appends the value of ret[i][j] followed by a space to the StringBuilder sb.
After the nested loop, it prints the substring of sb from index 0 to sb.length()-1.
