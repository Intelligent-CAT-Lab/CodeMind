<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a method `solve()` which is called from the `main()` method. 
Inside the `solve()` method, it reads an integer `n` from the input.
Then it creates a 2D array `ret` of size `n`x`n`.
It calls the `dfs()` method passing the initial values of `left`, `right`, `level`, and `ret`.
The `dfs()` method is a recursive method that fills the `ret` array with values based on the given conditions.
It first checks if `left + 1 >= right`, if true, it returns.
Then it calculates the `center` as the average of `left` and `right`.
It then iterates over the range `left` to `center-1` and `center` to `right-1` and sets the values of `ret[i][j]` and `ret[j][j]` to `level`.
After that, it makes two recursive calls to `dfs()` with the ranges `left` to `center` and `center` to `right`, and `level+1`.
Finally, it enters a loop from `i=0` to `n-2` and inside that loop, it creates a `StringBuilder` to store the values of `ret[i][j]` for `j=i+1` to `n-1`.
It then prints the values stored in the `StringBuilder` as the output.
