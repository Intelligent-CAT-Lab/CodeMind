<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and stores them in an array x. Then it sorts the array in ascending order. 
Next, it calculates the value of temp as 2 times the largest element of the array minus the sum of the other two elements.
Then it checks if temp is odd or even. If it is odd, it adds 2 to temp, divides it by 2, and adds 1 to get the value of ans. If it is even, it divides temp by 2 to get the value of ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the input is 2, 5, and 4. After sorting the array, the values become 2, 4, and 5. 
The value of temp is calculated as 2*5 - 4 - 2 = 6.
Since temp is even, the value of ans is 6/2 = 3.
