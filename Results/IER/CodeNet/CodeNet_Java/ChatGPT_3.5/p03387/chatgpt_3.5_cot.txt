<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and stores them in an array `x`. It then sorts the array in ascending order. In this case, the array becomes [2, 4, 5].
Next, it calculates the value of `temp` as `2*x[2] - x[1] - x[0]`, which is `2*5 - 4 - 2 = 6`.
Then, it checks if `temp` is odd or even. Since `temp` is 6, which is even, it assigns `temp/2` to `ans`, which is `6/2 = 3`.
Finally, it prints the value of `ans`, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
