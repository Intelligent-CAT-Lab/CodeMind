<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. Then it sorts the character array in ascending order. 
After that, it checks if there are any consecutive characters in the sorted array that are the same. If it finds any, it prints "no" and returns. 
If it doesn't find any consecutive characters that are the same, it prints "yes".
In this case, the input string is "uncopyrightable". After sorting the characters, the array becomes "abcehilnoprtyu". 
There are no consecutive characters that are the same, so the output will be "yes".
<<<Output>>>
yes
