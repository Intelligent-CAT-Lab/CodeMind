<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4 according to the input. And variables total, diff and max are initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to N to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable total.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the total sum of the numbers from 1 to i using the formula (i+1) * i / 2. If the calculated total is greater than or equal to N, it assigns the value of i to variable max and calculates the difference between the calculated total and N and assigns it to variable diff. Then it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to max. Inside this loop, it checks if the current integer i is not equal to diff. If it is not equal, it prints the value of i.
So, the output will be:
1
2
3
