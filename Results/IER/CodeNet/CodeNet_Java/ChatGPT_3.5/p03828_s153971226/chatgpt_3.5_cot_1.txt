The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable mod is initialized with 1000000007. Variable sosu is an array of long type with size n+1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the prime factorization of the current integer j by repeatedly dividing it by prime numbers. The prime numbers are found by iterating from 2 to j and checking if j is divisible by k. If it is divisible, the count of prime number k is incremented in the sosu array and j is divided by k. This process continues until j becomes 1.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the final answer by multiplying all the counts of prime numbers in the sosu array and taking the modulo with mod. The answer is then printed as output.
In this case, the prime factorization of 2 is 2^1, the prime factorization of 3 is 3^1, so the answer is (1+1)*(1+1) = 4.
