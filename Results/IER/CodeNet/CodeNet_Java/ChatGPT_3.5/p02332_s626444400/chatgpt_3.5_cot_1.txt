<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And an array dp of size K+1 is initialized with all elements as 0.
Since N is less than or equal to K, it enters the else block. It initializes a variable ans with 1 and a variable mod with 1000000007.
Then it enters a for loop which iterates from K to K-N+1. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of ans with the current value of i and takes the modulo with mod.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output.
