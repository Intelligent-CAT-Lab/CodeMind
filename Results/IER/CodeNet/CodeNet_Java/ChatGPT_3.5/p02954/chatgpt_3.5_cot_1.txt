<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input `S` which is "RRLRL". It initializes the variable `N` with the length of the string, which is 5. It also initializes an integer array `ans` with the same length as the string.

Then it enters a while loop which iterates until `curIndex` is less than `N`. Inside the loop, it checks the consecutive characters of the string starting from `curIndex`. If the character is 'R', it increments the `numRight` variable and moves the `curIndex` forward. If the character is 'L', it increments the `numLeft` variable and moves the `curIndex` forward. This process continues until the character is not 'R' or 'L' or until `curIndex` reaches the end of the string.

After counting the number of 'R' and 'L' in the current sequence, it calculates the values of `left` and `right` based on the parity of the sum of `numLeft` and `numRight`. If the sum is even, it divides the sum equally between `left` and `right`. If the sum is odd, it assigns the greater value to the count with odd parity.

Then it assigns the values of `left` and `right` to the `ans` array at the index `R` and `R+1` respectively.

Finally, it prints the elements of the `ans` array separated by a space.
