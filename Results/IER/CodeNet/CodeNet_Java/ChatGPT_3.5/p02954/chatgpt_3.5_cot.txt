<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input `S` which is equal to "RRLRL". It then calculates the length of the string and stores it in variable `N`. It also initializes an integer array `ans` of size `N` to store the answer. It initializes `curIndex` to 0.

The code then enters a while loop which continues until `curIndex` is less than `N`. Inside the loop, it initializes `numLeft` and `numRight` to 0. It then checks if the character at index `curIndex` in string `S` is equal to 'R'. If it is, it increments `numRight` and `curIndex`. It continues this process until the character at index `curIndex` is not 'R'. It then stores the value of `curIndex-1` in variable `R`.

Next, it enters another while loop which checks if the character at index `curIndex` in string `S` is equal to 'L'. If it is, it increments `numLeft` and `curIndex`. It continues this process until the character at index `curIndex` is not 'L'.

After calculating the values of `numLeft` and `numRight`, it checks if the sum of `numLeft` and `numRight` is even. If it is, it assigns `left` and `right` the value of `sum/2`. If the sum is odd, it assigns `left` the value of `sum/2` and `right` the value of `sum-left`.

Then, it assigns `left` to `ans[R]` and `right` to `ans[R+1]`. It then checks if `curIndex` is equal to `N-1`. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.

Finally, it prints the elements of the `ans` array separated by a space.
