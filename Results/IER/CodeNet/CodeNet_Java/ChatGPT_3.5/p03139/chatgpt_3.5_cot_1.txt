<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers N, A, and B from the input. It then calculates the minimum of A and B and the maximum of 0 and the sum of A and B minus N. Finally, it prints the calculated values separated by a space.

In this case, N = 10, A = 3, and B = 5. The minimum of A and B is 3. The sum of A and B minus N is 3 + 5 - 10 = -2. The maximum of 0 and -2 is 0. Therefore, the output will be "3 0".

<<<Output>>>
3 0
