<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: N, A, and B. It then calculates the minimum value between A and B using the Math.min() function and the maximum value between 0 and the sum of A and B minus N using the Math.max() function. Finally, it prints the calculated values separated by a space.

In this case, N = 10, A = 3, and B = 5. The minimum value between A and B is 3. The sum of A and B is 8, and subtracting N from it gives 8 - 10 = -2. Since -2 is less than 0, the maximum value between 0 and -2 is 0.

Therefore, the output would be "3 0".
