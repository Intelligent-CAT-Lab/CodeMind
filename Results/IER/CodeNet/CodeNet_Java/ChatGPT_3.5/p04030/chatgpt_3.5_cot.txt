<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input `s` and initializes an empty string `t`. It then iterates through each character in `s` using a for loop. 
If the current character is not 'B', it appends it to the string `t`. If the current character is 'B' and `t` is empty, it continues to the next iteration. 
If the current character is 'B' and `t` is not empty, it removes the last character from `t`. 
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of `t` as the output.

In this case, the input string is "01B0". 
The first character is '0', so it is appended to `t`. 
The second character is '1', so it is appended to `t`. 
The third character is 'B', so the last character is removed from `t`. 
The fourth character is '0', so it is appended to `t`. 
After the loop finishes, the final value of `t` is "010".
