<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in variable s. It then initializes an empty string variable t.
It then iterates through each character in the string s. If the character is not 'B', it appends it to the string t.
If the character is 'B' and the string t is empty, it continues to the next iteration.
If the character is 'B' and the string t is not empty, it removes the last character from the string t.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of the string t as output.
In this case, the input string is "01B0". The first character '0' is appended to t. The second character '1' is also appended to t. The third character 'B' is ignored because t is not empty. The last character '0' is appended to t. So the final value of t is "010".
<<<Output>>>
010
