<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a FastReader object and a Main object. It then reads an input integer h using the nextLong() method of the FastReader object. 
If h is equal to 1, it prints 1 as the output. Otherwise, it enters a while loop where it divides h by 2 and adds the result of 2 raised to the power of a count variable to the sum variable. The count variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration. 
Finally, it prints the value of sum + 1 as the output.
In this case, the input is 2. The code enters the else block and performs the following iterations:
1. h = 2, count = 1, sum = 0 + 2^1 = 2
2. h = 1, count = 2, sum = 2 + 2^2 = 6
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of sum + 1, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
