The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable x is initialized with 7 according to the input. An array called layer is created with size n.
Then, a for loop is used to populate the layer array. For each index i, if i is 0, then layer[i] is set to 1. Otherwise, layer[i] is set to layer[i-1] multiplied by 2 and then added by 3.
After that, the code calls the pati() method passing n and x as arguments and assigns the returned value to the variable ans.
Inside the pati() method, there are several if-else conditions. If n is 0, it returns 1. If x is less than or equal to 1, it returns 0. If x is less than or equal to 1 plus layer[n-1], it calls pati() recursively with n-1 and x-1 as arguments. If layer[n-1]+2 is equal to x, it calls pati() recursively with n-1 and x-2 as arguments and adds 1 to the result. If x is less than 2 times layer[n-1]+2, it calls pati() recursively with n-1 and layer[n-1] as arguments, adds 1 to the result, and then calls pati() recursively with n-1 and x-1-layer[n-1]-1 as arguments. Otherwise, it calls pati() recursively with n-1 and layer[n-1] as arguments and multiplies the result by 2, then adds 1 to the result.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans as the output.
