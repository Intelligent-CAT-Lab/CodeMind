<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and converts it into a character array. It then iterates through each character in the array and checks if the character is 'C'. If it is, it sets the boolean variable b1 to true. Then, it checks if b1 is true and the current character is 'F'. If both conditions are true, it sets the boolean variable b2 to true. Finally, it prints "Yes" if b2 is true, and "No" otherwise.

In this case, the input string is "CODEFESTIVAL". The code iterates through each character in the string and sets b1 to true when it encounters the character 'C'. Then, when it encounters the character 'F' and b1 is true, it sets b2 to true. Since b2 is true, the output will be "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
