<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and stores them in variables a and b. Then it calls the GCD function passing a and b as arguments.
Inside the GCD function, it checks if a is less than b. If it is, it swaps the values of a and b.
Then it checks if a is divisible by b. If it is, it returns b as the GCD.
If a is not divisible by b, it recursively calls the GCD function with b as the new value of a and a%b as the new value of b.
This process continues until a is divisible by b, and then it returns the value of b as the GCD.
Finally, the main function prints the output of the GCD function.
In this case, the input is 54 and 20. The GCD of 54 and 20 is 2.
