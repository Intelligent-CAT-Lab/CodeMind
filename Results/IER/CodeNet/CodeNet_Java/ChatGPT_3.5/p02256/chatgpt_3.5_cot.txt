The code takes two integers as input, a and b. It then calls the GCD function passing a and b as arguments. 
Inside the GCD function, it checks if a is less than b. If it is, it swaps the values of a and b. 
Then it checks if a is divisible by b. If it is, it returns b as the GCD. 
If a is not divisible by b, it recursively calls the GCD function with b as the new value of a and a%b as the new value of b. 
This process continues until a is divisible by b. 
In this case, the input values are 54 and 20. 
Since 54 is not less than 20, the values of a and b remain the same. 
54 is not divisible by 20, so the GCD function is called again with 20 as the new value of a and 54%20 = 14 as the new value of b. 
Since 20 is not divisible by 14, the GCD function is called again with 14 as the new value of a and 20%14 = 6 as the new value of b. 
Since 14 is not divisible by 6, the GCD function is called again with 6 as the new value of a and 14%6 = 2 as the new value of b. 
Since 6 is divisible by 2, the GCD function returns 2 as the GCD.
