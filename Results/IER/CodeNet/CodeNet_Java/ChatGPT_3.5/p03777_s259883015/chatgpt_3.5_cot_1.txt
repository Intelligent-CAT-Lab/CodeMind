<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two strings from the input using the Scanner class. The first string is assigned to variable 'a' and the second string is assigned to variable 'b'. 
Then it uses the equals() method to compare the two strings. If the strings are equal, it prints "H", otherwise it prints "D".
In this case, the input strings are "H" and "H", which are equal. So the output will be "H".
<<<Output>>>
H
