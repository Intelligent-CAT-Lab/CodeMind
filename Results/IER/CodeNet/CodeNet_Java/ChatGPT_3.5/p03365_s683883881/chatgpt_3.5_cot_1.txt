<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input. Then the solve() method is called.
Inside the solve() method, the fac and iFac arrays are initialized with size n+1. Then the fillFactorials() method is called to fill the fac and iFac arrays with factorial values.
After that, the variable ans is initialized with 0 and prevWays is initialized with 0.
Then it checks if n is equal to 2 or 3. If it is, then ans is assigned with 1 or 4 respectively.
If n is not equal to 2 or 3, it calculates the start value based on whether n is even or odd.
Then it enters a for loop starting from start and ending at n-1.
Inside the loop, it calculates the number of ways to choose k-1 elements from n-1-k elements and multiplies it with fac[k] and fac[n-1-k] to get the total number of ways.
Then it updates ans by adding (ways - prevWays + MOD) * k % MOD to it.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
