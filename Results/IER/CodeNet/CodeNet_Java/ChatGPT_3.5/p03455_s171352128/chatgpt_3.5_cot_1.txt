<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input, multiplies them together, and then checks if the result is even or odd. If the result is even, it prints "Even", otherwise it prints "Odd".
In this case, the code reads the integers 3 and 4 from the input, multiplies them together to get 12, and since 12 is even, it prints "Even".
<<<Output>>>
Even
