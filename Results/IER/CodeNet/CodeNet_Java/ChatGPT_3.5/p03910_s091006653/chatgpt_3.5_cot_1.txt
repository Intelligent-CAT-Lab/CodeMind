<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4 according to the input. And variable res and variable sum are initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable sum is less than or equal to N. If it is, it increments the value of variable res by 1 and adds it to variable sum.
Inside the while loop, it also checks if the value of variable sum is equal to N. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable sum is greater than N. If it is, it subtracts the value of variable res from variable sum and decrements the value of variable res by 1.
Then it initializes an integer array ans with size res+1 and assigns the values from 1 to res to the elements of the array.
It calculates the value of len by subtracting the value of variable sum from N.
Then it enters a for loop and it starts from res and iterates down to res+1-len. In each iteration, it increments the value of the current element of array ans by 1.
Finally, it creates a PrintWriter object out and prints each element of array ans on a new line.
