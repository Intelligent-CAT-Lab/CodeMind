<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string from the input and stores it in the variable `line`. It then checks if the length of the string is less than 26. If it is, it adds the smallest character that is not present in the string to the end of the string and prints the modified string. If the length of the string is equal to 26, it checks if the string is equal to the string "zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba". If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it finds the lexicographically next string that is not equal to the input string and prints it. The function `next` is used to find the next string recursively by trying all possible characters at each position in the string.
