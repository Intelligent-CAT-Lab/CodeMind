<<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a TreeSet called "set" and adds all lowercase alphabets to it.
Then it reads a line of input and iterates through each character in the line.
For each character, it removes it from the set.
After iterating through all characters in the line, it checks if the set is empty.
If the set is not empty, it appends the first character from the set to the line and prints the modified line.
If the set is empty, it checks if the line is equal to "zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba".
If it is, it prints -1.
If it is not, it calls the "next" method passing the line and an empty string as arguments.
The "next" method is a recursive method that generates the next lexicographically smallest string that is not a subsequence of the input line.
If the "next" method returns true, it means a valid string was found and it is printed.
If the "next" method returns false, it means no valid string was found and nothing is printed.
