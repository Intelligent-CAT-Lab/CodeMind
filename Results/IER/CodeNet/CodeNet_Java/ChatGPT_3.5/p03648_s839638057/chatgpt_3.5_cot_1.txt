<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 0 according to the input. And variable n is initialized with 50. An array a of size n is created and all elements are initialized with r+i, where r is (k+n-1)/n and i is the index of the element in the array.
In this case, r is 0 and all elements in array a are initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the value of rem, which is (r*n-k). In this case, rem is 0.
Then it prints the value of n, which is 50, followed by the elements of array a, which are all 0.
<<<Output>>>
