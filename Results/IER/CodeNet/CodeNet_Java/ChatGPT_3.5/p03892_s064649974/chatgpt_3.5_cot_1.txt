<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four long integers as input: a, b, c, and d. The input values are 1, 1, 3, and 4 respectively.
It calculates the absolute difference between a and c and stores it in the variable dx. Similarly, it calculates the absolute difference between b and d and stores it in the variable dy.
Then it calls the help() method passing the minimum of dx and dy as the first argument and the maximum of dx and dy as the second argument.
Inside the help() method, it checks if the first argument w is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 0.
If w is not equal to 0, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of w and h (where w is the first argument and h is the second argument).
If the gcd is equal to 1, it returns w+h-1.
If the gcd is not equal to 1, it multiplies the gcd with the result of calling the help() method recursively with the arguments w divided by the gcd and h divided by the gcd.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
