<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 5 integers as input: h1, m1, h2, m2, and k. These integers represent the starting hour, starting minute, ending hour, ending minute, and the duration in minutes, respectively.
It calculates the difference in hours and minutes between the starting and ending times by subtracting h1 from h2 and m1 from m2, respectively.
Then it calculates the total duration in minutes by multiplying the difference in hours by 60 and adding the difference in minutes.
Finally, it subtracts the duration k from the total duration and prints the result as the output.
In this case, the starting time is 10:00 and the ending time is 15:00, with a duration of 30 minutes. So the total duration is 300 minutes. Subtracting 30 minutes from 300 minutes gives us 270 minutes as the output.
<<<Output>>>
270
