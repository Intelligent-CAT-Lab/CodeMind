<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 5 integers as input: h1, m1, h2, m2, and k.
It calculates the difference between h2 and h1 and stores it in the variable h.
It calculates the difference between m2 and m1 and stores it in the variable m.
It calculates the total minutes passed between the two times by multiplying h by 60 and adding m to it, and stores it in the variable day.
It subtracts k from day and prints the result as the output.
In this case, the input is "10 0 15 0 30", so h1 = 10, m1 = 0, h2 = 15, m2 = 0, and k = 30.
The difference between h2 and h1 is 15 - 10 = 5.
The difference between m2 and m1 is 0 - 0 = 0.
The total minutes passed between the two times is (5 * 60) + 0 = 300.
Subtracting k from day, we get 300 - 30 = 270.
Therefore, the output is 270.
