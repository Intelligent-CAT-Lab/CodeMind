<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and initializes a boolean array called "dir" with 4 elements. It then iterates through each character in the input string and checks if it is 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W'. If it is one of these characters, it sets the corresponding element in the "dir" array to true.

After iterating through all the characters, it checks if the elements at index 0 and 1 of the "dir" array are equal, and if the elements at index 2 and 3 of the "dir" array are equal. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

In this case, the input string is "SENW". So, the elements at index 0 and 1 of the "dir" array will be set to true because 'N' and 'S' are present in the input string. Similarly, the elements at index 2 and 3 of the "dir" array will be set to true because 'E' and 'W' are present in the input string.

Since both conditions are true (dir[0] == dir[1] and dir[2] == dir[3]), the code will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
