<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input. And a boolean array A of size 10000 is created and initialized with false.
A variable count is initialized with 1.
The value of n-1 index of array A is set to true.
Then it enters a while loop which continues until a break statement is encountered.
Inside the loop, it checks if n is divisible by 2. If it is, it divides n by 2. Otherwise, it multiplies n by 3 and adds 1 to it.
Then it checks if the value of n-1 index of array A is true. If it is, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it sets the value of n-1 index of array A to true and increments the count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of count + 1 as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
