<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input N. It then iterates through each character of the string using a for loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the index i is even or odd. If i is even, it checks if the character c is 'L'. If it is, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop. If i is odd, it checks if the character c is 'R'. If it is, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop. If none of these conditions are met, it checks if i is equal to the length of the string minus 1. If it is, it prints "Yes".

In the given input "RUDLUDR", the code will iterate through each character of the string. The first character is 'R' and the index is 0, which is even. Since 'R' is not 'L', it continues to the next iteration. The second character is 'U' and the index is 1, which is odd. Since 'U' is not 'R', it continues to the next iteration. The third character is 'D' and the index is 2, which is even. Since 'D' is not 'L', it continues to the next iteration. The fourth character is 'L' and the index is 3, which is odd. Since 'L' is 'L', it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.

Therefore, the output of the code execution will be "No".
