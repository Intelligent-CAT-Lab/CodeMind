<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string N. It then iterates through each character of the string using a for loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the index i is even or odd. If i is even, it checks if the character at index i is 'L'. If it is, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop. If i is odd, it checks if the character at index i is 'R'. If it is, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop. If none of these conditions are met, it checks if i is equal to N.length() - 1, which means it has reached the last character of the string. If it is, it prints "Yes".

In the given input string "RUDLUDR", the code will iterate through each character as follows:
- i = 0, c = 'R', i is even, c is not 'L', continue to next iteration
- i = 1, c = 'U', i is odd, continue to next iteration
- i = 2, c = 'D', i is even, c is not 'L', continue to next iteration
- i = 3, c = 'L', i is odd, c is 'L', print "No" and break out of the loop

Therefore, the output will be "No".
