<<<Analysis>>>
The variable r, variable c, variable a and variable b are initialized with 2, 3, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable mod is initialized with 1000000007.
It initializes two arrays fact and ifact with size r+c. It sets the first element of both arrays to 1.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to r+c-1. In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current number and stores it in the fact array. It also calculates the modular inverse of the current number and stores it in the ifact array.
After the loop, it calculates the value of res by multiplying the factorial of r-1+c-1 with the modular inverses of r-1 and c-1.
Then it initializes a variable sub to 0.
It enters another for loop and iterates from 0 to b-1. In each iteration, it calculates two values v1 and v2 using the factorial and modular inverse arrays. It then adds the product of v1 and v2 to the sub variable.
After the loop, it calculates the final value of res by subtracting the sub variable from it and taking the modulo with mod.
Finally, it prints the value of res as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
