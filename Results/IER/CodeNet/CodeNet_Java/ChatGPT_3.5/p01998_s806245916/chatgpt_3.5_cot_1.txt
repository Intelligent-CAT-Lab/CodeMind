<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to 3 with a step of 2. So it only checks the number 3.
Inside the for loop, it checks if both the current number i and i+2 are prime numbers using the isPrime() method from the Methods class.
Since 3 is a prime number and 5 is also a prime number, the condition is met and it adds 2 to the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
