<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` and checks if the last character of the string is a question mark ('?'). If it is, it enters the if block and performs some calculations to determine the value of `sum`. It then calculates the value of `sum` modulo 11 and assigns it to `sum`. If `sum` is less than or equal to 1, it assigns 0 to `sum`, otherwise it assigns 11 - `sum` to `sum`. Finally, it prints the value of `sum`.

If the last character of the input string is not a question mark, it enters the else block. It initializes `check` with the integer value of the last character of the input string. It also initializes `cnt` and `ans` with 0. It then enters a loop from 0 to 9 and performs some calculations to determine the value of `sum` for each iteration. It calculates the value of `sum` modulo 11 and assigns it to `sum`. If `sum` is less than or equal to 1, it assigns 0 to `sum`, otherwise it assigns 11 - `sum` to `sum`. If `check` is equal to `sum`, it increments `cnt` and assigns the current iteration value of `j` to `ans`.

After the loop finishes, it checks the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is equal to 1, it prints the value of `ans`. Otherwise, it prints "MULTIPLE".
