The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input. Then an array arr of size n+1 is created. The compute() method is called which fills the array with 1. Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 2 to n/2. In each iteration, it enters another for loop and iterates from i to n with a step size of i. In each iteration of the inner loop, it increments the value at index j of the array arr. After the first for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and iterates from i to n and increments the value at index i of the array arr. Then it initializes a variable ans with 0. It enters another for loop and iterates from 1 to n. In each iteration, it adds the product of i and the value at index i of the array arr to the variable ans. Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
