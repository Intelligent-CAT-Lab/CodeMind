<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers a and b from the input. It then calculates the sum of all the numbers between a and b (inclusive) using the formula (b-a)*(b-a+1)/2. Finally, it subtracts b from the sum and prints the result as the output.
In this case, a is 8 and b is 13. So the sum of all the numbers between 8 and 13 is (13-8)*(13-8+1)/2 = 6*7/2 = 21. Subtracting b (13) from this sum gives 21 - 13 = 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
