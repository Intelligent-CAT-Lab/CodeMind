<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three strings from the input: a, b, and c. The input string "AtCoder Beginner Contest" is split into three words: "AtCoder", "Beginner", and "Contest". The code then prints the first character of each word, which are 'A', 'B', and 'C', respectively. The output is the concatenation of these three characters: "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
