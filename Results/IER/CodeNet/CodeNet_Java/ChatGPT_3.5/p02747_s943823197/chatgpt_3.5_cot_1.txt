<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string from the user using the Scanner class. It then replaces all occurrences of the substring "hi" with an empty string using the replaceAll() method. The resulting string is stored in the variable "last". 

Next, it checks if the length of the "last" string is equal to 0. If it is, it means that all occurrences of "hi" have been removed from the original string, so it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

In this case, the input string is "hihi". When "hi" is removed from the string, the resulting string is empty. Therefore, the length of "last" is 0. So, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
