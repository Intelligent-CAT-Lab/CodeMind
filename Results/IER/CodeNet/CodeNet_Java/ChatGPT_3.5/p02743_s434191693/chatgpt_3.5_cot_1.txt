<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a method called sqrt() which takes a BigDecimal as input and returns its square root. It uses the Newton's method to calculate the square root with a precision of 50 decimal places.

In the main method, it creates an InputStreamScanner object to read input from System.in and a PrintWriter object to write output to System.out. Then it calls the solve() method passing the InputStreamScanner and PrintWriter objects as arguments.

Inside the solve() method, it reads three BigDecimal values from the input using the next() method of InputStreamScanner. It calculates the square root of each value using the sqrt() method and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.

Then it checks if the sum of a and b is less than c. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

So, the output will depend on the values of a, b, and c calculated from the input.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
