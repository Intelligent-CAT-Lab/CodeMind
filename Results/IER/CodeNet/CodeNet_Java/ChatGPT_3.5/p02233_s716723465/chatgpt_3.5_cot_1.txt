<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `arr` of size 45 and sets the first two elements to 1. Then it enters a for loop starting from index 2 and calculates the Fibonacci sequence by adding the previous two elements of the array. After the loop finishes, it takes an input `n` from the user and prints the value at index `n` of the array `arr`.
In this case, the input `n` is 3. So the code will print the value at index 3 of the array `arr`, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
