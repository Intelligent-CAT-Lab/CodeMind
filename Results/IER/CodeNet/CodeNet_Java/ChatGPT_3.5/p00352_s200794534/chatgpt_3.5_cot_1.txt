<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the console. It then reads two integers a and b from the input using the nextInt() method of the Scanner class. The code then calculates the average of a and b by adding them and dividing the sum by 2. The result is stored in the variable hannpenn. Finally, the code prints the value of hannpenn using the println() method of the System.out object.

In this case, the input is "1000 3000". The code will read the integers 1000 and 3000 from the input. It will then calculate the average of these two numbers, which is (1000 + 3000) / 2 = 2000. The code will print 2000 as the output.

<<<Output>>>
2000
