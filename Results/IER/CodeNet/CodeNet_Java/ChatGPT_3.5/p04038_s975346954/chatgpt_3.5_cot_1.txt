<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 and variable K is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It checks if K is equal to 1. Since K is not equal to 1, it continues to execute the rest of the code.
It calls the init() method and passes N*K as the argument. Inside the init() method, it initializes two arrays fac[] and rev[] with size N*K+1.
Then it initializes the first element of both arrays with 1.
It enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to N*K. In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current number and stores it in the fac[] array.
It also calculates the modular inverse of the factorial and stores it in the rev[] array.
After the for loop finishes, it initializes a 2D array dp[][] with size N+1 by N+1 and sets the first element dp[0][0] to 1.
It enters two nested for loops and iterates from 0 to N. In each iteration, it calculates the values of dp[i][j] based on the previous values of dp[][] array.
It uses the comb() method to calculate the combination value and multiplies it with the corresponding dp[][] value.
It takes the modulus of the result with MOD and stores it in dp[i][j].
After the nested for loops finish, it prints the final value of (dp[N][N]*fac[N])%MOD as the output.
