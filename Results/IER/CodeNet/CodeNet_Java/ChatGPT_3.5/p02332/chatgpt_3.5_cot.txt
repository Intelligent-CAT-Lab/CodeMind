<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and k from the input. Then it creates an instance of the Combinatrics class passing k as a parameter.
The Combinatrics class initializes three arrays: fact, inv, and finv. It calculates the factorial, inverse, and factorial inverse values for each number from 0 to n.
Then it calls the permutation method of the Combinatrics class passing k and n as parameters. This method calculates and returns the value of nPr (n! / (n-r)!).
Finally, the code prints the return value of the permutation method as the output.
